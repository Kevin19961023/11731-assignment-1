you know , one of the big <unk> travel traveling and a of the pleasure of the <unk> research , and to live with people who remember themselves at the old days . they &apos;re still in the bitter edges of the plant .
just knowing that <unk> still exists beyond the milky way or the meaning of the most myths of the inuit , or that in the himalayas the <unk> , the the <unk> of the <unk> , is the the the the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the case that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the case that the the the the the the the the world of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the case that the the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ,
and of course we share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
we &apos;re going to <unk> .
we have to come with the <unk> separation of the death and so we wouldn &apos;t be surprised that we all sang and dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> in the forests of borneo , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> , or a <unk> in the middle of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the middle of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the middle of the <unk> .
all of these people teach us that there are other people , other thinking of thinking , other ways to the earth .
and this is a sense that , if you think about it , you can only meet hope .
together , the cultures of the world is a web of <unk> and <unk> life , which the earth &apos;s earth and for the most important thing , as important as the biological <unk> that you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine that cultural <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> , as the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> ideas , <unk> , the <unk> of the human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness became been hijacked by the beginnings of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of mankind .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re an amazing species of the species .
and as the biosphere was devastating , this was the <unk> -- just with more than bigger .
no a biologist , for instance , <unk> , for instance , <unk> , that 50 percent or more of all species are just before the extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> in the field of biological diversity -- almost as far as a <unk> <unk> in the field of the biological diversity .
and the key representation of this is the extinction of languages .
when any of you born in this room , the earth has been talked about 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a way of the soul of a particular culture that &apos;s access to the tangible world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a sense , a thought , a way of an ecosystem .
and from these 6,000 languages , as we sit in monterey , just half of them are not going to be in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught , they &apos;re not taught , that &apos;s when nothing is done , you &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than being the silence of the last of the people who speak language to be the last of your people who speak language to the <unk> , the wisdom of the ancestor , or the hope of the ancestor , or the hope of the ancestor , or the hope of the ancestor , or the hope of the religious people ?
and yet , this horrible fate of actually happens to someone on earth about all two weeks , because every two weeks , a elderly , and the last <unk> of an old man , and the last <unk> of an old language .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place , if we all have language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s have this language of yoruba . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would see how it would be if you could not speak your own language .
so , i want to take you to a trip in a trip through the <unk> , a quick journey of the <unk> to try to understand what actually has lost .
now , there are some of us who are kind of forgotten that i say , &quot; different ways of his mind , &quot; really different possibilities of his .
take for example of this kid of the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , believe that they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of the east from the east of saint snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t have seen between color blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest is the human being <unk> .
they have a curious language and a <unk> <unk> <unk> , you have to get somebody who is a different language .
all of this is happening in the past past , and the <unk> of these big houses where the most <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , but that you never hear somebody who is learning a language .
you just hear and start to speak .
or , one of the most amazing tribes that i &apos;ve ever been in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first time in jail , the first year , the last year .
in 1957 , five <unk> <unk> , and they made a <unk> mistake .
they took a little bit of the pictures of the air , which we would have known as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that this people in their life never seen anything else in their life .
they were lifted these photographs from forest forest , trying to see the face , there was nothing and <unk> that this was the business of the devil and killed the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> would not only kill the <unk> .
they &apos;re each other .
70 percent of the deaths are happening through <unk> .
we monitored the <unk> eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death of death and when we were a <unk> of the people with a <unk> , they gave them that one of the people were so old that he died , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest , which was amazing .
their hunter-gatherers could smell the <unk> of the animal , from 40 steps , and determine what was the one of the owned .
in the early days of the , i got a really amazing job when my professor asked me to go to haiti , whether i was interested in haiti and <unk> the secret societies that were the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the poison that were used to make the <unk> of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the poison that were used to make the <unk> of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the poison that were used to make the <unk> of the strength
so , to give a sense of this <unk> point , i had to say something about this remarkable faith of the <unk> knowledge and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a very complex kind of <unk> worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you , the big world of what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> , whatever .
a continent is going on , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was a and <unk> , and it &apos;s simply the little bit of the little of this very profound way that the tragic of the <unk> diaspora .
but what makes you interesting is that life is happening between living and dead .
the living people are the spirits .
the minds can be from underneath the large water , answers on the rhythm of the life , so that the <unk> for a brief moment to god .
<unk> don &apos;t like to say , &quot; you white are going to church and talk about god .
we &apos;re dancing in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you will be <unk> by the spirit , how do you damage to ?
see these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal , not burning combustion , an amazing example of the mind of the mind that this is the <unk> of the mind that this is <unk> when it &apos;s in an extreme extreme .
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the <unk> of the sierra nevada in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old <unk> civilization , which the caribbean <unk> <unk> of colombia , and in row of the , , the <unk> moved to a <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only one that never had been conquered by the <unk> .
to the day , you &apos;ll be driven by ritual &apos;s <unk> , but the education of the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> are going to be in age three and four years from their families and in a <unk> world of the glacier at the glacier of the glacier for 18 years , they spend now in the lap of their mother &apos;s mother , they &apos;re now spending <unk> in the very large mother .
and during that time , they &apos;re culturally introduced in the values of their society , values that the statement is that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- the <unk> .
at the end of this amazing <unk> , they &apos;re going to come up after the first time in their life , at age 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this moment moment of the , the beautiful beautiful landscape of the , the <unk> starts to the in the abstract moment of the <unk> of the the , and the priest starts to the <unk> of the <unk> of the first beautiful visible of the , and the priest goes back .
it &apos;s so great . you have to protect it . &quot;
they &apos;re the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the world &apos;s the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of native and landscape , we &apos;re going to be <unk> and the old side of the fancy , which in its simplification is a <unk> thought about it , or the other hand , is a <unk> thought about nature , or the other hand , is the <unk> , or the other hand , is the <unk> , or the other hand , is the <unk> , or the other hand , is the <unk> , or the other hand , is the <unk> , or the other hand , is the <unk> ,
so , native are not <unk> , they &apos;re still going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
it &apos;s not a lot of place in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or the <unk> of tibet , but they still have , through time and ritual , a <unk> <unk> of earth , which is not the idea of being aware of it , but on a very much <unk> intuition that doesn &apos;t have the earth to be , because it &apos;s a <unk> hint of the earth that &apos;s not being aware of it , because it &apos;s a <unk> hint of the idea that the earth is on itself because
well , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the andean , which is the next one , that the mountain is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , will be a human , and a different relationship of montana , which is a tiny child of montana , which is a little bit of a <unk> of the <unk> , which is a little bit of a <unk> of the <unk> , which is a little bit of a <unk> of the <unk> , which is a little bit of a <unk> of the <unk> , which is a
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a sense of the mind or a bag of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are being able to become <unk> .
so , i made me to another people as my friends in the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits , the most <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , the
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of your extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph that i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , from many of you have heard of , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
what makes the most compelling power , it &apos;s not just the most powerful potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s what it does . it &apos;s actually made from two different sources , and on one hand , there &apos;s this wooden <unk> , which is a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
this plant contains a few very strong <unk> of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , how they <unk> this stuff , this substance that they contain from different species as well as they &apos;re using .
this powder is about as being from a <unk> of a <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create a distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have my professor , richard evan , the man who <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in mexico , and i argued that you couldn &apos;t be able to know that <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you cannot be able to know that <unk> , because of the moment you &apos;re hearing the effect of the , you don &apos;t know , you know , you &apos;re not there to know , you know , you can &apos;t be able to know that <unk> , you
but the thing about the <unk> is that they cannot be able to get <unk> , because they &apos;re naturally <unk> by a human gut , of course , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
they can only be able to be able to be able to <unk> with some of these chemicals that mao mao .
now , the intriguing thing is that the <unk> that are in the most of the <unk> , is the way that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> , so questions itself .
how can these people from an entire species of 80,000 species of plants that are not going to find these two <unk> plants , which is , in fact , in terms of the way , sort of , sort of , sort of <unk> version of the size of the parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which is a meaningless .
but what you say americans are saying , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> , which they all see in large ways in the woods , which are in the way that we see in the very large way of the eyes as a kind of seem .
and then you ask them how they put their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t even know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take any of the 17 varieties of <unk> and they &apos;re singing in a different <unk> of a different <unk> .
now , this is not a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
now , the most salient thing is the problem is that even those of us who are the <unk> of the <unk> of the people , they have to look at the past , but the way the way the world is , the world , the world , the world .
so , the fact is that you can &apos;t be in the 20th century , in 300 years , not to be able to be able to get to the wars of the wars or technological innovations , but rather than an era where we were in and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either either active or passively . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> don &apos;t heard less than less to the sioux than they accepted and the the ultimate tasks than americans americans are americans when they have the <unk> and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you will detect that these cultures are not the extinction of the extinction . these are dynamic living peoples whose existence are <unk> by <unk> forces , and now , in the case of the <unk> , the <unk> of a generation of <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
or if we go into the hills of tibet , where i studied a lot of work , you &apos;re going to see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the holocaust , the most <unk> extinction of people will become convicted of the , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle of the people , not only being convicted , but universally , as part of a <unk> .
and you cannot understand that suffering from the <unk> , if they didn &apos;t have seen it on the <unk> level .
i &apos;ve been traveling with a young colleague of <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and only when i went to the <unk> of the <unk> of the statistics of you , i was seeing the face of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as followers as followers .
that meant that he was assassinated during the chinese invasion .
his uncle fled to her holiness in the diaspora people got to nepal .
his mother was locked up as punishment for the crimes of the crimes .
he was in jail at the age of two years to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live .
the sister who did this courageous did was put into a <unk> .
one day she came out of <unk> on a <unk> <unk> and for those <unk> , for seven years , for seven years .
suffering is <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of the people is something <unk> .
and the end of the end , we are really before a choice , and at the end , we want to be in a <unk> world of the <unk> world of the diversity in a world &apos;s population ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said , before she died that it was their biggest fear that as we &apos;re heading towards a way , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;re not just going to see the entire bandwidth of the human imagination in a <unk> way , and forgot that there &apos;s ever been .
and it &apos;s <unk> to think that our species may have been in the past over 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and we &apos;re in this moment of the <unk> of the <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> of the priesthood and <unk> -- found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges we are facing in the ensuing millennia .
if we asked this <unk> of the importance of the human questions , you know , with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to be the way of what we are : people with all the conscious who are the importance of all humans and gardens have to be a space to be <unk> . and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the <unk> of the <unk> , when i went to the <unk> of the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful tale of his grandfather .
the eastern government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the <unk> years , the <unk> of our rule of our generation , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the dog &apos;s dog &apos;s dog &apos;s dog man &apos;s dog man .
the family that scared of life had all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit , the inuit , the inuit , the inuit , the <unk> are not afraid of the war , they use them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their base , this was originally made of fish that were associated in <unk> .
the man &apos;s man didn &apos;t fear before the arctic night or the white storm .
he <unk> out , leaving his pants off <unk> down and <unk> in his hand , and when the feces were exposed to the , it formed the shape of a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the side of the <unk> and it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> , took the skeleton of the dog &apos;s dog , and <unk> a <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
you can &apos;t do something like that .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the <unk> of the inuit and all the native native of the world .
the eastern government gave the <unk> of the <unk> in 1999 , full control of an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent field . they control all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the <unk> of the <unk> and achieve the <unk> .
and finally , i think , is , it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveling to these distant goals of earth , to realize that they &apos;re not going to be away .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination that &apos;s <unk> in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of the kids are the of the kids , how dreams of our own children are part of the geography of hope .
what we ended up with national geographic is that we &apos;re never going to achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not persuasive , but we believe that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means of a <unk> , and we &apos;re probably the best institution for the world . our website is 35 million <unk> every month .
so we <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re a series of traveling to the <unk> of the <unk> of the audience that we &apos;re going to take our audience to places from the <unk> , and hopefully , you &apos;ll think one after the other the most important revelation anthropology world : that this world has been making it , in many ways , that this world has been making it , in fact , to our <unk> , in fact , to our own well-being .
thank you .
what i first do you think about how you can , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;re in a part of a year , a year ago . and it &apos;s an environment , and it &apos;s an environment , and it &apos;s an environment where you can either deal locally or a large fraction of the visual data .
we see a lot of lots of thousands of <unk> of digital photographs here , which you can seamlessly in and continually <unk> , the <unk> , in any way .
and it &apos;s not matter how many information we think , how large these are the ones , or how large the images are .
most of you are digital photos of a camera , but this one is a scan of the <unk> of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a field of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the power of the system like this , is the number of pixels on your screen on every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . every <unk> is a chapter .
to prove that it really is a text , and not a picture , we can do something like this , to actually show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
each big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that is really the pleasure and the good experience of a genuine job magazine or a newspaper newspaper , which is a kind of medium to be multiple orders .
we also did something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a <unk> display with very resolution , which is much higher than a normal ad , and we added some additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see here .
or other models , or even a technical cluster .
and this is actually taking those ideas to the available to the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is not a <unk> and other rubbish , it &apos;s not necessary .
of course , this is the very simple applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , unless we say that we &apos;re going to be doing this part of this .
but these are all roads in the united states .
<unk> <unk> on the <unk> picture of nasa .
so let &apos;s get something else .
now , this is actually live on the internet . they can be <unk> .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really the two different technologies .
one is <unk> , and the other one is a very good research on <unk> , which from mr. <unk> , a <unk> of the university of washington , including by steve <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by <unk> .
you can see that , if we create these kinds of view of view where we can penetrate through images and this experience of the most complex resolution .
but the spatial structure of the imagery is that it &apos;s doing .
the <unk> have these pictures together , they &apos;re putting the real room that these pictures nearby nearby nearby <unk> in the canadian ridge , there are the elements of <unk> slides , and those things were all the spatial in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more nuanced .
i would like to show you a <unk> of the <unk> &apos;s data collection of noah , and this is from a early prototype of the <unk> of the <unk> of the last summer to show you what i think is the line of the <unk> behind this technology , which is not necessarily as much as you think of the the line of this technology .
we had to make ourselves about the lawyers and so on .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral , dame , who was just filled with pictures of flickr , and they &apos;re just going to be notre dame in flickr and and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and etc .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all in the same way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
so , you know , i never believe that i &apos;ll end up at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
so , i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : all about the <unk> of the <unk> of the professional <unk> , a fairly large number of them all in this environment were <unk> .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the weird .
many of you are covered by faces , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster by notre dame , which was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is here , we can do things with social environment , and now , now , data from all the collective memory of the whole collective memory of how , visual the earth looks -- and everything will be connected .
all of these photos are interconnected and it &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all over the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen <unk> to virtual earth .
and this is something that the people use it , and it &apos;s the use of the user , and the user is getting bigger .
your own photos will be <unk> with metadata that one of the other person .
if someone did it , and all of those saints are <unk> and who they &apos;re all all all of them , then my photograph is from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and i can use it as a start to dive into this room , in those cases , and so a way of <unk> <unk> of the other people and so forth , and therefore , a way of <unk> <unk> of the other people and so forth .
and of course , byproduct of all are the vast beneficial virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that are not only going through <unk> or cooperation and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
do i get it right ? how software is allowing you to have a certain point in the next few years , all the images that are used to be used in the world together in principle ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter as we can find .
if you want to make it <unk> between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting if you think of the amount of information that many of those images have .
how if you do a <unk> for pictures where you &apos;re drawing and the text of the site contains a lot of information about what &apos;s the picture .
but what if the picture of it , you know , what is your images ?
then the amount of the <unk> <unk> and the amount of that makes it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some of the things from my book , like i hope to do with other things you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make a few connections , if you don &apos;t have that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all the western societies .
the official <unk> works , if our goal is to maximize the leader of our citizens , this is particularly due to the <unk> of the freedom of the individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom is good , valuable , it &apos;s a <unk> premise for human .
when people have freedom , then each of us are about ourselves to do the good good and no one for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices , the more choices , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom you have , the more good you have .
this is , i think , so deep in our <unk> , that it would not come to the sense of it , it would be asking .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our life .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarkets . no big .
i want to just talk about something about the <unk> .
there are 175 <unk> in my supermarkets , if they don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> they could make a large number of their own <unk> , in unlikely cases that none of the reef in the store is right .
so that &apos;s the supermarkets .
and then you go to the <unk> business to a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio radio , radio , <unk> , <unk> , and in this one electronics there are so many <unk> plants .
we can put <unk> million different kinds of assets in the components that are offered to this one business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have any phone you wanted to have the phone , as long as he came from the old bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t have it .
a consequence of what was the phone was never broken .
those days are over .
now , we have almost an infinite choice on the phones , especially in the world of the mobile .
these are the mobile mobile phone .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that until now , you can be sure that they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it &apos;s bringing people to walk into the business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to that question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone , not to do too much .
in other aspects of life , which are much more than buying the objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor &apos;s doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to a doctor and the doctor says , we could do a job or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , &quot; if you were , you know what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; to &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift of the burden of the <unk> responsibility for making choices -- <unk> -- -- <unk> -- -- <unk> -- -- <unk> -- -- <unk> the doctor &apos;s <unk> -- to someone who is a little bit more than a matter of the -- <unk> of the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like they and me , that if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why do you think about if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you expect to call the doctor &apos;s doctor to the next morning and to ask a change of the prescription .
something like our identity is now a question of choice of the election , like this slide .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we make it .
and we often make us how much we want to do .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the most <unk> was that almost everybody had one and they could get them as fast as they could , and then quickly , kids got to get as they could .
the only true option was , &quot; who , &quot; when , not when , and not , what they did .
now , it &apos;s just easy to have .
i teach a wonderful student students , and i &apos;ll give them 20 percent less work than i used to be .
and that &apos;s not because they are less smart , and not because they &apos;re less careful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy things , they ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married ?
should i get married ? should i have kids , or should i have a career ? &quot;
those are all kinds of questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions of whether that means all the tasks that i can &apos;t do to get them and not good grade in my course .
and indeed , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re here , as carl <unk> shows us , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every one of the planet -- to the <unk> hotel .
there are a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you , the <unk> of the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions and again and again , if we should work and work , whether we should work or not work .
we can see our kids playing play playing football , and we have our mobile phone at the one , and our blackberry on other hip , and our blackberry probably our our our lap .
and even if they &apos;re all burst , every minute we &apos;re <unk> our child , the <unk> of a <unk> , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it &apos;s certainly a very different experience of your child &apos;s child &apos;s life .
wherever we look , big things and little things , tangible things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we saw in the world was like this .
so , i want to say there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world that we now are now looking at life .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;ll be about what &apos;s bad about this .
all those choices have two effects , two negative effects .
it &apos;s an effect , <unk> wise , is that he <unk> it .
so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide to all .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this , a study of investment in volunteers .
one one of me had access to me from me to <unk> from <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 <unk> of the employer , the <unk> , took the participation .
they &apos;re providing 50 percent of -- 10 percent less than if you only offer five of them , and why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> , which are the choices , it &apos;s hard to decide that they &apos;re going to delay it .
and then morning , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , it never happens .
understand that that &apos;s not just that , people who eat food , if they go to the average , because they don &apos;t have enough money to make it , it means that the choices is so hard to you get great <unk> of their employer .
not , they &apos;re not going to be doing , until 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> of the <unk> who had been happy to reproduce their contributions .
stereotypes is a series of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s what the world looks like this .
they want to really make the decision , if it &apos;s for all the time , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or even the wrong thing .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we go through the paralysis and make a decision , we end up less comfortable with the outcome of choice , than if we had the opportunity to choose to choose less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is to take a sense of the great choices , if you &apos;re buying one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is the <unk> of their choices , too , it &apos;s just imagine that you had a choice .
the more ways there are , the easier is not hearing any regrets , that &apos;s the <unk> for the election .
second , what economists call the <unk> .
dan gilbert has done a big point of this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things about what we compare it .
well , if there are a lot of different things to think , it &apos;s just to be <unk> properties of the alternative that you agreed , that makes you less happy with the choices that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have to think .
here &apos;s a few of the hamptons .
very expensive real .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it for himself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my most <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought that he accepted the opportunity to have a great amount of times .
<unk> increases the satisfaction that we get through our choices , even if what we have is that we have chosen .
and the more ways there are choices , the more attractive properties of those choices are going to be in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon is a few of the statements .
he does a statement about it now and maybe it &apos;s going to do things about things .
but a more important point that he &apos;s doing is : always who you decide to decide for one thing , don &apos;t decide to decide to do not decide to do things .
and these other things like that many attractive have have properties , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less .
three : <unk> expectations expectations .
this has been struck by me when i wanted my jeans to share my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which it was just jeans in a way , and they bought them , and they were bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and they had long enough , they started off .
so , to buy new jeans after a lot of years after the <unk> of the old ones , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the retailer said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , lightly <unk> or large ?
do you want to the buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want to holes jeans with holes ?
you &apos;d like to be <unk> , <unk> , blah , blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaws was down and after i recovered , &quot; i would like the way that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what was , so i spent an hour all this <unk> jeans and that &apos;s the business -- and i &apos;m saying the truth to the best appropriate jeans i ever had .
i had better . all those choices made it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book about trying to explain to me .
the reason that i felt worse , and all of those possibilities , my expectations for a good pair of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have a concrete expectations than it was only in a way .
when they came in 100 species , damn , one of them should be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had expected to do , and what i was was was disappointing in terms of what i expected .
so , the corresponding of the possibilities of people in the lives of people have the expectations of how good are that possibilities .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
none of the world &apos;s <unk> knows this . because if you would , you know , you would not know what it &apos;s going on .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , it used to be worse than anything was worse than anything was worse , was it possible for people to make experience the most comfortable .
today , in the world we live in the world -- we &apos;re affluent , <unk> citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best for you can hope to you , the best thing you can hope is the way you &apos;re supposed to do .
they &apos;re never comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all come from -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a quick moment -- a quick moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really quite amazing .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t get a <unk> .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
finally , a episode of the <unk> of a bad sitting in the jeans is that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you wonder why who is responsible , the answer is that . what could you do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re one of the <unk> , and you wonder why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question is .
they could have better do it .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse excuse for mistakes .
and so when people meet decisions , and even if the results of the choices are good , they &apos;re comfortable with them to be disappointed about it .
clinically clinical <unk> exploded in the industrial world
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> of this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have seen the <unk> because their standards have to explain themselves , because their standards have to explain themselves .
and so the <unk> is that it &apos;s better better , we &apos;re doing it , and we feel worse .
so let me remember .
this is the official <unk> that we all all of the right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is something that is something that is something more than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choices than something else .
there &apos;s a magic crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point for the reason that we have a better place .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost ready -- than a policy question that is thinking about think about what all of these choices are allowing to the industrialized societies , the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we heard of many of you , whose problem is not the big choice .
you &apos;re the problem that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and you &apos;re , steve <unk> shares you about how much of this site and difficult to <unk> the car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even do it .
it &apos;s not a good deal of doing it .
if something of what the people of our society enabled to make decisions to the societies where people would have to move to little choices , not only life , but our dignity would be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
it &apos;s going to be a concern that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of those big choices are <unk> .
finally , you know , reading this cartoon , and , a very advanced person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know nothing possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> &apos;s &quot; a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i got to the point of that fish .
because the truth is that if they break the <unk> , so that &apos;s possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so that &apos;s possible , you can &apos;t catch happiness .
they increases the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost possible to be secure , limited to the , possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for <unk> , and i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of these projects already talked about , about the human genome and what it could mean , and the discovery of the new groups of the gene .
in fact , we start from a new point : we have to have the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology by creating new life .
we always have to ask meaningful questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have to understand that many biologists have tried to understand and that at different levels .
we have a different approach to simplify it to the minimum components .
we have been being digitized about 20 years , as we sequenced the <unk> , the <unk> of the analog world of the world &apos;s analog world of the computer .
now we try to wonder whether we can regenerate , whether we can make a new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of a species , and we &apos;ve tried to get it with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map that is very simple , compared to ours , and that &apos;s easy , but if we &apos;re all of those genes we can actually detect one another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a live cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to the front of the , that chromosome is actually what we can actually be able to vary the individuals and so some of those fundamental questions .
and so we began to ask , we can detect an chromosome ?
does it enabled the chemistry to make these really large molecules , which is never done before ?
and if we can , if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemistry material .
our steps on the <unk> of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code , very slowly , but we &apos;ve got our last point now on an exponential curve .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it took a few years from now with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
it turned out to be very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world , and you can make the little bits of dna , and it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method that we can put together these little bits and fix the errors .
so this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome x 174 174 .
it &apos;s a smaller virus of bacteria .
we made little bits , they made a <unk> , and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical , and we gave a bacteria , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made a viral particles .
the viral particles were then pumped from the cells and we got back and kill e. coli .
i &apos;ve talked recently , and they said that they &apos;re just going to figure this model .
they laughing more than you do it .
so we think that this is a situation in software software , actually , in the software software , it can build on a biological system .
but we wanted to go further , and we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters code . so we thought we &apos;re building it in cassette cassette imaging , and we &apos;re building it in <unk> from the size of the virus to understand what the individuals of a living planet are .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome first in the united states , the average of the average was a 10,000 base base .
we found out the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , if we had the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make the things that are 50 letters long , and the other <unk> pieces of <unk> have to make to build smaller <unk> .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t. t. t. .
<unk> of these letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of those amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially we just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we put the pieces together so that we could easily easily easily easily easily easily easily . there are enzymes that repair those filters and again .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of the letters in the <unk> , put those together to <unk> these things together to <unk> .
in each step , we made these pieces in surplus surplus so that we could sequence it because we were trying to see a very robust process , which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of the .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we &apos;re to do to these right , -- with 100,000 -- then those don &apos;t just be able to move in e. coli . it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern biology , and so we used to get ourselves to other kinds of things .
we knew from a mechanism called <unk> <unk> , which uses the biology to fixing the dna that can communicate these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the top of that chromosome just apart .
12 up to 24 hours later , it &apos;s got back to the way it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do .
these organisms can be completely dried up , they can actually live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and moving , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has showed that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve created using these processes -- actually we use using the right design with the right design of the pieces . yeast actually drives them automatically .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
this is recorded over a period of six seconds .
so that &apos;s the equation we &apos;ve done first .
this is over <unk> letters to <unk> code , it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that &apos;s ever created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we put it with a <unk> of 10 and without &#93; <unk> , it would be <unk> pages , just to the genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we do it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple deal , it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s easier to be easier if you &apos;re in <unk> , like we &apos;re , you just take the nuclei out and there &apos;s another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you all know about the clone .
in <unk> , the chromosome is the chromosome in the cell , but only recently we have shown that you can actually put a fully transplanting of a chromosome from one cell to another , and that actually activate this .
we put the chromosome on a <unk> , roughly , , are these two as people and mice , and we gave some of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , and it was very amazing than we gave it in a cell -- and they &apos;re very amazing .
the new chromosome was going to the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get the process .
this is the <unk> of evolution .
we &apos;re all the species here that took a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , every one of thousands of <unk> in just a second species .
so people who have imagined an gene that has been going to have changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes the <unk> , which is actually digest dna .
the chromosome in the cell was not one ; the chromosomes we have in the right place .
it was <unk> in the cell , and it detects the other chromosome as foreign materials , and we had just a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes we had in the .
and after a very short period of time , there had all the characteristics of the species and <unk> and <unk> in a new species on the new species that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins shifted the membranes that we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;re going to have .
it may sound like genomic <unk> sound sound sound , but we can see the <unk> of things that are quite dramatic .
now i felt that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years ago .
and i have a myth that we might be able to put a new form of cambrian explosion in which there are massive new <unk> on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty apparent in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re from a six billion people in the next 40 years .
so , in my context , i was born in the year .
today , three people have been in this planet for everyone in the year alone , and within 40 years , it will be four .
we have trouble with food , with the fresh water and clean water , fuel for six billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
we need to be over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels . that &apos;s a hundred million drums a day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace it , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the entire co2 from this material that &apos;s going on the atmosphere .
we now have , from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million gene , and i want to believe that this is the most of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and see the diversity of this .
we &apos;re here in the first line of the biological reality and our idea .
we have technologies now because of this fast <unk> , to do what we call the <unk> genetics .
we have now able to build a big robot that we can make a big robot on the day .
if you can imagine that 20 million different genes , or to optimize processes and make the drugs , we can only change a little team more biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a photograph of the actual <unk> that we actually sit in and and new species on the computer computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what the genetic code will look .
we &apos;re now going to focus on the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn ethanol -- which is simply a bad experiment .
we have the <unk> of the <unk> and third generation that are relatively soon going to be the much higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way of dealing with with with it , a large impact , no increases in the cost of food , or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as the material , and therefore we work on cells that go to the way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and this is about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our world , we all have different kinds of different ways .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s co2 in methane to use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study whether we can use co2 co2 , which can easily be made into <unk> , <unk> the co2 in fuel to push this process .
in a short amount of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- <unk> targets like the <unk> of the entire industry industry . right . if you could do it at ted , where else ? a <unk> of energy .
but the same thing we &apos;re currently working on is to use the same way of vaccines to create vaccines .
they &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year in the back and have a dollar to a little bit if it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by creating <unk> vaccines in the building .
this is what the future might be possible with changes , can be accelerating today with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we are moved from the way of it , and our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to survive , thank you very much .
at the last ted conference i had an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain to you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s time . and for all those those who were not there , the lhc was the largest scientific experiment that the lhc was ever been solved -- 27 miles across the .
so his job is to create the conditions that less than a <unk> second , after the beginning of the universe -- and it &apos;s up to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
this is the machine underneath the soviet union .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
i &apos;m going to work . it &apos;s called a <unk> detector -- 44 meters down the size , 22 meters across the .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction of the construction of the assembly .
september september last september last year , the machine was going to be .
and this picture was taken from atlas .
it &apos;s got a huge amount of <unk> in the control control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that all the way the lhc would be <unk> , then with a part of the lhc , to the <unk> of the <unk> to the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on september 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a great victory .
i don &apos;t know if this was the largest <unk> of the ground , or this , as somebody came up the google side , and the front page front front .
it means that we have a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
about a week later , it was a problem with the machine that was to do with these wired , and this golden wires here .
these wires deduce <unk> , if the machine is on the <unk> .
now , the engineers , they &apos;re going to look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t do .
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very much down , you &apos;re going to be called the <unk> .
so at minus levels of magnitude , it &apos;s below the space between stars , can actually replicate these wires .
in one of the interconnections between the <unk> magnets at the lhc , there was a <unk> .
so it blew the wires and <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> <unk> .
this was the result .
now , this is what it &apos;s kind of , if you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 feet and down about 30 centimeters .
so we &apos;ve got about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to excise , which we did .
we &apos;re reinventing them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all going back to your journey .
so by the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> .
we &apos;ll turn it up , and expect first data to june or july , and we &apos;re going to go and take our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in some way these accidents have a <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> on this limit , it &apos;s easy to reject it .
i think it &apos;s so hard that it &apos;s so hard to the fact that we &apos;re going to reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as i suspect when he was the <unk> of his <unk> of his <unk> , his was an apprentice , which said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , his apprentice was , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , his apprentice was , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , and it was not a new way to conquer that there &apos;s
thank you .
i &apos;m a novelist .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , dear love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change the way .
but the recent thing is a very weird thing in my life and my career that i &apos;ve got to rethink my relationship to this work .
this curious event was that i wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- that , in fact , in the previous books , the previous books , and a large <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the result is that i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was going to be treated at extinction .
seriously -- at the fall , <unk> !
for example , they come to me and say , &quot; fear , you don &apos;t you , that they &apos;re never going to be going to be ?
do you have no fear of that they &apos;re all of their life and never again , the book that anybody in the world ? never again ? <unk> ?
okay , this is really the guts .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that , over 20 years ago , when i first told that i was told , i wanted to be a writer , who i wanted to be a writer , with the same kind of <unk> reaction .
people say , <unk> don &apos;t you fear , never succeeded ?
do you not fear that the humiliation of a <unk> kills you ?
do you not fear that you can &apos;t live in this country , and it never comes out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of those questions is : <unk> .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
and i always had .
and i have a lot of things that nobody would get to be a <unk> .
as algae -- and other things are happening .
but if it &apos;s about writing about writing about it , and i think , why ?
is the sensible ?
is it logical that it should be expected to be , that he was afraid to do the work that he &apos;s being violated ?
and what is the creative community that you &apos;re concerned about how we &apos;re concerned about how we are concerned about how the other jobs are doing , in a way of how do not do any jobs ?
my dad , for example , chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years than chemist , if he was afraid of whether he was afraid of being afraid of being .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you know it ?
it just didn &apos;t know , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not get the reputation of <unk> people .
we have a professional , but not just the author , but not just the author , but the creative of all the <unk> , seem to be incredibly unstable .
everything you have to do is , the bitter <unk> of really great head in the 20th century , the young , and often passed by their own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually have <unk> <unk> , seemed to be really neglected , the <unk> seemed to be .
norman <unk> said , shortly before his death in his last interview , <unk> each of my books have a little bit .
a very extraordinary statement that you can do about your work .
but we don &apos;t even make if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve heard this kind of <unk> for as long as so long , and somehow we have the notion of how we and collectively accepted and that , and , and , the end -- always leads to the end .
the question i want to ask for today is this idea for you all right ?
do you think that ? because only one of an inch , i think , -- i &apos;m not comfortable with this notion of all .
i think they were <unk> .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s going to be taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we &apos;re our big creative endeavors .
and i definitely know that it was me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , begin to begin to start this dark path of the presumption -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i &apos;ve got to go even 40 to me .
and it &apos;s probably the point of being in fact , that everything i &apos;m going to be about the world as the work that the most successful success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to say it , because we &apos;re now now friends , now , it &apos;s probably the fact that my biggest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thing that someone can get to start at 9 a.m. in the morning , to get gin , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would like to do this work that i love love .
so the question is : how ?
after a while , i think , after a while , i think , to be able to write a way of <unk> psychological construct .
and somehow i have to find a way of a way to make a positive distance between me and my very natural <unk> of how the reaction to be on the writing .
and as i &apos;ve been looking for models for the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i tried to find other societies to see whether they might be better or more comfortable ideas about how to help creative risks , and the emotional risks that are linked to creativity .
and this is me to find myself into the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece , and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that , all of the people are coming , okay ?
they believed that , a kind of <unk> <unk> was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which from a distant , unknown , unknown , the people -- from <unk> , <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates now , he felt he would have a <unk> that was going to tell him a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of the <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the didn &apos;t really think that a genius didn &apos;t really like a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius that was sort of interesting <unk> nature was , was that literally , literally , in the walls of a life of life -- about how <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> of the work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i spoke to the -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked so well ?
the artist &apos;s <unk> was <unk> about things like , for example , too much insecure , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at all of you , and everybody knew that you had this genius genius that helped you have helped .
if your work is <unk> -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was a little paralyzed .
so , people in the west have thought about all the time of creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s make the human individual into the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for mythical creatures , which is the orders of divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational humanism , and people began to believe that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time you heard people , or an artist , you know , i &apos;m a genius , &quot; instead of it , that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
do you know ? i think a naked person , that he thinks he or it , he &apos;s like the <unk> , like the pelvis and the and the source of all divine , creative <unk> is a little bit too much to a too much too much to a too much too much to a too much too much to a too much too much to a much too much to a much too much to a much too much to a much too much to a much too much to a much too much to a
it &apos;s like somebody to ask the sun to swallow .
the <unk> and warps of the whole egos , and it creates all those <unk> expectations of success .
i think this <unk> of the <unk> has been violated our artists last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t look at the <unk> of 500 years of admittedly in a <unk> &apos;s lecture .
and there are certainly people in this audience who really <unk> most scientific <unk> doubt about the idea of -- -- <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to ask is : why not ?
why don &apos;t we think ?
because it makes much sense of all the sense of all the other that i heard about , if it was about trying to explain the completely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that -- like any one know that it has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , they &apos;re not always rational .
in fact , it can sometimes feel like that .
i had a similar encounter with the <unk> of the <unk> of the stone <unk> stone stone stone , which is now about 90 , but she told me she was growing up in the <unk> virginia , and she told me she was in the <unk> virginia , and she told me that she would feel and hear how a poem about the landscape .
she said it would be like a <unk> train of air .
the country on the land would be <unk> .
she felt when it came up , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could only do one moment , and this was -- in their words , <unk> , like the devil .
she ran the way to the house as she was being tracked by this poem , and it was the only thing that she quickly had enough to a paper paper and a pen , so it had to be able to capture it through them , and to capture the paper .
in other painting she didn &apos;t get quick enough . she ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and the poem rolled through her and she said it , and she said , &quot; <unk> after another poet .
and then there were those moments -- i &apos;m going to forget , she said that there were moments in which they almost had them .
so , she runs for the house and he looks for the paper and the poem drives through her and she grabs a pen just as it would reach and get to the <unk> .
she was the poem on his tail , and she moved back into her body and took it on the paper paper .
and the <unk> came out of the poem and then the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
when i heard that , i was a very sinister thing -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going to be .
it &apos;s not how my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i have to get up at the same time and sweat , and sweat , and i &apos;m really awkward <unk> .
but even i put this thing in my <unk> , sometimes , this thing .
and i guess that many of you have done that .
even i had been working on the or ideas that i could actually not able to do , and i can &apos;t see .
what is this ?
and how do we have to lose with that in relation to our minds , but we &apos;re actually in the opposite to keep ourselves in the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best thing is the best living , how do you create this , the musicians can be the musician , and i was to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom <unk> the embodiment of the <unk> modern artist who was trying to handle these <unk> creative pulse that were staying in him , and with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going to wake up on a freeway in los angeles , and there was all the way for him .
he was driving at a very much time when he suddenly hear a little patch of a melody , which is the way it &apos;s a lot of , for him , it &apos;s hard to be <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to be able to get this old <unk> in the <unk> , like <unk> , i &apos;ll end up this thing and will be chasing from this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
he ended all the of the surgery and did something completely new .
he looked just in the sky and said , &quot; <unk> sorry , can you see that i &apos;m going to drive car ?
so , i &apos;m like i could say that i could say that i &apos;m going to write a song ?
if you really want to be there , come back to a moment , when i can take care of you .
if not , <unk> , anybody else .
go and leonard cohen cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . they &apos;ve been as dark as the ever .
but the process and the <unk> <unk> that surrounds him was the <unk> of the genius , and he took it out of nowhere , and he got him in the way , and he realized that it had no <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , surprising , bizarre collaboration between tom and the <unk> , <unk> , , the <unk> , , the <unk> , , the <unk> , , that wasn &apos;t a very tom .
when i heard this story , it has a little bit of the way i work and i &apos;ve been rescued .
this idea of me , when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and i fell in one of those cases in one of those cases , when we &apos;re doing it , and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s the worst book that ever written .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i began to think , i should just do this project .
but then i remember how tom had been talking to the free sky , and i was trying to do it .
so i took my view of the manuscript and i talked to my comment on the side of the room .
i spoke to the <unk> , you know , you , you , you and i have both , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m all seeing everything i have , put it . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to show up here and your percentage of agreement .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , the devil is .
i &apos;m going to write , because this is my job .
and i want to give you to go to the protocol that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... ... at the end , it &apos;s like this . they &apos;ve been trained to <unk> people with sacred <unk> with sacred dances and the music that stopped for hours -- to dawn .
this strong ones were great because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , again , very rarely , it happened to be special , one of the performers , actually , was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , i mean , i know that you &apos;ve seen a performance in your life .
it was the time that time was <unk> and the dancers of a kind of <unk> , and he didn &apos;t do anything else as he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but it was all together .
and suddenly he didn &apos;t seem to be human anymore .
it was lit off the inside and down from the bottom and down the <unk> and everything <unk> through a <unk> fire .
when something happened , people knew what was that . they called it on his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god .
so this is god , you know ?
interesting historic : when the <unk> <unk> came to the <unk> , they were to <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk>
if a performer in spain has something an educational , something magical is done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> look .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer himself wakes up , and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 clock on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> of god in himself .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe it will never be going to be up to these heights .
and maybe god will not be a god &apos;s name , if it &apos;s going to turn , but what should he start with the rest of your life ?
it &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so much as much as being from the beginning , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of their being came from them .
if you just think they &apos;re a <unk> -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> period of life , which is passed on somebody else when they &apos;re done .
if we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think , in the past months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s going to be coming up -- than the dangerous , terrifying , strong , <unk> .
what i &apos;m constantly saying to say , if i &apos;m crazy about it , is not a fear .
not <unk> .
just do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution , whatever he might be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the silly divine genius that you asked to the side , decide for a brief moment of wonder by your work , then <unk> <unk> ! <unk> !
and if not , dance , but dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you all of this .
i think i have the feeling , we should teach it .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you all of this , just for you , that you have the mere human love and the <unk> , for you .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic sea , which is the size of the size of the bottom of the bottom of the lower , but 40 percent is .
but this doesn &apos;t press enough enough of this particular problem because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic the the top of our global <unk> .
she grows in the winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide i show you is a <unk> of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is tagged .
as you can see , it &apos;s the <unk> , but this is the largest ice in the winter ; it &apos;s <unk> in summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old , is almost like blood , which is the body of the body .
it &apos;s going to be gone from here in 25 years .
this is a problem because the warming is the the frozen bottom of the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of carbon emissions , which is , if it &apos;s going to be <unk> from microbes from microbes to methane .
compared with the entire amount of material materials in the atmosphere , could be double to the amount of time when we cross this critical point .
already today , <unk> in some tropical lakes in alaska from itself in the water .
professor <unk> was in columbia with another <unk> lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how do it take us to do .
and one reason is , this huge <unk> of greenland greenland is from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are significantly bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in greenland greenland .
if you want to know how sea level goes down , down here , they &apos;re going to be <unk> into the sea .
these rivers are getting a very rapid rate .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers have been explorers that the entire continent has now has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that has happened over a few of the <unk> , is particularly much in the melt .
this is the equivalent of 20 feet , like greenland greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the new lakes that were facing a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
in the andean hemisphere , this glacier is the <unk> of the city .
the <unk> have expanded .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s going to be most of the water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the sierra union of the sierra .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions you &apos;ve read you are serious .
this <unk> in the world has a dramatic increase in the world .
and the disasters all over the world has been in a really <unk> unprecedented , unprecedented extent .
they &apos;re all the <unk> of the last 30 years as in the <unk> <unk> .
this is a perfectly <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it &apos;s <unk> .
over the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 -- 25 million tons of tons of every day .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent of west and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there is a kind of a dramatic decline in the oceans .
the biggest one factor for global warming , alongside logging , which is 20 percent , burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most part of the problem .
the united states are one of the most largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was , many more <unk> , many more .
but we begin to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken over the last few years with some green alternatives that were been suggested .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have been spent a <unk> dollars last <unk> to promote clean coal , which is already a <unk> .
this is a picture of me .
so , around christmas , at home home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of america &apos;s land .
this is what happened to christmas .
one of the commercials of the <unk> of the <unk> of the christmas man &apos;s <unk> was this .
<unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> , happy fellow .
it &apos;s in shell and abundance in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> is <unk> every day .
he &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers remain in the <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
so let me just say , &quot; well , &quot; al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate change is called the two priority .
this is one , part of her .
in the climate crisis , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so , we set up to the top <unk> , a sizable <unk> <unk> to get a <unk> on the way to get the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s smelling well .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s give it to that quiet .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , making a clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the green .
and yet , the burning of the key to global warming is the most amazing <unk> that you see here , it changes everything .
look at it , this is the most clean <unk> .
finally , the positive choice of our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that unites all of the one is our dependence on <unk> fuel as dirty coal and oil .
but now , there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get us from that <unk> .
<unk> america with 100 percent cleaner electricity , over the next 10 years .
a plan of bringing america back to work , to make us safer and help the global warming .
finally , a solution , the large enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america are new . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the quickest way , our dependency on the dependency of ancient , dirty fuels that our world are poisoning our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good jobs .
<unk> america : it &apos;s time to take a sense of life .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , you &apos;re going to go .
if you want to go close , go together . &quot;
we have to go to the , and quick .
thank you .
i want to ask you to ask you to the time of your childhood , when they played with <unk> .
as they realized how you were reaching the hands and <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , and moving , they actually learned to understand and change the way that we understand and change the <unk> of the things .
so the spatial reasoning is connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleague , i began to wonder : what if we could use computers , which if we could use computers , which if we could use computers , which if we could actually intervene with both the computers , which is the way that a digital <unk> system is moving ... ...
and this question was so profound that we decided to explore the answer and we were developed .
in short , a <unk> is a interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can be able to see your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important : are physically , so you can just keep them as <unk> by the <unk> of your hands and access to it .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> <unk> to manipulation of the <unk> .
and if those tools are physical and a conscious awareness for your movements , each other and the intricacies of our <unk> of our <unk> are , we can start with the study of new and more entertaining <unk> .
i start with a couple of simple examples .
this is the <unk> of the <unk> , and if i <unk> it in a direction , the video is going to play the video , if i pull it back into the direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other .
so , if i put them together , you &apos;re interested in the interest .
if you &apos;re <unk> , you can see that , and you can be a little bit more nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling your movements and <unk> .
and an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like the way you do this with fluids .
in this case , we have three <unk> than <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle of the center where they &apos;re then being mixed .
if we go back , we can do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
there are also a lot of nice ways in education as talking about math , math , where we can give people the opportunity to get the way of fast trial and the results immediately .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci number i &apos;m with a simple <unk> .
this is a game of words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of the <unk> every single day of <unk> letters and you &apos;re trying to train words , you &apos;ll be a <unk> .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , again , and you have a new <unk> and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are a few kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to go and put it a video of it .
they really loved it .
now , an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are some people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> down there .
it turned out that he wanted to sell the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by taking the <unk> of the table that shows this character .
here he is the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good work ! yes !
by the <unk> , and she puts it to side , and it can put the characters ...
... his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open end and he can decide how they evolved .
<unk> <unk> .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today is a <unk> for <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed as sound as sounds like <unk> , bass and drums act .
each have four different features ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can actually put those sounds into the sequence that you can actually put in any patterns in any patterns .
and you &apos;re a , by just putting a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that can be able to change the live , like reverberation and filter .
you put it with a single note , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
and then the bigger effects as speed and volume , which you put in the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s go .
we start in that , in which we &apos;re in two <unk> of the <unk> , and this one in a series of <unk> , they &apos;re going to add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something more on the .
and now i &apos;m putting the filters to the drums to drive the effect of life .
i can go back the sequence , by the speed of the speed of the <unk> .
and now i &apos;m putting the filter on the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it can change .
it doesn &apos;t have to plan it in the process , but it can improvise ; they &apos;re going to shorten it .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence of the whole sequence by looking at the <unk> .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire to develop new <unk> , to develop the better way of our brains and bodies .
and today i had time to give you a part of these new <unk> and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working in our lab .
the idea i want to give you to the way that we &apos;re at the brink of the new generation of <unk> to the digital world , the information that &apos;s going to bring us to our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking about all of you !
yes , good day .
i &apos;m very thankful to me .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i have to step a little bit , and it &apos;s busy <unk> with the modern biology biology .
i study biology , and i &apos;ve been studying biology biology , and i &apos;ve been doing this , because i &apos;ve been able to know , because i wanted to know , and it was really wanted to do it , and it was really what i &apos;ve learned from studying in studying .
so , this was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of the matter .
i think the biology overall general , so , in general , is all the things that you &apos;re passionate about synthetic biology and so on .
it &apos;s extremely important , now , extremely important , and much more important will be become in the future .
there are so controversial things like this whole genetically engineered plants to the <unk> .
now there are craig venter in the <unk> of the <unk> , which is trying to create <unk> , which is a <unk> of algae .
and there are things that are absolutely in the middle of the everyday , which most people aren &apos;t aware of , for example , <unk> that allow us to wash with <unk> degrees of laundry , and are also <unk> <unk> .
and the list can continue on .
and so , from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m going to go on this technology .
so what &apos;s now <unk> ?
most people know that from the <unk> .
so , hack , and then it &apos;s always like that , yes , the hackers break somewhere in a and <unk> and so on .
so , this is a very sad thing for the <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t matter what they actually actually started what it actually started , and what is actually behind it .
and they have the <unk> , in the <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about with a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a <unk> , which is how things can take , so whatever things do , so whatever things do , so you can do it .
and it was just all the time , but there are also a <unk> , but there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that &apos;s all kinds of <unk> things .
and now , in terms of biology , and i want to be this metaphor that comes from the most synthetic biology , assuming that biology is actually a <unk> code , because it &apos;s a abstract code , because it &apos;s a bit of a abstract code , which is the matter of the , because it &apos;s a matter of the computer , because it &apos;s a matter of the computer , because it &apos;s a matter of the computer , because it &apos;s a matter of the computer , because it &apos;s a matter of the
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also programming it and you can also programming it , and it &apos;s kind of hack , and i found it incredibly fascinating , and i wanted to get a lot deeper .
now , this is actually actually <unk> eight , and it &apos;s actually accepted the shape , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is linked to europe and with cooperation in india , but now , scientists , and the elderly , but now , members of the world has been around the world .
so that &apos;s a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and work working with scientists with the scientists to process and to process and to the creative process , and you can see it .
but it &apos;s actually about to find such a <unk> access to a kind of an open approach to have a kind of material to have to have a kind of material to do it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is the <unk> of the network , which is actually a kind of forum , where you &apos;re going to stop and talk online .
and those are a bit of a <unk> and a little bit of a <unk> road , and there are also so , <unk> questions .
and from those networks , the whole popular thing has done , it &apos;s actually a scene that i want to take a moment .
so here in the upper left , you see , that &apos;s a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , , a non-profit , a non-profit , , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit , a non-profit
kids , old , all kinds of people go to that , just by just flipping through it , and look at what you can do when those <unk> .
here &apos;s a group in indonesia , <unk> is the one , but it &apos;s been a pretty long .
it &apos;s been longer than those other two networks .
and they are also in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , and it &apos;s also <unk> , and combine it in a very way of a .
a group of ankara i &apos;ve met for a while ago , which is a <unk> that would say , the public , the way you want to learn to the public , what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;ve got to explain the way that is <unk> .
and i put a lecture on the other picture in copenhagen at copenhagen at the medical museum , and i &apos;m a show of the theme .
and that &apos;s , yes , this is a fairly young people , but the only thing that one is in the one is all the united , is this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with it and you just respond to the society that &apos;s going to be <unk> and ask , &quot; okay , what you want to do , you have interest to you to bring you to bring you to bring you to bring you ?
so , <unk> , to hack biology , you need some material .
you need biological materials , and you need to be , but it &apos;s a lab .
or what you &apos;re normally understands in a lab , these are sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> academics , a trained academic , <unk> academics , <unk> academics , and so on .
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do it .
so , this is not necessary because every <unk> has actually actually devised more sophisticated technology , as most of the most , , it &apos;s really like this .
and the chandler &apos;s , with this premise , for example , brian <unk> in england , a <unk> <unk> , then a <unk> , and , and it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s how it works .
so , one of which is a little bit of soup of the <unk> , which he has been left to long , it &apos;s done .
i &apos;ve tried this in my lab at home , a little bit , and then i put it on ebay on ebay and a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to do a <unk> , so as a <unk> <unk> , , i &apos;ll go home .
now , this is not really a joke , but it &apos;s a joke .
so here in the picture , you see the lab , in <unk> , so a <unk> garage , and so , as much as it has a <unk> , a group in paris that has been in place and quite interesting things , and it &apos;s pretty interesting stuff , and it &apos;s pretty interesting stuff , and it &apos;s pretty interesting stuff , and it &apos;s pretty interesting stuff , and it &apos;s pretty interesting stuff , and it &apos;s really quite interesting stuff , and it &apos;s pretty interesting stuff , and it &apos;s pretty interesting
and this is <unk> , which is also mentioned , this is , this is , as a kind of <unk> principle in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s the people who are alone to work alone to large larger , so far larger organizations that are able to do the more <unk> in <unk> .
but always always the idea that it &apos;s just easy to be and accessible .
the first project we did as an international group , as we were in our own selves , we &apos;re actually aware of the , we &apos;re now , and we &apos;re all of the people who are always chatting and so .
and then came from the <unk> <unk> website of the founders , and he said , well , we have to meet , and , we have to meet , and then , two of the things , and then the two points , one in london , <unk> 10 , and just a moment in san francisco .
and , there was also , , yeah , , yeah , who are we , what do we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our goals , our foundation ?
and there we have a <unk> <unk> .
so this was quite intuitive , so everybody just got the wishes , and what it moves , it moves , then .
there was , i think , a very good code .
and we have this idea of not <unk> , but that &apos;s because i think it &apos;s pretty well on the , and the people are very comfortable with this .
and we actually tried to do this in the world , and it &apos;s not the <unk> world , but there &apos;s no way there .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> of the <unk> in the ways of the world &apos;s academic world .
yeah , what do we actually do this ?
a project that i did with the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> himself was that we were using a so-called visual signal or visual <unk> .
this is if you &apos;re focused a beam beam , in a room , then you can put it into little particles in the air , or in the fluid , and then , in this focus , , so , that &apos;s the way that you &apos;re like , as a principle of principle .
it really works , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in the academic <unk> , and we thought , <unk> , we might get a webcam , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens ,
you can see this down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> the lasers , and then tries to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve got a lot of learned a lot of learned .
so a different project that came out of the french group in paris , which is pretty cool .
and he &apos;s got a kind of like a <unk> , so <unk> , so , as it &apos;s like , so it &apos;s got to work with <unk> , his <unk> is sam .
he then got this seat that &apos;s built this helmet , and in the cooperation of the museum .
and then , the visitors could go in the room in the room , on this chair , sitting on this seat .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought they thought , or how they thought , is then different kinds of lights in the room .
was a pretty ambitious project .
another thing from the united states , which is also the same thing to do with this <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to replicate , replicate , <unk> , fragments , so you can make it visible .
so , if i do this , the <unk> of the crime , then , collecting any <unk> , and then they can do this method , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair , that hair belongs to that people , so .
and the machines that are doing something like this , they &apos;re pretty expensive ones that you would get commercially , the molas go off like this .
and that &apos;s not the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they have so two of the <unk> <unk> and said , <unk> , we &apos;re doing it easier and cheaper , and then we have open source , so free , so that &apos;s the cheapest supply of those devices .
i think , like six dollars or something like this .
but in every case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in a context where it &apos;s clearly available .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project i started with a little bit recently was to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is a way that it &apos;s about two inches or so far .
you get <unk> on <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , and then i put the <unk> and then , and then the <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to be able to the light .
so the device you see here , it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype , but it &apos;s pretty <unk> , so a branch , the thing on it , electronics , and it was the pressure to the , the thing was broken .
and then i took a <unk> , and this is a connected .
a <unk> , if you &apos;re full power with water , the enough pressure , so i think , as 40 as you &apos;re going to get down at the top line .
and so you can then get the particles and then go and then go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs costs about 450 euros or something like that , <unk> , so , <unk> , so much .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially possible .
so , that &apos;s the <unk> of the scene of the scene , that the capacities of technology and also the information that &apos;s more people can get into .
because , as the first thing , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively bit of it , and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you just read about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same as you did it yourself .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make a zillion citizens and make good decisions in society , and you want to join , then you need to know the access to knowledge and to the technology .
and you have to do it and understand how to do it and understand .
and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and science of science .
so that you can be able to get into the situation , and you &apos;re going to be able to do with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who at least officially put on the website , <unk> website .
now , this is a relatively substantial number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is that you are examples of fibonacci scientists .
i think that &apos;s because there are fewer people , than in fact , in fact .
so i know some of those who don &apos;t have .
and those are just the <unk> , the individual people .
partly , in partly , , these places together , they put together .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> has begun to start .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> was the first one .
and this is a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> , that &apos;s all the world &apos;s all over the world .
and we &apos;re hoping that we &apos;re able to expand and expand and also the same thing that can be be done , so that can be more people .
and i would invite everybody to be able to get to and even even what i &apos;m trying to do .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get there too .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s the .
yes , hi .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moving as a designer , but also in the realm of the <unk> and in the <unk> of all the things in the field of the <unk> .
there &apos;s how you have to have people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and so that they can generate a very large experience .
and i think the architecture of interactive media in us are <unk> , cognitive models , so that we have in our biological memory , so , very long time ago , and that we can actually create the only through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that this <unk> , you &apos;ve seen that that &apos;s actually going to be in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s the future of the future , but in fact , the future is right in us , in our <unk> roots .
what are actually more urgent models ?
i &apos;ve got four <unk> <unk> , and i want to explain to the point .
to <unk> cognitive models , and those are the models that we have in the tense .
to these <unk> models , we have a principle of the virtuality .
this is basically unusual .
i &apos;m going to take a second and i &apos;ll show you that , and i &apos;ll show you that it &apos;s a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been able to talk to this <unk> models in the situation , but we &apos;re now using a language language .
and the third part of the , which is actually the way of itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition , which is the denial of linearity , and what we say is that we &apos;re the linearity as normal .
the fourth point is that the story is a place of the <unk> .
so , what about the virtuality is the most basic thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors did the house in which they live ?
we won &apos;t immediately answer that , but it &apos;s going to happen to this , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through this house in <unk> , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re <unk> the reality , and it &apos;s absolutely no computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there &apos;s hard to take the virtual reality in our <unk> , and we can actually see that the whole time .
and this wealth of the <unk> of the reality that people have had the most <unk> in the most cases , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have a books .
or they didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass mass .
the only thing that had had was her head .
and in this head , the memory was going on .
in this head , knowledge has been <unk> and with this virtual images , the imagination , were been able to know .
and therefore , it &apos;s so much in us that we can handle that virtuality with virtuality .
the interesting thing is , if i &apos;m going to make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that at this time of the human being <unk> and medium itself .
now , if you &apos;re going to think a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
what are the media ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll get to speak a moment .
central tool of the <unk> have been stories for the past .
<unk> , priests , so-called <unk> , were <unk> to keep knowledge of knowledge .
and we &apos;re very , very much of stories , and we &apos;re very much about stories .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we &apos;re still <unk> every year , <unk> hours of stories with the <unk> of stories .
that means for a kid that it all the way to the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most spent of the most of the most of the most spent of the most of the most of the most spent of the most of the most of the most spent of the most of the most of the most spent of the most of the most of the most spent of the most of the most of the most spent of the most of the most of the most spent
now we think our love to stories is that we have a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no , no .
it goes back to a lot of time , in the cultures of the time .
but for me , but in the realm of interactive media , as special as it is that we have an <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think .
i &apos;ve brought you an example of the north <unk> tribe of the <unk> .
and life lived in the <unk> of the british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate to island island to island to the way .
and they &apos;ve done this with so-called <unk> .
you may know , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in that , from the australian <unk> .
they have similar principles .
they have no <unk> , but they have the so-called <unk> <unk> , or <unk> .
and what the interesting thing is that the navigation and the topography of the areas of the bay was being mapped .
and where the language of <unk> was being violated .
that &apos;s , you &apos;re talking about sounds and over the rhythm .
and these sounds and the <unk> , geology , the topography of a region , and that &apos;s obviously enabled you to be able to get these songs and and the way back to the left , and back to the left , and again , to the left , and again , back to the left , and again , back to the left .
why don &apos;t we sing , but to get from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what is it ?
it &apos;s what happens as the most reliable machine machine .
we &apos;ve been in so-called <unk> , the so-called <unk> .
it &apos;s the age machine , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the <unk> .
and that is exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories have shifted to external media .
and on the book and the picture .
so we can actually be a piece of god of god &apos;s day .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and it &apos;s not a <unk> of the reality .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> of the <unk> , is so far to say that this mass mass , he says the book and the image , so on , and so on what we &apos;re talking as mass mass , that these mass mass mass of our memories are <unk> and our ability to <unk> .
do a little <unk> .
the <unk> of the age of the age of the age of the age .
what has influences on our thinking and our <unk> ?
then the <unk> forces of the ancient cultures .
and those are the over the course of the centuries and more <unk> , by the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , if we have to remember , we have standardized , far , common , mass patterns of memories of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
we have an abstract language of a <unk> language .
we don &apos;t think of the things that are not in pictures of things , but we &apos;re <unk> them our language .
we &apos;ve used to this to that things that things are used to us .
and we have the linearity and the law accepted and there are only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left is the <unk> .
we still have the <unk> as a <unk> , very strong .
the question is , what is now ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine machine machine machine machine machine machine , and we &apos;re now now called the so-called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very much like science fiction .
but these ideas of the <unk> , which is the way that we get back to see ourselves back to our capabilities back to our abilities .
there &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to tell you a little bit of a little bit .
there are the principal concepts like the <unk> reality , which is the extended reality .
so if you look at google <unk> , you know , then a concept of what the virtual world is combining the world &apos;s virtual world , which is our <unk> <unk> , the virtual , the virtual , , it &apos;s going to be a little bit normal , natural , it &apos;s coming back .
another example is this virtual reality .
so , of course , of course , i don &apos;t like , of course , in the context of my presentation , we &apos;re not going to be physically <unk> , virtual worlds , the way of the <unk> .
and other one another example are the <unk> , intelligent systems .
these are the rooms that are intelligent intelligent on a human .
all this needs to be the ability to take a sense of oneness as a real habitat .
i &apos;m hoping , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the two are the most <unk> are here .
maybe you can get up to get up , so you can go up and entertain you in the room with the project .
and i &apos;ve got this project for example , as an example , how back to this <unk> , cognitive models .
all of this is a game , i have to say .
what the most of of of course , extremely <unk> , and it &apos;s a game game .
and if i say , if i say , you know , you &apos;re very likely to see that any people who are <unk> or some <unk> <unk> , or they &apos;re playing with some of the <unk> .
in case , they do this in the way .
this is a game for the outside .
and this is <unk> , i think that i &apos;m the outside world , so i can discover the real world .
and this game combines connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize that i have to be so badly .
you can tell you , you can tell you much more much , there &apos;s more much more .
and it &apos;s why i &apos;m going to discover a city by looking at what the places were positive or negative <unk> .
and so i &apos;m going to be a completely different view of the , a very different impression , i see negative and positive zones of a city and and so on this way , a different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now look at this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world in our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize that , my my my talk , and in the sense that the properties and the ability that we &apos;ve been doing from the <unk> <unk> , and that we &apos;ve got a little bit more <unk> , that the way that we have been able to get back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very happy to be able to be able to be .
i &apos;ve been wondering if this bag is a bag bag and i &apos;m going to speak .
it won &apos;t do that .
i &apos;ll also get out what &apos;s inside in there .
but i &apos;m going to do it on the first time .
yes , kids are from nature , whether are curious , and , designers , designers .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m also involved with the subject of curiosity and how much as the curiosity , and why we might have to be curiosity and have to go back and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re concerned with the actual experience of the physical experience as a personal sense .
when professors are being curious , they &apos;re often going to be in the n of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had done last year .
a <unk> of the subject of natural design .
now , you &apos;re going to wonder why all the whole journey of the <unk> of the communication of communication , and <unk> , and so on .
and there &apos;s one of these little devices up , because the things are still more intuitive , always natural , <unk> , and you have to see what &apos;s actually <unk> , or the brain .
and before the background , i have been able to show myself in the field of natural design , so the next generation of the human computer in the front of the human computer , how our tools or how much of the computer in the computer is changing the computer of the computer .
so i &apos;m busy trying to see when i &apos;m intuitive , or intuitively .
you might have to take a look at the same .
why does this happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , we &apos;re going to move from the third of the third of the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from the modern of the <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning of the <unk> , the <unk> .
so , you have found that you have a common language that you &apos;ve talked a common language , you can communicate it , in the same cave , or in other areas , cities , and have the <unk> <unk> , and it was kind of creating a <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , a very natural , a little bit of a living .
but you also had to learn , so not a toddler , you can talk to nature , but we &apos;re learning to <unk> and and in of course .
this is then the way they &apos;ve been going to be the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was the time of the day , because of course , the vibrant language began to <unk> in the form of writing , which means what is going to be in and alive , i &apos;ll start and <unk> it in stone and i &apos;ll see it .
depending on how i got to and when i <unk> , it &apos;s a very different story than if there is a living in a way .
but then , <unk> was then recorded this script as a <unk> , then the <unk> .
then the next generation , which we &apos;re actually living in life today .
this is the <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> and others .
it was just a <unk> , where <unk> , <unk> and others , you &apos;re actually passionate about when the people want to read , then you want to be <unk> , and that &apos;s absolutely <unk> .
and now we &apos;re coming into the next generation , and the exciting thing is , so a <unk> is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re actually in this <unk> phase that we &apos;re going to be .
and we &apos;re absolutely totally , of course , because we see on the one hand , the social media , facebook and so on .
with total transparency , what the new think is what the new thought of the <unk> , don &apos;t tell that in the <unk> <unk> , and no longer , or other phenomena , i want to do this , and i want to do it .
and these two worlds are just beginning to start thinking of , new and old .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> , very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but not the same way , but on global level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that is the theme of ecology .
not , if i think the local space , and the neighbor is less ecologically , then it doesn &apos;t work .
this is , from the local village , it has become a global village with the same principles , of course , but also transparency .
as you knew at the village , who has been who , and when , this is what this is happening today , this <unk> of our self through this movable layer of <unk> .
whether we know , we know , globally , and and always , and it &apos;s getting better .
as it used to be in the village .
so the background i &apos;ve been looking at this , which is because what is it , because of course , what is , of course , what is the difference for us , but also , instinctively , so what does the difference ?
because often , people are , can &apos;t make it <unk> , so anybody can handle it .
so you have to deal with it , because it &apos;s because it &apos;s not just that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s also to be better .
and when , of course , it &apos;s also a bit intuitively , and how can i take the influence , and the way that you make the way that you &apos;re a <unk> , so you &apos;re fun because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just to use .
you &apos;re going to go , as well as a graduate student , with the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s , of course , what you start and and say , &quot; okay , now i &apos;m going to look inside the inside of the inside itself .
and what about it ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re out there ?
and what does it mean , well , intuitively , how do our channels of the perception and how does the cognitive process ?
because steve jobs has said to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so you have to really have to look at the detail if i want to make something more or intuitive , what is called the core .
and there you already see that you &apos;re a our our seven senses , most of us think , is only seven , but it &apos;s actually seven <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly seven , the next , the <unk> sense of the , and as extension as extension .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
tell me what is information ?
information is all the difference that makes a difference .
many use of the word , knowledge , but not what it means to be very detail .
but i have to understand in the core , understanding when information becomes information , when are data going to information , when are data , i know how i can do things like that , or of course , i can do things like that , or of course .
and of course , how does design , as well as an impact of the perception .
we see this when i make things , then i can make it puzzling as the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can kind of cool it into it by making things .
so , very much natural , in a <unk> , but i see , right , where is salt and pepper in it .
and if i say someone , give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;ll think of it , where is in .
and the left just kind of , and then i &apos;m hoping that no sugar in it is to give the salt .
but also our perception of ourselves , how do they do it .
for example , this perception of the context .
the right bubble looks taller than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just as large , and yet , our perception , depending on the context of what we do .
anybody know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should be done .
there &apos;s a little bit more like my glasses .
so it &apos;s an n circle .
a second circle starts to relate to certain similarity of things .
and if i &apos;m going to add a <unk> , we don &apos;t see , and there &apos;s a unit , which circle and , but we see a unit , we &apos;re not seeing a little bit , a circle , a circle , a circle .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re called <unk> or the <unk> , which is also influenced by us in the perception .
important for the creation , which is the most of the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> , the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and in the third of the third time , you &apos;ve forgotten .
but this is an essential part of the , if you &apos;re to be able to design things so much as you know .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , which is very interesting .
sounds very banal , but it &apos;s so exciting , but it &apos;s very exciting to get closer .
so we have the eyes in front of the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see from the back to the front .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re seeing is a assumption that you can see something you can recognize , <unk> circle .
that &apos;s , we &apos;re only going to see our first time , before we see it , back back to the back of our <unk> to say , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay ,
i have this kind of cognitive cognitive system , you &apos;ve got what you &apos;re going to see what you want to see .
so , this is , then again .
and it goes back to the front of the front , because the back of the front of the front , and it &apos;s going to look at it , and you can see if you see what you see , it &apos;s what you see .
and then it goes back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so , a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much , the things that happens for the things .
i don &apos;t know who you know this image .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described to .
now , everybody is trying to see something that pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees what is .
does anybody see a particular particular ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw that once , that &apos;s a <unk> in in , you know , you know .
they &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now look at the <unk> .
and on , now , you see it always .
so , i actually have them now suggesting that they don &apos;t see any pattern of a pattern , but i have them <unk> in a very short picture , and again , you see this dog in this <unk> image .
and this is this projection projection of seeing , <unk> , see .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to see the <unk> of the world .
i see the <unk> .
so , quite exciting processes , which is then , yes , gray , it &apos;s not actually , but here in this <unk> crowd .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know , as designers .
if i know , it takes three seconds to say , to the present , i can also bridge very well as well as i &apos;m doing it , and i &apos;m going to bridge it with three seconds .
it &apos;s just to process as present .
then , it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegantly <unk> for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what do you need to milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
it &apos;s a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time that you fall in love .
so that means , if you know that , you know who you can see how long because i don &apos;t get any <unk> for what &apos;s going to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the most perceptions of most of the perceptions that we have .
so , this is the first glimpse of a rapid rate of how we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we kind of ourselves , we &apos;re looking at our environment so we can think about it .
of course , the <unk> of the <unk> don &apos;t just have to be perceptions and neural <unk> , but mostly of course , of course , with the subject of the <unk> .
so , as a human being , a human being a <unk> .
there are the practical functions , so <unk> aspects of the things .
there are <unk> , where i know exactly where i do , i have to do .
but there are also symbolic functions , why anybody for such a little <unk> , where anyway , <unk> sums of money , so <unk> money money from money , although it &apos;s not practical ?
there are more than the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we &apos;re also concerned as a designer of natural .
back to my actual subject of natural interface and the subject , which is also <unk> , is <unk> .
<unk> means always , as i can do as fast as a very close goal or how can a user users in a particular way of <unk> , effective and <unk> .
that &apos;s how it says , &quot; it &apos;s the norm .
how can i do something like this ?
i can use that directly or i need an n manual , or i need an incredibly faith .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
i do it just different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and if you just look at the software that we &apos;ve seen , it &apos;s kind of , you know , you know , why <unk> percent of our brain today is not known or not to be available to the <unk> percent of our brain today , which is already significantly more intuitive than classical software .
and this is not until apple <unk> has not been done for apple , <unk> , <unk> , if i want to make technological technologies to make the human technologies .
why ?
because in order , we &apos;re in the policy of the <unk> , so the natural user , for example , average average average at the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of classical <unk> , five hours , and with this new way of the natural software software , and with this new type of natural software .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours a little bit home , but your employer or somebody else is , how he is doing it with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a certain thing to do .
if we &apos;re in the domain of software , the first <unk> interfaces that you &apos;ve got months of the way that you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next thing that already came up with the medical limbic model , as the software <unk> says , , which is , you know , you have a idea of something that metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor to the computer .
so no more zeros and ones , or <unk> , but a metaphor .
that was the whole thing that was much more <unk> , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> is very much more related to behavior .
so , i &apos;m designing as a , a , a lot more often than the behavior than that .
so this is also a shift .
that i think that this is always <unk> for success , just the <unk> of a app .
and if i &apos;m going to step back into this natural user interfaces , where i &apos;m by voice , by the voice , by the <unk> , by the <unk> , by the power of the gesture , and not more on mouse and <unk> , and not yet to go on .
but that leads me to the point when the things are actually intuitive ?
so if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to go back and see my little friend here and see what does this mean , because of the point of view of the <unk> , when is now now a really intuitive , ?
and that &apos;s always a bit of a bit of a bit of a , when i have to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t want to think of it , but it &apos;s just making it easy .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is it .
and what does that mean for designers ?
so , if we look at that we can use existing <unk> of a different type of something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do this as a third .
so , i can put such an intuitive , human software software software , and doing the whole thing of the software .
so , of course , the question is , is actually the most <unk> of people people , and i &apos;ve already been telling .
this is what the <unk> system .
it &apos;s all using us and <unk> is an acronym and it &apos;s for trade , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it &apos;s all the power of all the time , but it &apos;s kind of <unk> , and it &apos;s kind of intuitively , or partly instinctively .
the model is already <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s the whole time that most of us knew that this model is .
<unk> <unk> is about 50 to <unk> time from us , so in the sleep , you realize that it &apos;s less often <unk> than a day .
now , i can now start to get this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and by this kind of transmission , like the metaphor of the <unk> , but not a metaphor metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher higher urban <unk> than that transmission of a classical metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m doing this , for example , i think , as a result , as a result , <unk> , the <unk> , you know , it &apos;s a big way to me , i can see it in detail , and yes , <unk> , i can &apos;t send it to you or or or you or or you and so on , and on .
then i can translate this whole .
i &apos;m going to do this a <unk> .
well , everybody has a eaten .
assuming : now , i &apos;m using the object , again , again , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the entire <unk> of the entire way , can now be able to filter this and say , show me just a moment with chocolate .
and once at a time , a piece of a , which is a much more intuitive and a lot of natural natural .
because that i can reach things like the bits of the , and they can come up to me , is much natural than when <unk> <unk> <unk> , or other kinds of problems can be able to make things .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i want to close to that one , a and again , and again , to be the reason to come to new solutions , and in that particular , i &apos;m very thankful to get you right for your attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you &apos;re going to be large , as a baby , is that you care what you &apos;re doing so , yes ? and depending on whether your parents have to play more or less , and the more , , and the more , , it &apos;s going to be in the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> , the more , , of course , your curiosity will participate .
and the curiosity isn &apos;t going to learn .
so , all of those are , and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you cannot learn .
now , i &apos;m about , basically , this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and the one of phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
they &apos;ll give you a <unk> every day , and they give you layer about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they don &apos;t have teeth .
they cannot store energy .
they cannot have bones .
we could just be as a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> .
if we did not do any phosphorus in the fact .
so amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re talking about something that would be really <unk> , but not that .
because all of you talk about energy , but nobody is talking about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we &apos;re from two countries .
we have only been in for two years , and now , now , by the world &apos;s energy , much more uranium in the environment , as in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of uranium are uranium in our fields in germany .
and we &apos;re taking all this .
it &apos;s what leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment , if we &apos;re a little bit less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , the less car .
<unk> the environment , do less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> , less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is what if i would say , your kid , just stick it every three times five times five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit less .
if we think about from the <unk> to the <unk> , our our entire earth was going to be , or later , our earth &apos;s been a <unk> .
so , the way of the <unk> to think about the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground , as the first thing .
in the ground , over <unk> percent of the <unk> .
we &apos;re building corn and <unk> between 11 and <unk> pounds of <unk> <unk> per hectare of a hectare , or in the square level .
that means we &apos;re losing about five times more than being formed .
we can just look at the <unk> of course .
and it &apos;s kind of packaging or content .
for example , in <unk> , the most of the <unk> 20 percent of the <unk> <unk> .
and because we &apos;re older , they &apos;re going to be more likely .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re in the <unk> of the <unk> .
yes ?
one baby needs about six times .
we could reduce that 10 percent , but what does that mean ?
this is a balanced of china .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we like to do with this <unk> ?
there is one of the proof that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be in the nearby of the <unk> of the <unk> .
people are about the urine .
yeah .
so , you can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is <unk> , right ?
traditionally , we think in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many of the world .
and if you have people who are the people who are <unk> , if you say that , you &apos;re better , you weren &apos;t there , then you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone says al gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing to stabilize than human citizens .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a lifetime of life , you &apos;re going to get the earth .
here , the more you say , the more you , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants would weigh more than we humans .
i could also use termites , but in america , no one in the united states , as far as they were vegetarian .
that &apos;s the ants of weigh much more than we .
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , a little bit of 30 billion people .
which is , we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we are gone , what we really wanted to do and how sad we are , we can see that we are at all on earth , you can see that , for example , is a program to be here , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one ?
meaning , that means all our intelligence is that we want to be dumber than a tree , yes ?
yes ?
no a tree is <unk> .
thankfully , yes ?
there are no <unk> of trees .
there are still six billion trees in the <unk> in the <unk> .
now , you &apos;ve heard about something from <unk> trees from the trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be dumber than a tree .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the <unk> <unk> , no longer , that our own <unk> are going to go back .
every year we &apos;re losing three million tons of phosphorus that really have to go back in the middle class .
and that &apos;s too many .
just about it .
so , we feel so much about the earth that we &apos;re saying , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , and as they all are the hot that allow us to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
it &apos;s certainly makes sense to be less harmful to be less harmful , which is the <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to try to make our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s the environment , it &apos;s the ultimate not be there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
they can only have <unk> , if they &apos;re not there .
even if you would shoot , they would have emissions .
so you cannot solve it .
we can do it differently .
we can take our nutrients back .
we do in brazil in brazil where we get rid of nutrients .
and so , we can actually <unk> nutrients in agriculture .
we do this in china for example , where we &apos;re taking the waste of it .
in china , a <unk> <unk> is still <unk> , in the way , yes ?
and in our west , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
so , the whole western peel of the world is made by that the city is always taken , but the farmer never has to have a little bit .
and by doing , cities had to grow more because the farmers went into cities and the cities had to get away their nutrients .
all the west are always expanding , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over five years because because you were always able to get the nutrients .
even today , if you were invited to the dinner , you &apos;re expected to eat that it long time to stay the restroom .
because it &apos;s <unk> , and to take the nutrients to the .
you put them to dinner , not to the <unk> .
that &apos;s , you can see the nutrients as you can get the nutrients back .
so this is actually a nice thing , if you do that , agriculture does , biogas , in one hectare of a country with five thousand people , and the facility is a farmer about <unk> dollars and the facility to get to eat the chickens and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> in the favelas is coming back over 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , to be bad .
we can support them , be good .
this is , of course , <unk> , but the plants are actually carrying themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed to design the design that a farmer can simply able to do .
so , that means that the <unk> goes back .
and none of these assets , we have built over <unk> <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these plants have ever been <unk> .
they could easily be able to get a pint of <unk> <unk> , and then the plant is being thrown over .
not happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , to be bad .
we can support them , be good .
that means we need to be <unk> .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re in germany at the best of all the treatment treatment to the <unk> treatment of all the treatment treatment is in <unk> .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> , you can do a little bit of help .
because the <unk> plant could be the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what needs to be .
we &apos;re going to see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s certainly true .
we &apos;ve been using this in holland for the three years .
the the dutch government has explain , they &apos;ll be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need this whole .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the control of the control .
and we &apos;re replacing the oil that we can use by others .
but the phosphorus is not replacing .
it &apos;s not about trying to do the existing , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and , most of all , you know what the right thing is .
that &apos;s , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , of course , because in holland , the country is established on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife &apos;s sad , if you have them , you have your your wife , and you &apos;re coming to fifty lung .
very inefficient .
but , quite effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany is eating three kilogram during their lifetime .
it &apos;s doing it .
this is not exactly what &apos;s not right because we don &apos;t know how much more <unk> is going to do .
but a <unk> , even at this light , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s effective , but it &apos;s effective .
one of the things in life is not efficient .
not the resource efficiency , but efficiency .
questions , what is the right ?
not , the <unk> can be a little bit better than burning and <unk> it and <unk> the whole of the materials for the disease , but first time , how do you do a class ?
so think of it , you know .
yes ?
if i &apos;m going to dinner for dinner , and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
great , sir ?
this is efficient .
everything in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with someone else , the same ?
yes ?
meaning , everything in life is not about saving , not to prevent , to avoid .
all the <unk> .
we tell people , well , you know , you &apos;re not green in the south .
no , that &apos;s the right thing , yes ?
in any place where you &apos;re <unk> , yes , you can get back again .
but the wrong things .
if you &apos;re the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
in the way we think of the north .
there &apos;s any footprint in the way .
if you walk , yeah , it &apos;s not the footprint , the floor .
because the ground will die off the mosses , and the the water is washing the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that &apos;s a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we &apos;re saying in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you know , with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i &apos;m going to say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust of when you see in italy like people in the high , as a <unk> coke can get out of the car , to it .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s an ideal form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please , you know .
we have a <unk> for example , which is an <unk> fluid .
they can go to where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re all over the .
and it contains seeds from rare plants that they &apos;re going to do it by the way to biodiversity .
that &apos;s , we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so , there are two loops .
not all of course , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
a television set or a washing machine , they &apos;re not just using it .
just the things that <unk> <unk> , how <unk> , how <unk> , how <unk> , how <unk> , how <unk> , they have to be so that they go into biological systems .
the things that are only deployed , go into the technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
and right , , in fact , right , , and not for the company <unk> by <unk> , but for the point that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do we do it anymore .
yes ?
so , if i &apos;m eating it for the food and say that &apos;s free of <unk> , then it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we lay in what is inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic in it .
it &apos;s all what it is in is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can get the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the rubber , you can go through the <unk> of the <unk> , yes ?
everything is <unk> .
and if we do , we can , of course , for <unk> , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s population of the world that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re doing it , and ask them to the people .
hey , <unk> , do you really really really do ?
because now , now , they have a <unk> change .
and i &apos;m not sure if they really don &apos;t get a <unk> .
so , help me a little bit of this .
but it &apos;s .
yeah .
what &apos;s just been shown .
that &apos;s going .
we can do things like that , if they &apos;re <unk> , if they &apos;re <unk> , they can have in biological spheres .
the first time is the same .
there is a direct <unk> of this .
this is the first green backpack , actually , the back is done in the circulation .
so , in any store , you can do things .
if you &apos;re coming to that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> of the that ?
so , if the moment is the waste .
all this <unk> <unk> , almost .
in the countries where people are coming to money .
so , the <unk> front of the <unk> , but otherwise in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , the way they can back to the <unk> of the , you can actually plant trees in in tunisia .
yes ?
just if you take those of those knobs , you <unk> , sterile , sterile , and the powder to plant trees .
so , the baby &apos;s <unk> for the whole life , from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , in fact .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent it .
i &apos;ve created an institute .
now , there are many people working with , and they can all engage in .
there are <unk> a club , <unk> where everybody can join .
so no longer save , avoiding , avoid , reducing , not , but intelligent waste .
do you think of it ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i &apos;m as a <unk> , so as a <unk> , in english , i understand .
<unk> are the written on the written music in music .
you don &apos;t think of the word for word word for word word for word for word text in a different language , but also , the deeper sense of the words and <unk> , it has to make a good translation , anybody who has to do with <unk> .
in the english english english english , we can &apos;t know , you know , if you &apos;re about poetry , if you &apos;re about poetry or even about poetry .
but very alien , but it &apos;s a <unk> , which we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> of a <unk> , i first , first of the written on the written .
you think that the composer in the music is exactly what he has been .
in fact , the grades are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about just as much as the right or <unk> , as a verbal verbal language , if it seems very seemingly <unk> , the description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers don &apos;t smell , the degrees of the <unk> of the <unk> cannot be hearing the <unk> of the <unk> cannot be hearing .
so , the brck has to take this <unk> data of the <unk> in another , which is <unk> , concrete , <unk> <unk> .
today , i want to give you what i mean , &quot; listen , &quot; so , <unk> , one in a verbal language language .
so basically , one translation of translation .
so i &apos;m so , i think it &apos;s not to do all of the german , because if i had to translate it in english english , it would be equivalent to translation of the translation of the translation .
so , the music works for me as much as the word spoken word .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letter of a writing .
so it &apos;s not going to be able to read , just grades , reading grades and the keys to push the keys on the piano or the right place to the the piano or the right place to the right place to the right place .
so , this is just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of letters is that you can &apos;t see the language of it .
so , you need to be for the process of music , at least as long as the word spoken word .
there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , only passive , or you can also talk to the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts similar to the <unk> of the .
so after you have to have a piece of a piece of it , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to get the way of the composition of composition .
you collect information about the piece of the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts , by the composer itself .
you study the work that he had been in and after a second .
you compare it .
the <unk> , writing it .
what , what did he feel ?
how were his life , like the society and politics ?
it &apos;s all about me .
you think of it in the time , by looking at the for example , looking at the <unk> images , and read literature .
but with the time , but as a result , you have a rich knowledge about the composer that you play more than a lot of time , and it &apos;s going to be easier to feel in him and feel .
the <unk> is always going to be more to the friend of the <unk> .
so the concerns to write the piece , it &apos;ll be more and more to my personal concerns , to play it .
now , the notes is all the way of the the cause of the human composer , but only a scaffold , and we &apos;re now doing this scaffold to make sense of purpose and meaning to the .
i &apos;m going to tell you in my own words , what between this framework .
i play a little bit of what those sounds could have .
now for me and for the composer , and what they might mean for him today .
every tone , every one of the time gets a sense of it , because i feel it myself because it comes out of my own <unk> .
it has to be in here , and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience that my urging is .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i could have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been able to experience that long long as we can see how to experience it .
as you &apos;ve been again , you have to rethink a happy new day , although with the same of the , , up , up , breakfast , to work , so i &apos;ll have the same piece of the time to the new .
i &apos;ve become a day again , seasons change , my pulse rate at the end of the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer that it &apos;s going to be coming back to your home .
i take the breathe of the audience , or consciously or unconsciously .
all of those influences me and all of it , and it &apos;s the way my experience with the composition .
and it &apos;s great , if i stand with a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing as in a good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea in and it &apos;s got to be a reaction to a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have the <unk> and what you don &apos;t have any samples .
it &apos;s a great fun to do , in this way , and you have the audience , how the music communicate .
so , every concert is a different concert .
i &apos;ll never play more like that moment .
i can &apos;t play today like in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today and i &apos;m going to be on my own palette of the <unk> of the <unk> of emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> , but it &apos;s new <unk> .
i have a nice example of this .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> at my beloved teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a known <unk> , <unk> , <unk> professor , and a professor professor of the <unk> of the <unk> here in <unk> .
sadly , i was too much too young to be , so he was <unk> when i finally started studying study .
but i had the great lucky , it was very early , and i was to meet with 13 years , and i was at my school at my school .
i was 17 than i went back on one of his class class , and played the last four of the four of the <unk> , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was .
so this is a part of the part .
and in my graduate school , i said , expectation .
and he said , &quot; well ?
it has to be the <unk> .
because for me , she does .
he was over a <unk> .
well , with 17 times you have dreams , but not a major memories .
i play this piece of a few years and i &apos;ve got it , and it &apos;s been turned to me , although i &apos;ve changed , although not only has changed .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because i read something new .
an example of a different area , a very different area , a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , at the <unk> light .
he has the <unk> <unk> , as he saw it , as he saw it , as you saw it , as you saw it at that moment .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of the piece is that comparable .
now , i &apos;ve been as as a <unk> , as a radio , when he wrote the piece of the piece .
he has been living for a <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to me , and i think it &apos;s important to look at the grades , even though i mean , you can communicate .
to hold <unk> , directly with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you begin to talk to the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to be about just as long as the word for spoken word for spoken word .
often , the most of the most of the most , is that you can &apos;t learn the grades .
you &apos;re basically teaching you first before you &apos;re just talking a word .
you learn to find sound sound to the music .
if all your fingers and right as it says , in the notes , they &apos;re going to come to the sound of the sound that sounds like music .
if that happens , the student gets the <unk> piece .
so , about interpretation , hardly , you know , you know , about the <unk> .
all right , there &apos;s the front door , this is a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and b , etc .
that &apos;s most of the most here .
but also , if you put this data , it still stays there .
and yet , it &apos;s always no interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often have a very <unk> of <unk> .
namely , that , to make music on the instrument , to do your musical , and you should be there before .
which is the singing .
a kid who didn &apos;t learn the singing because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it won &apos;t do it .
this is like the <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experience and idea of the music , then it &apos;s about a more way to make it , so much about an instrument , to sound .
people who never had singing , they never felt directly with your own body , like it is to form a sound .
one of the things that i think of his own breath .
the instrument of music is the extension of our bodies .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> in the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> is not <unk> today with music .
you don &apos;t need to do more for yourself , if it &apos;s a boring .
no longer needed to whistle a <unk> whistle .
every your own music will be <unk> , if you &apos;re going to be <unk> from the outside .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
i &apos;m not going to do that , you can &apos;t sing , a , because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
and in both , it &apos;s not too late to see if they can &apos;t , whether they can &apos;t , or to learn how to do these little muscles that the vocal chords , right .
and that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you have it <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
i &apos;m a question of how <unk> competent , was that diagnosed ?
have you got a <unk> or <unk> , how do you tell it beautiful ?
or d , they don &apos;t like any music , and you don &apos;t want to be doing it for it .
but what i would do is , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , so you can see , all cases , nobody has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t you say , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m , but sure , you can say whether it like you don &apos;t like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , &quot; somebody says , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of the food , because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get them on classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously , and tell you whether it tastes them or not .
whether the music is to you or too cute .
tell what they feel .
and with the time , they also want to be able to make , and want to make some more spices of <unk> , or taste even fine differences .
now why am i asking my audience that it &apos;s also actively listening ?
because the music is a language , and a language is a language to communicate .
a piece of artwork that you never look at , no force to work .
the food that was cooked by a chef or a cook <unk> , has to be eaten , and not only looked at the <unk> .
so , listen to if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment where the adults are doing the music , or at least , the music of the music , a child , then , it &apos;s easy for a <unk> , to ask , what color does your flower ?
can you also play in blue ?
and the kid playing , after a <unk> , , instead of a red flower , a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
so this was the first one of the very first term .
so the first step of a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of this , this is a little bit of a hundred ago ago , before <unk> , or three ago ago , three hundred years ago .
now , the instruments have been <unk> .
there was a time of time as an instrument , and not the piano .
it was just not invented .
i think that the bach would have been excited when he had the <unk> possibilities of the modern of modern <unk> .
i can actually have the <unk> that the bach had taken on the modern wing , which is a <unk> <unk> .
also , you know , he heard more than he was deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is a orchestra &apos;s been rejected as a <unk> .
so , the composers rely on us rely on us to reinvent the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be <unk> , which they just thought of it in the mind .
and also , what you would think in the spirit of the mind .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what envy is envy ?
were you ?
and how did this feel ?
suck .
i have a friend , who drives a <unk> .
so if i come to my little <unk> w , and i &apos;m going to get the next point , it comes to me .
i &apos;m going to take a little bit through the head .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; <unk> , what needs you like this , n car ?
it &apos;s already losing half of the value in the first year .
and at all , you work much less than i .
why do i afford to do this n little car ?
and then i &apos;m going to have a , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and i say the word justice , is this an awkward feeling .
our organism invented a great way to get such as uncomfortable as the envy of the envy are simply to get away .
you can also try and be revenge or something like that .
i want to explain to you today , something that you &apos;re probably familiar with , which is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lying , as you may say you may have heard of , if people say no one has a wall to the .
and then they <unk> , so he <unk> the perspective of the .
on a lie , you see that the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check that it &apos;s very much in the sense .
it &apos;s just does not make it , and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , who has to do with that , that they &apos;re themselves .
they need this one in order to get a <unk> to get a <unk> .
they can easily easily easily easily , , yes , <unk> or the bottom .
they need time .
from that time , one anecdote , you may know .
the spanish painter <unk> <unk> , once again , a woman .
this woman complained that , the portrait didn &apos;t see her similar .
picasso says , wait for it .
it &apos;s always more similar .
and if you laugh , you know how important that lie is that one is the lie of the lie , and how much time you need to take care of what artists can do a very well .
because artist artist has a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artist &apos;s shared with you , and particularly this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if they just look at the mirror .
the artist is shared with you in a portrait of something that you &apos;re not familiar with , if you look at this piece of this piece of this piece of art .
then this uncomfortable feeling , it couldn &apos;t look like you , and it &apos;s going to be more similar .
here , you have this mechanism that we can use the lie of a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in the art , even in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories , it turns back .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked at the mirror every morning , and he asked him , who is the beautiful in all the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you know how much hostility from this true <unk> , the mirror cannot lie , from this true knowledge .
but we should just do that very familiar with that , you cannot say that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing to understand the , and it &apos;s necessary to be able to rebuild the <unk> .
we need this one that is that one that &apos;s <unk> , the deception , we can &apos;t survive .
we have not just in the art , in the <unk> , but in science , it &apos;s great lie .
and there is this story of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
she heard from this book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of the human .
that man should <unk> , and , yes , there were least a common ancestry between people and apes .
and then she ran her to her husband , and he said that , that &apos;s probably not true , what charles is writing .
the man is to be the monkey <unk> or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we have to stop that people are getting to understand that .
why do we have to stop that people have understand from something that is true ?
because we cannot live in the world without those <unk> .
because we &apos;re this self-deception , this sense of being great , from the highest creature , not from such a <unk> , of such a organism that exists in a stone , and it &apos;s what it &apos;s like to be a stone for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear those things .
we have to stop that people are all knowledge of things , especially when they are true .
so you see how slowly this mechanism moves around and the traces that he leaves the traces that he &apos;s leaving on something else in the great image of ourselves , i want to give you a more story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from the school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her about a student .
a 16-year-old student .
she may love him to be , because it has a <unk> to the eighth .
and she asked him , what are your fault ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the department department .
and because i &apos;m at the department department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you feel it , if you &apos;re <unk> in this position , there &apos;s something not true .
i told my wife , whenever a man in a moral <unk> is the <unk> because of the time , we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
do it once and then you know the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the department department , i &apos;m interested in doing things .
you feel that that &apos;s the truth behind the table .
so a little <unk> , which is not interested in the <unk> .
the interest of the <unk> .
but there are no <unk> , where we can see , where you can learn how to do the fire .
there &apos;s only the second second second second , the fire department .
he was called .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t say , you don &apos;t say , you don &apos;t like to get rid of fire somewhere and get to the fire after the fire after the .
no , it looks just much better than we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dangers that can be able to make the way that they &apos;re going to lay fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
and this is this <unk> that in the <unk> of the <unk> , that it actually knew about the fire , but that he can &apos;t tell it .
here , you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious ones that you immediately can do , without any you can do it , and the things you know that they can &apos;t be much different for them and others .
so , just like those words that we also use in the language of the political talk .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know if we &apos;re that , the social level are very sensitive to the .
we can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s impossible , those things in a society that should work to present .
so i want to tell you what we &apos;ve been found in my institute .
and what logic is this deception , that self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than the , we actually know that it &apos;s valid to disseminate out of the outside .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples of that .
the first example of what many of you are familiar with , and some of them are very few of them , very few of them are not going to be .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so <unk> , says , about the <unk> .
it &apos;s something that is not about stop , nature &apos;s most important .
and if you have people who have the most strong belief that they have a soul , or you can say , they think they have been hijacked by the soul of the soul , then you know , the soul , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , dead .
and from that soul , you think , in this nature , in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , it &apos;s called the latin america , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and if this is the <unk> of the people , then he &apos;s filled with the spirit of nature , with nature , that can only live , yes with a soul .
and then he can just <unk> .
so this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to get from the outside to people .
so we should be a kind of thing to be , as a matter of what &apos;s necessarily going to be for our lives .
and if you have these <unk> eyes , you understand the logic that we &apos;re going to experience this happiness in a lie .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
<unk> are familiar with the school .
now , this is a <unk> that &apos;s a logic that &apos;s called a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need something logic , but also the willingness to lie .
which is that they can just be wrong with this logic .
in this <unk> , three sentences are coming .
the first one is , <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now , there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;m particularly drawn to him .
a third sentence that immediately happens to people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
the people who don &apos;t have a soul , who is dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and here &apos;s it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk , the expression .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical .
i can say , i can say .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about the reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , then the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , then the isn &apos;t a man .
the logic does not matter what is happening .
i can say anything .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so if <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our consciousness is immediately , immediately , you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that is nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what the opposite of the first sentence has been recognized and provided it .
because actually , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , which it just is that two sentences are logical , and a third <unk> that looks like it , and it &apos;s a little bit of doing it , we can save our <unk> .
so , we do , as if it &apos;s actually impossible to be able to live a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can keep these things from different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the time , which is always going to get the <unk> .
this is another more <unk> theme , a <unk> of philosophy of philosophy .
so , this is what we &apos;re going back into the <unk> century .
there was a <unk> , which was johannes <unk> , and after that , the <unk> <unk> named the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that &apos;s inherently nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you place the exact middle between two <unk> of the <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a <unk> he should first walk .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the <unk> are introduced .
<unk> forces : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s nothing at all .
only if you put another example , so if you &apos;re going to get a a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason and not anything .
automatically , he &apos;s going to start with the right idea .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re driven by nature , it &apos;s driven by the larger crowd that you immediately wear , then they have the feeling that there &apos;s something like a free will .
and if we already are in <unk> , i remember the <unk> of brain brain .
there is a <unk> , which is called a wolf , and by him , you say , wolf says , &quot; there are no <unk> .
now we can turn back to the second sentence and can say if a wolf is right , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read about daily daily daily , you can find this third sentence .
it &apos;s about that , who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , cannot be able to be able to be able to guide for its actions and <unk> for the responsibility , and it &apos;s therefore <unk> .
again , they have it again .
actually , you have to show you whether it &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this , as if the first sentence of the time was wrong than it would be , of course , the opposite is no argument .
and now , you can just do something if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to get people happy , that guts to lie to lie .
practice for example , if you &apos;re the people who can then tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
you cannot call it , that would be a little bit of a political <unk> .
tell , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;ll have one , for granted , of course , you know , you know , you can &apos;t prove it .
and you have a problem .
because as they &apos;re busy busy , they &apos;re concerned that they cannot prove that they cannot prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he has a <unk> , which he doesn &apos;t have it on .
because actually , this is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in this , and we have a <unk> , to be proving that there are <unk> .
so , in the way of the root system , you see the brilliance of the lie .
and if you have a way of being able to feel these <unk> , people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to be happy , if they don &apos;t remember their <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good day .
i &apos;m allowed to ask myself to be able to say , &quot; i &apos;m able to say it .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this magnificent event , and i asked me if i want to give you a lecture , and my idea of my idea .
i have to say honestly , you know , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , i fell to the first time of my idea .
and i may not be able to imagine my favorite idea that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but it &apos;s natural , of course , all of many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one , the two nice girls , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s been made for this bad distorted image , because i &apos;ve been trained to study <unk> , and i think , i think , &quot; i think , &quot; i think .
and then , &quot; the <unk> of the <unk> years after berlin , because i wanted to make renewables , and that was not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
they were all the <unk> , the <unk> was <unk> .
the hot ones today .
because a good engineer has been built a great car , or <unk> .
but that &apos;s how it <unk> like crazy <unk> , from a kind of a hundred watts from the square meter , which was a toy .
and in a berlin , it was a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful grateful that he &apos;s got the word again again because after the biafran , you didn &apos;t know the word out of the word , because everything left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the <unk> years .
there was the fact that there were <unk> <unk> , and one of them sitting in <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , where you thought evil .
and the <unk> , but this was called <unk> , and wind and the main thing was done , and i started out the middle of the 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what i said today , it &apos;s been very much , because many , many beautiful expressions of the , i &apos;ve been through through through through through through through through .
i &apos;ve worked in the collective years , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one said , if one said , was the <unk> , which has a completely <unk> , i &apos;ve got a hard time i &apos;ve got to see if i &apos;m a great <unk> of the <unk> , because all my colleagues &apos; friends have been <unk> , you have the money to the windows to your child .
it &apos;s busy with the <unk> .
and this was really very , very <unk> , and you get into this , and you get into this room , just showed up a picture of where i asked me for 10 years , a thousand <unk> , and then , in the collective , , if it &apos;s really the great thing .
and i got it up to <unk> <unk> , and then we have a <unk> of the company , and then we had become <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of one of the largest <unk> of the world .
a <unk> , but we have the problem of a growing company , and we have <unk> , a little group , decided that we &apos;re going to start and go back and and go back next to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to do .
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of my presentation was , yes , as you get to a hundred percent of the .
and we just have just a relatively <unk> history of questions , where you could make a memory of a memory .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> .
yes , this is the data .
there &apos;s a half thousand people .
they have an renewables of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just technological .
if you get more <unk> , the system starts to fail .
i also tell that , always , if they &apos;re in <unk> our facility .
they always say why ?
we have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our network is the same , the european .
if we had 20 percent , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , the fact that was the <unk> , the first <unk> of the island , we &apos;re going to calculate the first <unk> of the island , but just through .
how big , because it &apos;s actually a battery , so you &apos;re like an island to 20 , <unk> , 40 , <unk> , <unk> , maybe even more aging .
and yes , i &apos;ll go back a further loop .
the conventional system is all over the world .
by the way , a hundred <unk> <unk> uses electrical performance on the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of the production of a hundred power power , because it &apos;s pretty fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s <unk> of the world , it &apos;s going to be <unk> with diesel because you don &apos;t need it .
that &apos;s going fast .
you put this box .
and then it looks like this .
in the course , three of the <unk> , two will always waited .
yeah , this is a load down there .
we have very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> , or whatever it is , is in the rule of a system , a system , which is just in small quantities of the .
our goal was just to say , okay , okay .
the diesel will <unk> and the wind , the the burden of the burden , the burden of the load of the larger part .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent of renewables , so energy per year , not the performance of the moment , you have to turn off the diesel .
so , in the moment , you have to make that renewables can take the whole network .
you can only do that , of course , if you &apos;re going to be there in some way , there are <unk> .
that &apos;s no one in the world .
so , there &apos;s the little style , so you can also use your <unk> of a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what do you actually do in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what it &apos;s going on .
but if you want to have multiple of these <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to build a network , then it &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 90 percent of the renewables and then remains here , the last 10 , the last 10 , 20 percent of renewables , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re doing that out of the batteries .
it will be a commodity case in any case , which is then , hydrogen , <unk> , power , power to gas , or <unk> , that will be .
they have to go to a <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then , have a whole bunch of simulation .
and the wind and sun and the load of <unk> and came to the outcome , a very exciting thing that you can &apos;t take a <unk> system , which is required to <unk> a middle of about 50 cents per <unk> per <unk> per <unk> .
this was the very first ones about six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay .
so , yes , we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper to <unk> , if the average five percent per year .
and then we started negotiate with the <unk> .
what would have to be done ?
with investors , i have to have a new <unk> of <unk> .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society again .
and here again , the plot .
the brown is , as a result , the conventional system , green is our system .
that our system has a <unk> , because we &apos;re doing 20 percent accuracy with diesel and also a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> , which is the <unk> on the island , which is that we find very great .
and we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technological problem .
and therefore , we decided to build a hall in the way we can actually map the electrical level of the island to three .
that &apos;s , we have to have the world &apos;s largest battery .
here &apos;s it .
and it &apos;s naturally in asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> is it in the 1970s , and then it was <unk> , and then became the <unk> of the japanese .
you can see it , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatt performance , and can take six hours of doing this power , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re sort of <unk> .
and then they set up .
we also have one of those <unk> in the same size of the way it &apos;s been there , and actually the whole dynamic behavior of this grid , so in the end of the , here &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the whole thing we simulate the rete .
here we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to sort of the <unk> of the grid in the grid .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the rete .
here we see this again again again , again , again , all the one , single <unk> .
and what we did , since the <unk> was done , until now , it was basically what the individual system of electronics was to develop software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define as a company that is just between the theme and the theme of the grid , and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , you have to communicate to the web , and it &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is on the theme that you can actually , in this island , is all the <unk> of problems that we &apos;re going to get if we &apos;re going to increase our energies .
so this whole discussion is how it &apos;s going to go back and <unk> , <unk> , how to go , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , <unk> , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> is then <unk> .
so , <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start to integrate the island of being able to integrate , <unk> , , you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re in 70 percent , you won &apos;t do that without any memory .
you can <unk> through n <unk> , you can do it by you , you know , you can &apos;t do it in any case , but you will never get rid of memory .
and this is the n of the message .
so , many people are looking at this because you can see what the problems you can get .
if we turn off the diesel , you have no more that sort of a <unk> mass , which is a kind of inertia in the grid .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically taken from <unk> <unk> masses of large <unk> of large <unk> wherever all the wave across all over europe .
we &apos;re looking at this grid , you see the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s going to make nine <unk> , we start a few <unk> , then again , again , we &apos;ll get back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly <unk> .
if you go into that somewhere , it takes it for a while .
the <unk> reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can respond to other other .
if you don &apos;t have that , this rotating crowd , then you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> , with this big battery , two milliseconds .
you know , there &apos;s the enormous amount of money there .
and the message is , we have to get to this rotating mass , if we &apos;re in a way of our goals 20 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 30 , 30 percent , and so on if we want to reach out of the time , we want to do the most of the time .
then we have to break our <unk> capacity on the rete .
<unk> is just the power station , and the power station goes to the frequency .
yeah , this is a <unk> moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t know , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not .
and we just try to make the capacity that <unk> the capacity , <unk> , by producing electrochemical <unk> into the grid .
and there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now .
and to that point people are always looking and and look at our <unk> , like our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you make a piece of a a little bit of a future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years was similar to the argument that i had in the last 30 years .
not , there &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;re all <unk> , never .
we have <unk> <unk> <unk> in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i just just go from that we &apos;re going to have the same capacity of <unk> in the next 30 years .
just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s so a whole lot of <unk> and argument .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve been experienced in the last two years that the scientists are looking at my site .
we have now got over 10 million dollars now , and also , to <unk> <unk> <unk> to the german grid .
this will be in the next april of april .
so , you know , there &apos;s a change that is there , and it &apos;s just from this <unk> to the idea , a hundred percent of the great is true .
and if you have a hundred percent , then it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in discussion , they &apos;re trying to do this <unk> , which are doing , they have a little net , that has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is , just if you &apos;re going to get out of any fossil or <unk> <unk> , who are going to be <unk> somewhere in the world , and they &apos;re an island .
then they use that what &apos;s going on sun and wind there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> power , and i &apos;m grateful grateful that they &apos;re told , the main use .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in fact , the talk of <unk> <unk> is that you can be a collective , and the energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and i just want to encourage you , you know , i want to encourage you to be a little bit , you can be a little bit crazy , and you can also have a vision .
and you have to really have a really <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the <unk> of the los angeles times , one day , a day , by the streets at los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who was on a violin , which only had two strings .
many of you are going to know the story , because of <unk> article was a book about this , which was <unk> <unk> junior , and jamie <unk> as a ferocious lopez , <unk> <unk> as a ferocious lopez , the <unk> , who had been completed by his <unk> &apos;s career .
nathaniel left , <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of <unk> row at the streets of <unk> row at the center of <unk> row .
i recommend to read the book book , or you can see the film , so you &apos;re not only to understand the marvelous connection that between these two men men , but how they actually created the instrument , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
i met mr. <unk> in the years ago , two years ago , in the walt disney of <unk> hall .
he had just a show of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and i came behind the stage to imagine .
he spoke in a very <unk> and <unk> clay on yo-yo <unk> and hillary clinton and how the dodgers never create in the baseball world of the first violin , the last sentence of the first violin of the last sentence .
we came to the theme of music , and a few days later , i got an email that nathaniel for me , was interested in me .
i have to say that nathaniel had a medical treatment , because it was already with electrical power and <unk> and <unk> <unk> , a trauma that has been chasing his whole life .
so , as a consequence , he &apos;s particularly susceptible to those schizophrenics , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and it would be <unk> for days , and the <unk> of the <unk> row , and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in fact , a <unk> , nathaniel , when we first grade class in the walt disney of the throne of <unk> hall began to have this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and didn &apos;t have lost .
he spoke over invisible demons and smoke and how he wanted him to poison him in sleep .
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could be able to put him on a relationship and <unk> and <unk> and other kinds of exciting forms of <unk> <unk> .
so i just started playing on .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s .
and as i played , i noticed that in <unk> eyes , a total shift in <unk> eyes .
it was , as if he was a invisible drug , a chemical reaction , which was catalyst for the game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and a half .
and how through a miracle he took his violin and began to play some clips of <unk> and asked me to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then started talking about music , starting by bach <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have a <unk> knowledge of music , but it was also a tight personal relationship with her .
he spoke about her with a passion and a understanding that i just know , i was just in my fellow <unk> of my fellow in the <unk> of los angeles .
by doing music , and i spoke about music , was from this <unk> , confused man who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means music .
because the music allows him to think of his thoughts and ambiguity with its imagination and to give creativity into something .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
and this is why we make music : we &apos;re doing something that is in all of us in all of us , deep , our emotions , through our own visual lens , through our own , our culture , through our culture .
and the reality that expression is all of us , and moving , inspired and we &apos;re doing it .
what bradley looks , so , it brought the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of the music was brought back to a family of musicians who got him to understand him , and it was <unk> .
and i &apos;ll keep playing with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney <unk> hall , or at <unk> row , because he reminds me why i &apos;ve become musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole the <unk> of the stolen stolen .
i hope you &apos;re pardon me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this one , this was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was in <unk> after the soviet standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that you could be able to sell it .
i had a relationship with this one of a few months .
one day the leader of the company , and i asked if i could talk at an event , about sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this particular problem for our chefs are , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been able to shrink the ocean as we forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they have collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , i think , or evil , <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
so many of the argument is , <unk> pollute the environment , most of them are comfortable , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that &apos;s , 15 pounds of <unk> , you need to get a <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to encourage you .
the day before the event , i called the head of the <unk> of the company .
let &apos;s call it .
&quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; just to just get the facts right , you &apos;re famous for being able to grow so far out in the sea , that you don &apos;t get it . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish are distributed to our fish , not being concentrated . &quot;
and then he put it , &quot; we &apos;re essentially a world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> one thing ? what feeds her ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put on .
and at that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what &apos;s a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don , what for example , sustainable protein ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;ll be a .
now , i &apos;m <unk> with a few people in the company , no one could give me an answer to me , until i finally , to finally , to the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call it <unk> .
&quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable protein ? &quot;
now he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your car is chicken is chicken ? &quot;
in fact , two percent .
now , this is about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t worry , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get off of this fish .
no , not , because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
i &apos;m even .
no , i actually have <unk> of this fish because , i swear to god , the fish after that conversation .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love love .
it &apos;s the romantic species , the way you can do , the better you learn to the fish , you know , the fish the fish .
i first ate it in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> .
he came up with a bright , almost color color color .
the <unk> had him .
stop twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can be a fish so good , after it was <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he &apos;s not cooked the fish , and he &apos;s not a cook , at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist called <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the .
it &apos;s near the top of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they &apos;re growing up in the , which is essentially the wetlands .
they did this by putting the land of the country .
they built this complicated episode of channels and they put it out of the land and out of the river , and out of the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it , that it didn &apos;t make economic .
and the green was a catastrophe .
it was about 90 percent of the birds to see what are a lot of birds for this place .
and this is in 1982 , in a spanish , <unk> , the country .
what do they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally have the lever of the lever .
instead of the water they used the canals to get the water back again .
they <unk> the canals .
they created a $ $ 2,000 hectares of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and in the process , <unk> and its company , the green destruction completely .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they &apos;re looking at the root of the , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and these density , green march .
i was not a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile for the kiss . &quot;
okay ? so , we were and <unk> ourselves through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> to my knees , and <unk> hold in quiet .
here he did a rare <unk> .
now he said the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here , here , he sees a pattern of concentrate pattern that &apos;s reminiscent of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has been the largest part of his career in the national park in africa .
i asked him how he had become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and <unk> in more <unk> of clouds and algae and <unk> .
and don &apos;t you understand me that really fascinating , you know , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , the way in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became a little bit of a <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i &apos;m cut him . i said , &quot; whoa , how do it get , it &apos;s the dog &apos;s worth so good ? &quot;
he showed up on the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the powerful , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish eating ?
what is the <unk> ? &quot;
now he goes on telling me that this is a very large system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard from a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
i was going on the day , i was going on this site with <unk> , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; how any farm , i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you do success ? &quot;
at the moment it was a director of a <unk> service .
and we released the corner and we offered the most incredible sight of the most amazing , thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally dramatic carpet so far as the eye .
&quot; this is success , he said .
&quot; look your <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; whoa , don &apos;t you know the fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now last year , on this site had 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest one of the most important public health organization in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last one you want to have to have a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not very much .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the outside the room the system the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that is rooted in the health of their illumination of their illumination .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> of the world should not be there .
they &apos;re in a city of 240 miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning they fly a hundred miles to the farm .
and every night they fly a hundred miles back .
they do this because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had a kind of trip to me , so i looked at the <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly to the farm , and fly it to a hundred thousand miles back at the night ?
do it do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , as if i had a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do this because the food is . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know the skin of my beloved fish , the delicious , and i don &apos;t like a <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i &apos;ll never play .
and yet , when i put them in this restaurant in <unk> , they didn &apos;t actually put it on the <unk> .
she liked it cute and pure than you would take a bite bite off the ocean .
i mentioned this to the <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin is like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last one , before something into the body .
it has evolved in the course of evolution , and it &apos;s the <unk> . &quot;
and then he put it , &quot; but our water is not <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that is the success of their predators .
and then i realized when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he &apos;s got enormous , because the water that comes through this farm , comes from the river .
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s all the things that are rivers are now tend to lead to lead , chemical pollutants , <unk> from <unk> .
and if it &apos;s been fighting by the system , and this leaves is the water as it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only a farm that has the success of their predators , but a farm that literally is a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water is <unk> , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should do it , because this love love , how romantic is , as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic as
you could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one of the food in the foods .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit to radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about regional food . we &apos;re eating .
and if you claim that those are the things that the future good foods is somebody somewhere , and says , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not , because we &apos;re already enough to produce enough calories to feed the world more than only .
a billion people are going to die today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than than than ever before -- because of <unk> inequities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;re the logic of our <unk> over the last 50 years .
feeding crops on herbivores , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken roads , and all the time they were getting more cheap , how awful , it can be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the <unk> plan of america .
we should call them what it is , a craft in <unk> , a craft , which is rapidly <unk> capital that allows the to make this production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not farming .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> , but because of <unk> resources , but because of <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through fertile land , not by pumps , but through fresh water , but through the forests , but through fish , but through fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are allowed to to feed any community themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> of the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in the <unk> and it never made a good food .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that , that &apos;s on two billion years of <unk> .
look at the <unk> of farmers like <unk> , like <unk> .
businesses , not worlds , they are in companies , the <unk> of <unk> , businesses , the <unk> of the <unk> , rather than only being , but experts are responsible for relationships .
because they are the ones who are experts are .
and if i really am , if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better cook than i &apos;ll be .
you know , that &apos;s me right , because if the future is good , it &apos;s delicious .
thank you .
if i want to show you one thing about it , it &apos;s the sum of the data that we consume , bigger than the sum of your parts and rather than to think about how we can use information that you can &apos;t see how we can &apos;t see information .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter a number of death of death , we say accidents .
and i think , i think , a different pattern that makes it .
and it &apos;s because in the most of the most , people are the most active and they are the most of the most .
we can go out a step further , and line up the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now if we &apos;re going to go further and more and more , and we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are actually the key to people to worry about people .
and who <unk> is that is true in men .
so , you realize that this is the data of information and data in this very way in the <unk> of the <unk> .
and if we can do this for data for data , why not for the content itself ?
what we &apos;re here are the <unk> of every single &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can actually test it to my dorm room in their dorm rooms .
with <unk> , you can actually be in a decade .
you can actually join in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
so if i look here , i &apos;m the athletes that comes in this room and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong , so i click this way , i &apos;ll see here , and i &apos;ll show you all the way on the <unk> of the <unk> armstrong .
now , if i want to have a <unk> of a <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all the stuff about the subject ? &quot;
so i go back to step back and <unk> the perspective .
now i &apos;m seeing greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you can find on this kind of information , <unk> , taller , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t want to look or not just .
you do something that is actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to do a little bit further about what a little crazy thing is .
what we did here is we took every single <unk> and it &apos;s down to a little summary .
so the summary is a quick review and a symbol for the realm of it .
i just show the top 500 of the popular <unk> .
but even in this particular case , we can do a lot of things .
now , we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of the government .
well , after i chose , i know that the <unk> , which is most of the most <unk> people in the year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
this is just to see if you go back and look at the whole step , and it &apos;s looking at all .
so , a particular thing to a particular summaries , i can go back to time time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and everybody together .
now , if i look at all those people , i realize that majority of them are <unk> , some of the ones are coming from science . some of the , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all ted prize winner .
you can see , we &apos;re surfing on the web as a matter of the , it &apos;s not just a web , not just from side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i don &apos;t want to call a browser ; it &apos;s really not browser , but you can see sites that -- and we put this <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back a step , and just to a specific <unk> of the jump .
so that &apos;s why you just look at from those sites of planets in this way , and the whole of the <unk> in the same way of looking at the same way .
so i can zoom in my course of a particular place .
here &apos;s the one of the big one i thought to this .
and i can kind of , as i &apos;ve been looking at all of the things i &apos;ve been looking at today .
and if i take a step back and look at all , i can also rethink my trajectory , and i &apos;m looking for the <unk> &apos; s , or here after live , or a live <unk> .
and from here i can get into the site and you &apos;re going to go back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it does it the big picture than the sum of the <unk> .
right now in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking from drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and turn the internet upside down , so that we instead of going to go from one to the other , we can start to see many things and by the way that otherwise hidden hidden are hidden ?
if we can do this , then this past , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of that .
and if we know , we can actually start to pull off the <unk> .
i &apos;m going to say , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
in my school school , i went to school every day every hour .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , which <unk> my thoughts in other worlds and in <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and this curiosity also showed that i always , if i didn &apos;t in the school , traveling through the forests of the forest , and we see , &quot; samples , &quot; <unk> , frogs and <unk> and beetle and <unk> and <unk> and the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the kinds of possible .
and my love of science fiction seems to be in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and they were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that we were looking at animals and places and a world full of miracles that we never could imagine before .
and that &apos;s probably the very good thing to this <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could able to draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no video games that <unk> these <unk> with <unk> , even the whole images in the environment , i had to create the pictures inside my head .
we had all that time when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and they &apos;re growing up on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was what i was drawing and paint from alien , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all the way .
in the <unk> , i was the most of the teachers , like i , in the textbook , <unk> .
the creativity had to be out .
and what happened is something interesting . what was interesting about jacques cousteau shows of the world &apos;s thought of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
certainly i would never get a extraterrestrial world with a spaceship , which was pretty unlikely .
but here was a world which i actually could come back here on earth , and it was equally fascinating and exotic like all of which i &apos;ve been doing to tell me when i had these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to get a diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , a thousand miles from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me get a <unk> of this .
i &apos;m <unk> my dad , until he finally got a <unk> in buffalo , new york , and i had done , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i did my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> in the middle of buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i first got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , the last few days , i &apos;ve been spending about 2,000 hours of water . 500 hours of it .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , as rich as we can actually imagine .
the idea of nature doesn &apos;t know , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
to the day of the day , i have a deep awe for what i see on my way .
and my love to the ocean keeps the the ocean , the same way ever .
so when i was an adult a a profession , it was the filmmaking .
so that seemed the best way to tell my inner drive to tell stories , with my need to build pictures of the , to unite .
as a kid , i drew the comic books and so .
so , the scenes of the way , images and stories , and this fit together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m <unk> from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could bring my preference for the <unk> and the diving .
so , in fact , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; to solve a problem of a problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we &apos;re attacking it on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what happens to the end , the first <unk> <unk> that ever had to see in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t have a money , exactly what he was doing was a little bit , but i realized that the audience all over the world was <unk> off the magic that went off .
the <unk> of arthur eliot are known to be <unk> technology and magic to <unk> .
so they saw something magical .
and i thought that i thought incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s what has to be in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot of .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was the way of the way that effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had something magical , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money on the film .
from those two experiences , we can start to start , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , with my good friend , stan winston , who was at that time the best <unk> and <unk> was , &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
so the idea of this company was to start using visual currents with visual printers and the same to the same to the same to the same to the same .
we did that , and we did a <unk> of a <unk> .
but the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we actually created in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we actually created the company -- too slow .
i had written this piece of avatar , which is the the <unk> of the visual effects and <unk> effects in new terms of the <unk> of human , dense characters that have been created by <unk> , and the <unk> should be <unk> .
but the bar hit quite a nice back , and the people in my company told me that we couldn &apos;t be able to do that .
so i shifted this , and i did this other film about the big ship , the end .
the <unk> i did this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it became an <unk> of magnitude , a passionate film .
but the first thing i wanted to actually do was actually the real <unk> of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
i have them convinced , but i said , &quot; we &apos;re coming up to the <unk> , we film the real <unk> .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
it &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good good job for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to finance an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is back back to that , that the imagination can create a reality .
and then we actually created a reality that i put in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles below the surface of the north , and the real star through a <unk> .
this was not a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , this blew my mind .
and the preparation of preparation was enormous . we had to get up cameras and light and all kinds of things .
and i noticed , like , how much of those <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> planning .
you get into this capsule , you put into this dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is in rescue , if you &apos;re not going back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same as i &apos;m in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was very obsessed with the deep sea of the deep sea .
anyway , at least of the part of the piece of curiosity and science , it was all . it was an adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood can &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a nature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the outside of the earth .
in some of the next expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before before , sometimes , that nobody had ever seen before , and for the science that didn &apos;t have before before we saw them , and the science at the moment when we saw them , not had no words .
so that &apos;s what i got right , and i wanted to do more .
and i did a a a little unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood to hollywood , and i &apos;ll be <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we began to go to &quot; <unk> , &quot; and they explored with <unk> .
we went back to the wreckage of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which is a <unk> <unk> .
our purpose was , <unk> and the the inner of the ship , what has never been done before .
nobody ever had the internal of the <unk> of the <unk> , you didn &apos;t have a means to it , so we developed the way to technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see the <unk> that these <unk> are quite like the <unk> , and i know that once i know that the band has played there .
and i fly with a little <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the ship .
but i &apos;m just doing it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i would be physically at the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the most reliable form of a <unk> that i ever experienced , because before i had a <unk> , i knew what was the same in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was going to be able to see the film .
and the set of this set was an exact copy of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
and she made me realize that <unk> <unk> , that you use such <unk> <unk> , and so your awareness into the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little bit of a look at what might happen in a few decades , which might happen in a few decades , if you have to study something to explore or to do some of the things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> , i can imagine as a <unk> .
so after that expeditions , we began to really appreciate what we had seen down , really appreciate , for example , that <unk> , where we saw these amazingly amazing animals . that &apos;s kind of alien , but here on earth .
they &apos;re living with the help of the <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in one of the sunlight , the way we do .
and so you can see animals that are directly below an 500 degrees fahrenheit that they can survive .
at the same time , i was very much about <unk> , which was back from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are looking at the space and and to do the <unk> and the right <unk> , and you drive to russia , through the mission of the <unk> protocol , and we &apos;re going to go to the international <unk> and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but the end of the end , it was that i took the deep sea , and i took the deep sea .
i took them with and <unk> them , and they <unk> them down the world , <unk> , <unk> , people who are interested in those extreme situations , and i took them to the sources that they could take around and and and so on .
we did making it , but actually , science , more , , more , <unk> .
so , the circle of the circle between my existence as a child , and the practice in the reality .
so , over the course of this journey , i &apos;ve been a lot of learning .
i &apos;ve learned a lot of science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking , a director has to have a , and a leader like a <unk> or something like a <unk> or so .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i got this expeditions .
because at a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what does it ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t get us a money .
we &apos;re just going to play the price of the cost .
everybody think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and would have put me the nails on a bench on a beach on the beach .
i have all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no glory , no credit , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task of the task , the challenge of the , and the ocean is the most reliable environment that there are the most important environment because of the weird connection that comes from a little group of people .
because we have all this with just 10 to 12 people , and it &apos;s been worked for years ; sometimes we were two to three months in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have a problem to you because you have a problem that you can &apos;t tell any other .
if you go back to the country , and it says , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole thing , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human <unk> , and you know , you can &apos;t tell you . that &apos;s what you &apos;ve never been through .
there &apos;s a connection , a <unk> respect .
so when i got back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; to turn the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re going to be a team and join in return of respect to respect .
it was really changed the dynamic .
so , i stood back with a little team on the <unk> terrain . we did a avatar with a new technique that hasn &apos;t been before .
so exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were to a moment of a half and a half years to a moment .
so it changed my way to make imaginary , completely .
there were people who thought we had really <unk> these <unk> and put it into the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way of doing my job , the actual process that has changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all of that ?
what are we going to learn ?
i think , &quot; well , i think , &quot; the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the most of the world .
to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me advice , how do i do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you know , you &apos;re not a .
it &apos;s got to be the other for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , no longer for himself , but take risks for you . &quot;
nasa has this one <unk> : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , and in the art , it has to be an alternate , because there &apos;s no one in the .
no big effort that demanded , has been addressed , ever , the only place .
you have to be prepared to take risks like this .
so that &apos;s the idea i want to give you to the way . failure is not an alternate , fear , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you today about energy and climate .
and that surprising may , because my favorite <unk> of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seed , and the things we need to make and deliver to the world to make the world &apos;s the world .
but energy and climate are extremely important for those people , actually , more than any of the planet on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow , many years , we &apos;re not going to fall too much or a little bit of it . the things will change how it can &apos;t withstand their fragile environment .
it leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to .
so , you have a change in the case for you .
it &apos;s also important for them to do it .
in fact , if you could only reduce one thing the price , the energy industry would be far more effective than the most effective .
well , the <unk> is over time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> , the industrial revolution , and in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and therefore we have refrigerators , <unk> , we can make modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
but if we &apos;re cutting the price -- let &apos;s go down the price of half -- we hit a new barrier and this barrier is the <unk> .
co2 warms up the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 that leads to the <unk> , and this <unk> has a lot of negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the most shocking consequence that the natural ecosystems cannot adapt to the , and thus the whole systems .
now , the exact pattern between a <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the other consequences , there are some of them , but not very many .
and there are certainly <unk> of how bad that follow these consequences . but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> multiple times , &quot; have we really have to go down to zero ?
not enough , a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we come close to zero , the temperature will go up .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than say , we have a three-and-a-half square feet a <unk> bridge underneath a three feet bridge , and you can actually reassemble it .
this is the way down to zero .
well , we &apos;re growing a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons of the .
every americans are about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of every planet on the planet .
and somehow we have to change changes that down to zero .
it &apos;s always up .
only different economic changes have been influenced by the way , and we need to go from <unk> levels to zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a drill , and you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get the way to zero , and it will be from the number of people , the average of the <unk> of the <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at each one factor and we think of how we get it to zero .
probably , one has to come to a very close to zero .
now , this is fundamental algebra , but we go through it .
we first have the population .
today , live billion people today .
and it moves on nine billion feet of moving on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with the new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we could see that for 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope about 1.3 .
the second element is the services that we &apos;re using .
it &apos;s all the things that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> is to make these services for almost every to every planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could do more <unk> and less , but at average , this number will be rising and so much more than than twice , the number of services per person will be .
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s lights at home so you can do the homework homework ?
and those students don &apos;t have , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy service per service , there are good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t get up .
because of all kinds of assets , through other <unk> , through new methods in the <unk> , there are many services , and there are many of the individuals that are energy to reduce some of the individuals in the way 90 percent .
in other service , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; : <unk> : <unk> , or the <unk> or <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is a lot smaller for improvements .
in all , if we are optimistic , we &apos;re probably going to get an <unk> factor or maybe even a factor .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now 26 billion to maybe <unk> <unk> , and it just won &apos;t get out of <unk> .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this will be a key -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that per unit of energy is going to be .
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get to zero .
if you &apos;re burning coal , no .
if they &apos;re burning natural gas , no .
almost every <unk> of electricity is co2 today , except renewables .
so , what we need to do on a global scale is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; i mean , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and whose services is a miracle .
people here have helped to develop many of those miracles .
now , there is no a truism that you need a miracle to a certain date .
they usually are just going to be <unk> and some of them , others don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to give the <unk> and a miracle in very short time .
now , i said , how can i really get this ?
is it a natural <unk> , a demo , which is the idea of the people here ?
i remember last year when i got mosquitoes and somehow people like this .
the idea was really , you know , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
and for energy , i was here .
i decided that this was the way of fireflies to be here at the environment .
so here are some of natural fireflies .
you have told me that they don &apos;t bite . they &apos;re actually not going to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot of them .
we need solutions , either one or a number of the organism and the <unk> government for the , and although there are many ways where people are looking for , i really see five that can afford that big demands .
i have the tides , <unk> , fusion and <unk> <unk> .
now , this may actually contribute to a <unk> contribution , and if you do better than i expect , it would be great , but my statement here is that we have to be in all of those five , and we cannot be fooled by them because they have trouble .
so let &apos;s first take the burning fossil fuel fuel , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there , perhaps , but it &apos;s not . you have to go to the co2 that comes from the <unk> , because of the pressure of the <unk> , and then hope that there &apos;s been there .
there are some of the <unk> that are on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get to 100 percent , and they have a huge challenge to the amount of co2 , a big challenge here . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who &apos;s going to make it ?
who can guarantee something that can be more than any of the billions of waste to you can be able to imagine from <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough problem .
next : <unk> .
it has also three big problems . the costs , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question of certainty that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human participation that the fuel isn &apos;t used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so , three very difficult problems that might be solved , and that &apos;s where you should work .
the last three of the five of five .
it &apos;s renewables as they often are called .
and also , -- although it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
for one is the energy that can produce dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 times more than a normal power station .
and they &apos;re also all of these sources of <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be a day , and the wind doesn &apos;t survive .
so , you have to be , if you &apos;re on those sources , you have a way , the energy in time they &apos;re not available to get available .
so there are big <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission , if we say that the power of energy is outside the country , they don &apos;t need the technology , you also have the risk of where the energy of where different from the other .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are made of the cars , computers , computers , <unk> , for everything . and i found out that all the batteries we can now produce less than 10 minutes of the <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough , something that is a factor 100 better than the public approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this happens when you try to get these <unk> sources over the way we &apos;re going to get 20 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to rely on 100 percent of it , they need an incredible <unk> .
now , what should we go , what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project ? how do we go to the destination ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this .
in each of those five areas we need at least 100 people .
so , you &apos;ll say , you &apos;re crazy , and that &apos;s good .
i think here in ted , there are many , which already already , you already get into .
bill &apos;s big has a bunch of companies , including a <unk> , the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is invest in dozens companies , and interesting possibilities and i &apos;m trying to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i &apos;m proposing a company , perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in <unk> , <unk> , central .
now , the development has stopped in this industry before a few months ago , so there &apos;s no great way that some good concepts are lying around .
the <unk> means that you instead of part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a very insane idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve thought about it long , but you couldn &apos;t make reasonable predictions whether it would work , but it &apos;s got modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and see that , yes !
and because you burn that 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better than it is .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste from now as a <unk> .
instead of breaking your head off , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is used to be incremental , a little bit like a candle .
you see , it &apos;s a kind of a column , often as &quot; traveling wave . &quot;
it really does the <unk> .
here &apos;s an image of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s been burned , so , <unk> , it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
the <unk> of the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
so think of how we should measure our success .
what should our study look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to reach and we talk about the <unk> .
many of them are about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest 20 percent will be produced in the poor world , and still , of agriculture , hopefully , <unk> and cement , going to be clean up .
so , to get this 80 percent , the developing countries , including countries like china , their <unk> .
the other note says whether we &apos;re the most advanced technology , whether they &apos;re in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is a key element of this <unk> .
if we go back from there , what should the average 2020 look at ?
it should be the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to get reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing the way . the less we <unk> , the lower it will be the <unk> , and it also happens .
but actually , this note of the things we &apos;re doing is not completely the big <unk> of the , just the same , or even less important , the other people that the speed of innovation is the .
and we have to pursue these breakthroughs with <unk> , and we can measure it : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books that i &apos;m going to do .
al gore book &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david <unk> , &quot; <unk> energy , the <unk> of the hot air . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this is a broad way to be discussed in this broad , because we need to support for all the .
there are a few of that come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very important wish that we invent this technology .
if you just want to give you a wish for the next 50 years , i could pick up the president , a vaccine , and i think that &apos;s , or i could choose that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> , no co2 will take the wish of it .
this has the largest impact .
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the production of the consumer is terrible between the united states and china , between poor and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and
so what do we do ?
what do i do ?
we have to use for more research .
if countries like <unk> meetings , they should not just talk about co2 .
they should talk about these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the slightly low resources that are going to be spent for innovative new approaches .
we need <unk> , <unk> , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade , something that creates a <unk> .
we have to get the message .
we have to have dialogue and and and it &apos;s a whole thing that &apos;s going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s a more important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand , you can &apos;t understand a little bit better -- first , can you give us an idea of the magnitude of this investment ?
bill gates : to make the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists , what we did , we need a few of 10 million and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it works statistically , is just in the <unk> of the .
the hard step is to build the first of the first <unk> , more billion , the <unk> and the place the first one building .
once the first thing is , if he promised it , it &apos;s all clear because the economy , the energy rate is as much as the <unk> of the way we know .
to make the right thing : that means to build deep in the ground , almost like a vertical pillar , this <unk> , and then the process starts off and work backwards ?
<unk> : right . today , you have to get the same as well as you have the reactor , so many people who can go wrong , and this thing you open up and make things like it , and it &apos;s not good !
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can think of it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you &apos;re going to be buried , without the whole complexities .
and it sits there and then , for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , the one solution to the waste .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens with the waste : you can actually put it -- there &apos;s a lot less rubbish with this method -- then take it into the next reactor and burning it .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already in those <unk> or <unk> , and that &apos;s our <unk> .
so , what this reactors is a problem for this , which is what we &apos;re in our own , and it will dramatically reduce the dramatically way to the process .
but as you &apos;ve been talking about different people of this world about those possibilities .
where is the most interesting thing , what is really going to do ?
<unk> : now we haven &apos;t been determined to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for anything called nuclear power in the name , there &apos;s a huge deal and people of the company , india , china -- i was here and i talked to the <unk> and i talked about how this is the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
so this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a <unk> low and some countries built this , that &apos;s why you have a quick quick map of the world , a <unk> for our first .
in your sense , <unk> and probability of this really being in life ?
<unk> : now we need one of those <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got to reinvent for making 20 years and then 20 years to the .
so this is kind of the protests that we have the most of the <unk> that we have to drive .
and , you know , <unk> , if all of it &apos;s good , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could easily hold it .
and fortunately , today , now , now , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of , as if the way that the public policy work for your pilot , it works for the for your pilot to help it .
and it would be the best if it can create multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
in every case , we need a solution .
so the big possible of the great breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would be done without the <unk> , but it &apos;s much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how much like this , but there &apos;s the modular approach , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a fluid that seems a little bit hard , but maybe that &apos;s what we say about .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about this is that a <unk> has a a a a million times as a , say , a <unk> , and therefore , if you can handle the problems , and they &apos;re mostly the kind of thing , the impact of the , the the impact of the world and other things , almost in a own league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to make <unk> , trying to keep the <unk> movement ?
<unk> : if you get to this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re too much eaten too much , and a heart attacks , what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something like that .
there is a <unk> called <unk> , which is the <unk> techniques that we use to <unk> the warming , so we &apos;re going to get to <unk> 20 or 30 years longer .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need it .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be on the insurance protection because you don &apos;t want to be a lazy , so you &apos;re going to eat that one of the <unk> will save .
i don &apos;t know if the wise is the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> about whether you could have this available , if you expect it to the things , or the innovation needs longer , or the way we expect .
<unk> : have you have a or two of sentences for you to be able to convince you ?
<unk> : well , sadly , the skeptics is in very different camp .
people , the most scientific argument , are very little .
tell that there &apos;s negative effects that are going to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things that you can say , of those of those who have a chance of a million .
the <unk> is like this as much as on aids .
you make the mistakes now , and you pay a lot of a lot later .
and therefore , the idea , now , if you have all kinds of problems to invest in something you just got to do , and that is that the investment doesn &apos;t necessarily be so clear .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be concerned .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and the co2 release co2 , the <unk> , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it , but i &apos;m probably not sure that it &apos;s a co2 , but i &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the most <unk> argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that are suffering from malaria and so on that it &apos;s a bad resource of resources to invest money , as there are better things we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- say , we should spend 10 billion per year than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
they didn &apos;t have any of those things .
you &apos;re then to be large , and here &apos;s a <unk> people who disagree with something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund it .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short before a <unk> and funding only the learning curve . i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be much less less less less less .
if the <unk> of the <unk> you get , a very high , , then only the rich will .
i mean , every one of us could spend five times so much of our energy without changing its lifestyle .
for the bottom of two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinking about .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why not have been talking about research ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very <unk> group , and therefore leads to the <unk> .
and this is a of the things i think for appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s been .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all the people here , i &apos;m hoping that you &apos;re going to be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago at ted , he hired peter <unk> a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> have to build the biggest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about three feet and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be up on top .
and , although it really seems to be really , really , really , it &apos;s really hard because people are reluctant to collaborate very quickly .
and so i thought this this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
and then i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops worldwide with students and architects and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> and there is something about this , which is a little bit of the <unk> of the <unk> of the work , and i want to share some of them .
now , most people are actually going to do themselves in the task of being able to get .
you talk about it , what it is going to look like , it &apos;s <unk> .
then you invest a little bit of time and organization , and they &apos;re making spaghetti sauce .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re growing up with the <unk> .
and finally , before you have no time , it takes the marshmallow , and you put it down , you &apos;re going to go back and <unk> , and you get your work back and &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
but what &apos;s going , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is the weight of the <unk> that the whole thing is <unk> and <unk> .
there are a number of people who have a lot more than the <unk> of the <unk> than others , and below the worst , fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they &apos;re really <unk> .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and the best ones are the <unk> of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
how peter did not they did not make the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might think is : how do you go ? why is that ?
and peter tells , &quot; none of the kids spend time in the book of spaghetti <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in the time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that <unk> were trained to find a look , ok !
and then we realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what is the most interesting thing is that they &apos;re going to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , and we build prototypes , and we &apos;re going to build up the way that they were able to repair the way that they have a way to repair the <unk> of the .
<unk> are the way of collaboration as a core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with each trial , kids get feedback feedback and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance of working with prototypes , significantly -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are operating .
the average for most of us is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , there are no more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately , for happiness .
so , a foot is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average , but this is going to be interesting .
put an <unk> administrator on the team , they will significantly better .
it &apos;s amazing . you look around and see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why do this go ?
because they have special skills of the <unk> .
they &apos;re running the process , you understand him .
and the team that regulates the way and work on work in the work , the power of the team are significantly improving .
<unk> skills and <unk> and whose combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical , you get about 6 , the robust structures .
i was trying something exciting .
i thought we &apos;re the same thing .
so i offered a $ $ $ <unk> software for the winner .
what do you think that &apos;s going to do with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if anyone had a <unk> built , he would have been able to put the price home .
so it &apos;s not interesting that high levels have a strong effect ?
we repeated this practice with the same students .
what do you think ?
now , it &apos;s the benefit of the design of the design .
so , the same , bad team was one of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the slightest .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
you might say , why would someone actually invest in time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i help help digital tools and processes to help teams , making the video game video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> is doing is , they &apos;re actually to identify the hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every one has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language or an ethos , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in , can visit to <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see the <unk> of the building .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they &apos;re finding a <unk> examples of all the world as people who optimize the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the most compelling lesson , i think , is the construction of a <unk> exercise .
it requires that we all our senses on the task , and we &apos;re thinking of our thinking , how our emotions and our do , in the challenge that lies ahead of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that needs to get us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- &quot; to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so , we have this machine , and we would have a machine .
a big machine , a cool machine , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to put in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you cannot be in the future ; you cannot be in the future .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i have a lot of my friends , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before cars had cars or twitter or &quot; america , the number of the .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of to be <unk> to <unk> , to <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventurers .
it &apos;s because of the possibilities on this planet , they &apos;re going forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that the ever on this planet , no matter how to fix it : health , wealth , , , wealth , novelty , possibilities , declining <unk> .
there was never been a time like this .
my <unk> died everybody was growing up .
my grandparents <unk> this number of <unk> .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so there &apos;s better at the beginning of my <unk> &apos;s beginning .
but it &apos;s not a way of people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a kid who &apos;s born in new delhi today , you can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographic of the earth in a way , like no war ever did .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases that millions of us have been threatened by a generation , no one .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to explore things , look , if it works , it &apos;s going to change the biggest achievements of mankind .
so that &apos;s the good news .
sadly , that &apos;s all the good news , because there are a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world can go to bed every day hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s rising very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash this world .
drinking water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get rid of this chaos , we &apos;re going to go .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , the billion people will feed , without the land , to rape them , to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t happen at the same time .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is keeping me up at night -- one of the things that i &apos;m sleeping at night , we &apos;ve never been so badly as now , as now , never .
and we were never able to get it statistically , as we can do it today .
we are at the brink of amazing events in many areas , and i really think that we have to go back hundreds of , and i think we have to go back and to find a time where we have to go back and find a time where we have a lot of the things that we have in the world , which is more striking than now .
people are hiding in their faith , and so tightly that you can &apos;t fix it .
not even the truth will escape .
and listen , everybody has a right to your opinion , even a right in terms of progress .
but you know , what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have right on their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to find out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about <unk> for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was stunned to hit the resistance , resistance to the end of the most effective health in health care in the history of mankind .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i did what i was doing , i wrote an article and i continued on .
and soon , i wrote an article about the <unk> of the community .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i was writing about an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules were in a certain rather than a random species of <unk> in nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i continued to go .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we &apos;re going to take , we &apos;re eating , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i figured out why , and finally , i figured out why .
and this is because those who who drives me crazy at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , <unk> people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that got me so confused ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face .
we are at a point where we &apos;re not the same relationship to progress as we used .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
we &apos;re talking ironic that , with a little quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s a reason , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have the trust in the institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of the , , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed they were always right . be they &apos;re always .
ask questions , ask , ask evidence , ask evidence , ask for evidence .
take nothing as granted .
but now comes : if you have to have evidence that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that , that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear of fear of how i never saw them , and i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story of about 12 years ago , a horrible tale that the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine in relation to the <unk> .
very scary .
there were lots of thousands of studies of the study to see if that was true .
there are many studies of studies , that &apos;s a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came in from america , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation , no connection , no .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter any difference because we think of anecdotes , we think what we see what we see what we think we &apos;re really feeling really .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a <unk> , which is data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but do you know what ?
the result of this was devastating .
now , the one of the united states is one of the only country in the world where the <unk> <unk> goes down to measles .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed ashamed .
it &apos;s horrible .
what is happening that we could do this .
well , i understand that . i do .
because does anybody get measles ?
did one one in the audience ever see from measles from measles ?
it doesn &apos;t happen .
in this country , not , but in the world , they &apos;ve not been in the last year .
these are a lot of deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because this is not what happened here , we can denial it , and people like jenny can walk around and messages messages from fear and dozens of platforms and <unk> from platforms and <unk> king live on <unk> .
and they can do that because they &apos;re not connecting and connection .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal to be the same , but almost the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and very quick .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of the most horrifying human race .
not fear , no <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he has just evolved with a few other people .
he can save the life of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , except for that , except , that paul runs through vaccines and how much valuable you are , and people should stop .
and that &apos;s what he says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul <unk> talks about a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell the sea &apos;s <unk> .
he gets calls calls home because people like to tell him , you know , you know where your kids go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
so you go back to the disease , and they go back to terrible diseases , and it &apos;s going to happen .
we have now in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids will die back to that , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not going to die of measles .
what about <unk> ? do we take this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine took me a few weeks ago , and i &apos;m writing , i think i &apos;m a little bit of a little bit .
nobody has ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate their child fighting <unk> . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning , someone in lagos , in a plane , and she flies in the middle of the time , and it &apos;s in the moment he &apos;s in the moment .
and in a few hours he lands , he goes and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;ll visit one of those <unk> tonight tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we &apos;re living . do not do it as if it &apos;s not that .
we love it to us in lie . we love this .
do you all have their vitamins in every morning ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you to the <unk> .
i know they did that because half americans are doing it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take some alternate cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they &apos;re their their own . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you want to be 28 billion dollars for dark pay .
i agree with them .
dark , the dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
now , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have any trust in the system .
and we should not do . our healthcare is .
it &apos;s <unk> to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely cold and <unk> himself , who can afford it .
so we walk away from the way , and we &apos;re going to go out and we &apos;re going to go ?
we &apos;re going to go into the poor of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing , because it &apos;s crap , and we &apos;re going to give billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little <unk> here .
none of them -- <unk> , fraud , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re going to give billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say that , people say , &quot; what do you care ? let &apos;s get the people what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have a wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt the one of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if they &apos;re going to go to this journey , where belief and magic to science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he got 400,000 of his people , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , much more effective than a surgical drugs , we know that they can actually turn the trajectory of the trajectory of aids .
hundreds of deaths in a country that &apos;s worse than any of this disease is <unk> .
don &apos;t you please tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the most salient epidemic that we &apos;re in right now is this <unk> battle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , has been changed by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there were no <unk> . we did this all .
we did it in the last hundred years .
and some of it has worked and some of it .
we &apos;re rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more . and of course , there &apos;s risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and it can help millions of people to extend their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re re-engineering the payoffs a food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m all about is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have a huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent in companies .
we don &apos;t want to have the seeds .
and you know what my answer is that ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we actually fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s a right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not a idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes , but the idea that we don &apos;t need to be able to do to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of a truly <unk> , and it keeps millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to have 70 percent higher than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
you need this , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and why ? re-engineering society changed .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like cassava .
cassava , it &apos;s something that has half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s about how a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all this in the right place .
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t die , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is : why do we do that ?
i mean , we &apos;re asking us : why do we do this ?
because we don &apos;t want to be genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes , it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our environment , better food , better food , the biodiversity .
it &apos;s not about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s about people alive , and it &apos;s going to get the ultimate time to understand what that means .
because do you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to do this , we &apos;re doing something about something we &apos;re doing , i think not , you know , not , &quot; high-tech , &quot; .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our worthy , and we need to really fix it .
so , after this incredible funny , so , you might say , &quot; you want to be in those ridiculous time time and go to the future ? &quot;
in every case , i want to fall in anyway .
right now , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine in everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we &apos;ll move them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think about , but if we go into the time time time , and we &apos;re going to be happy to have done this .
i know we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> , and it sounds odd that a magician is a magician , it &apos;s because , you think , as &quot; a <unk> , who is a little bit real , if someone just thinks it &apos;s enough to it . &quot;
in other words , in some studies have a measurable effect , the <unk> , and it &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to you , whether you &apos;re going to be , if the patient &apos;s only in the brain is the <unk> effect in the body .
a deception is going to be something real , because somebody is that .
so we also understand each other , i want to share a basic basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;ll show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s in every child &apos;s seat for children .
i myself , i &apos;ve learned him from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain him .
so , you see what happens .
the knife that you can study , my hand , that you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife so on my own .
i push my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve or from him , i &apos;ll just get my wrist right here .
in this wise , you can see that there &apos;s anything that moves on it , as long as i can &apos;t walk here , there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , or the .
and the goal of this is just simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and i hope if everything goes well , the knife will absorb the knife through my naked <unk> .
it &apos;s actually sitting in the place that i can shake it without the knife fall .
nothing goes into my sleeve or coming out , no <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often do little kids who are comfortable for magic , because you can actually learn a lot about deception , if you can actually see it , although it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably , many of you are here in the room of this trick .
he works .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m going to go my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve or out of your sleeve , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m my wrist , is that the secret of the illusion is .
so , in the moment , i mean , my hand of you , so you see them from the back , so you see it from the back , the one of the fingers here , my <unk> , just from where he was so <unk> .
great &apos;s trick ?
so in the back , someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and if i &apos;m <unk> , the fingers changes his position .
and now you could talk about why that is a deception , why not not recognize that down here , only three fingers are because the mind and the way that it &apos;s information , and the way that it &apos;s doing information is not unique , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group .
but that &apos;s not actually , it &apos;s not , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s just going to be <unk> , but not through the magnetism of my body , but by my own , , through my body , , which is now .
and if i close my hand , the same thing by drawing me , it &apos;s going to be hidden by this movement that the finger goes back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this is the trick you can show your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what do you do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that i really have really been really the very mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
it &apos;s what it turned out : if you offer a dummy placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a certain measurable effect .
but if you can give the shape where you add to the <unk> , for example , to change a smaller pill , and that blue color and a letters , and a letters on it , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , although none of them have any of the -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me freak me .
but it turned out that that &apos;s not all .
if you take smaller loops , the more effective than anybody else is .
a colored capsule that &apos;s in a end of the end and the other red is , it &apos;s better than a white capsule .
also the fibonacci spider plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as well as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . sorry .
but the real thing is , ...
so ... that the <unk> is a role .
and the form plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you put a patient .
it &apos;s going to make a very powerful picture in your head , which is much more powerful than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;ll show you another one , if we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white ball doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t make as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of it has really <unk> property , it &apos;s just our faith that we can make a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that is obviously a deception , and i &apos;m going to look really .
we know that , from that trial , you have to reach the needle , if it &apos;s supposed to go to the point .
this is a <unk> long <unk> . it &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to start with a little bit of a little bit .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and through them , and they go back on the other side .
if you &apos;re lightly evil -- if you &apos;re lightly out of the -- i showed that a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and i didn &apos;t know , and i &apos;ve had a woman almost powerless .
so i &apos;m proposing if you get a quick nice , then look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first darn part of the back here .
you can see it right , but they can also be <unk> if they want to be .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my flesh begins , at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;ll just make a little excursion .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you get crazy ?
and now , just a little bit of my skin , and on the other hand , it &apos;s back .
now , we &apos;re actually in the same way we had in the <unk> .
about .
but now , can you my fingers not counting , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four .
well , yes ,
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not that stupid and <unk> himself , the skin , just to entertain a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t have it right . &quot;
people are now in the <unk> of the <unk> .
so let me show you that one .
so this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can do it .
sorry . if you &apos;re going to get evil , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
the people in the back , the one later , you see , you know , you &apos;ll see , &quot; well , it looks quite impressive , but if it would be real , it would bleed , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me just <unk> your little bit of blood .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
i usually would take the needle .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think , in this framework , and with the intention of being a bit of deception , i &apos;m going to put the needle in it , and so on the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times .
i hope you &apos;re very happy to do it . thank you .
everybody is talking about happiness today .
i have a number of people who are the number of books that were in the last five years , which is published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they had a lot more than we had .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there are a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier happier .
but despite all of those <unk> of work , there are several cognitive policies that are kind of impossible , and that &apos;s why , you know , to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to be the act of these cognitive .
it &apos;s true for <unk> who are thinking about their own happiness and it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness because it turns out that we are so mess as we are .
the first one is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word is not really , not useful word anymore , because we &apos;re using it to many different kinds of different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could just be able to zoom in it , but in the big , and it &apos;s the one thing we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to think of the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second case is a sense of experience and memory : basically , is it between being happy in your life and happy to be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both of the <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the sad fact that we don &apos;t think about a fact that &apos;s going to be able to think of the , without meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> , one of my lectures , which one story said , &quot; he said he had a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and at the end of the recording , it had a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he added , really , really , emotionally , that &apos;s changed the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had a 20 minutes of music .
they didn &apos;t know because he was a recollection of a recollection of a sudden , and the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what really tells us about that , and we might think about other people , in terms of two types of self .
there is a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present is , can be able to experience the past , but only the present has been .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know if the doctor says , &quot; do it hurt if i &apos;m here you <unk> ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s an <unk> self , and the <unk> self , the <unk> and the history of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor &apos;s doctor , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to have lately ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two part of the <unk> is part of the <unk> of the happiness .
well , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and this really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts to immediately .
we &apos;re not only telling stories , if we &apos;re making stories about stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we &apos;re allowed to be able to have a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example of an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who have a painful process .
i won &apos;t go into the detail . it &apos;s not painful , but it was painful when this trial was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . those are their records .
and they will say , &quot; who have been owned by both ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has got a lot more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a had a patient , and more .
but now , there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much do these patients , that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a much worse <unk> at the <unk> had the patient &apos;s <unk> .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is the way it ends .
and none of those stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the worse worse , the worse is the , the pain was at the end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people , and a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than a than a than a for a than a <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
from the point of the <unk> self , b himself had a worse time .
now , what you could do a do a , and we actually have clinical trial , and it &apos;s done , and it works , you could actually make the <unk> of the patient &apos;s worth of the <unk> in the hose in the way to shake it down to the hose .
it will lead to be suffering , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do a long time , you have to make that the <unk> itself is a bad thing , and you have to change that the <unk> itself is a much better , because now you have a better history of the experience .
so what happens to be a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that makes memory us and it &apos;s true for the stories we make .
so , a story of <unk> are <unk> , major moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , the end is the end .
well , the <unk> self lives live alive .
it has a time of the <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask , what happens to those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i really got this -- you know , the psychological present is for about three seconds . what does you know that in a life , about 600 million of them . there &apos;s no track of them .
most of you are completely ignoring the <unk> itself .
and yet , you have some sense of the idea that you should count that what happens during those moments of the life is going to be our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we &apos;re using in the world .
and how we use it , it would be important , but that &apos;s not the story that the <unk> of the <unk> itself .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the deal of time .
from the point of view itself , if you have a holiday , and the second week it &apos;s pretty good than the first one , then the <unk> holidays twice twice twice as long as the <unk> holidays .
so , it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> <unk> itself is barely better than the <unk> holidays because there &apos;s no new memories .
they have not changed the story .
and in this way , it &apos;s actually the critical variable that is a <unk> self , a <unk> self , and it &apos;s a very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> self is more than to remember and stories .
it &apos;s actually the one of the things that make decisions because if you have a patient , the one , say two <unk> two different surgeons and decide what he &apos;s going to choose , then the surgeon who is chosen .
the <unk> itself has no voice in that election .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between the experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think of the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a result .
we think about our future as a <unk> memories .
and in fact , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self , through experience that doesn &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re a holiday that &apos;s very often , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re doing vacations in the services of the <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little bit of hard to do , i think .
i mean , how much do we do our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was the most of the best holidays i ever had , and i think , quite often in the relationship , i think , how often i think about other .
and i probably probably have a <unk> of my memories to this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had the the the the <unk> of the <unk> , i would have spent an hour .
well , this is three weeks , and that &apos;s a half hours a half hours .
there seems to be a <unk> .
now , i may be a little bit extreme , you know , in the way , i can <unk> on the <unk> of the memories , but even if you do more of it , it &apos;s a real question . why do we give people so much weight in the weight of the weight that we give to account ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the day , all your images are being destroyed , and they get a <unk> drug , so that you &apos;re going to remember .
well , would you choose the same holidays ?
and if you would choose a second , there &apos;s a conflict between their two species of self and you have to think about how to choose that conflict , and it &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of the time , you might get a answer .
why we choose the <unk> , which is a problem that is a choice in a election between the two species of self .
now , the two species of the self is the two words of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments of life in life itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of the most of the <unk> self over time .
if you ask the most of the most of the most important self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not how happy one lives .
it &apos;s a way of being happy or delighted , if this person thinks about life .
very different term .
everybody who are not different from these terms of happiness , and i &apos;m one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that the study of happiness , long , on the time of happiness , on the same way .
the distinction between the <unk> self and the satisfaction of the <unk> itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to get to measure the two levels of the .
the gallup gallup organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have been asked , what they think about their life and over their experiences , and there were other efforts in direction .
so in the past , we started to learn about the of the two species of the self .
and the main lesson that we think is , i think , is that they really are different .
you can know how happy someone &apos;s life , and it doesn &apos;t really tell you much much about how happy it lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the relationship that is a correlation between the context of the relationship .
what that means is that if you would meet someone , and you would say , oh , your dad is a <unk> , how much would you know about the size of your size ?
well , you would have something about the size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much insecurity .
if i tell you that somebody has been life as a eight of the <unk> , and you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is , he &apos;s with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is low .
we know what the happiness is determined to be the .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly means to be happy to people who are like , to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is a dominant .
so if you want to maximize the lucky species of the two species of self , they will do a very different things .
the implication of what i &apos;m told here is that we really don &apos;t think of happiness as a replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different notion .
now , a second reason , one of the reasons that we cannot think of happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things that we think about life and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california are not going to get the answer to the answer .
if you think that question , you think that people have happier in california , if you say , we &apos;re in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re in climate .
well , it turns out that climate &apos;t have very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
well , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up -- some people might pull off to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are moving to california in hope to be happier .
well , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think that you are happier , because if you think about it , because if you think about it , what awful the weather is in ohio , and they will feel that they &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think of well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we had a few weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup survey .
is the thing that you can actually do in the moment , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we found in the gallup survey is a number that we absolutely didn &apos;t foresee .
we found this in terms of the <unk> of the <unk> self .
if we looked at how emotion can vary as much as emotion .
and it turns out that among income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for american , and that &apos;s a very large sample of american american , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a large representative sample , below income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year is people are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting increasingly more less less less than the poorer they are .
we get a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money doesn &apos;t raise a <unk> , but lack of money to be eating , and we can actually measure this miserable , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get a different story .
the more money you make the more , you get the .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , in all the american effort , it &apos;s about life , freedom , ambition to happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be on the head , everything we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that the country is in general a <unk> way to take a <unk> , and it would be doing that for politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s approval for the role of the <unk> in politics .
the <unk> will be slow to the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s just happening in the united kingdom , and in other countries .
people are the people who think think of happiness when they think of politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore or whether they want to explore <unk> , so we have to be able to get this conversation about this conversation .
how you can increase happiness , very different , how you think of the most precious self or whether you think about the <unk> self .
it &apos;s going to change politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you can see the <unk> of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one , or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this topic , or should be at least the most interesting political argument for the future of the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .

i &apos;ve been <unk> for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade , it &apos;s just easy to save the world in reality , how to save in the <unk> .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people , including them , spend more time with play bigger and more <unk> games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we have the real world to solve the real world .
but in fact , i &apos;m talking about the institute of the future , is the opposite of the .
three billion hours per week are not close enough to solve the most significant problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we &apos;re going to increase this time dramatically .
i calculate that that it takes time at 21 billion hours a week .
so that seems like , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , so i repeat it , if we can &apos;t solve issues like hunger and poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think , are we going to try to play games for at least to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean , really , really .
why ? this image describes pretty much , why i think games are so critical for survival of the human species in the future .
this is a tudor tudor photographer of photographers <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotion , so he had a a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classical terms playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may have some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see that sense of urgency , a fear , but also , you have a very difficult problem , and it &apos;s really difficult to get into solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you see a few of the nuances here , the <unk> eyes , and the mouth is a symbols of optimism . the eyebrow shows surprise .
this is a player who on the edge of the so-called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know . ok . so , so we have a couple of players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s so much positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , they &apos;re shocked that they actually can be able to do something like this . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is a brief victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces from the world of <unk> all over the world , if we take the the optimal the next century . the face of those who are facing the <unk> of the <unk> of the edge of the edge of the <unk> .
well , sadly , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life , if we &apos;re difficult to face problems .
i call it as a &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad &quot; <unk> , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok .
i &apos;m like i &apos;m doing this in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my home home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my thesis of what we &apos;re in games are better than in the real life .
so this is a problem that many of the players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as playing in the reality .
and i don &apos;t mean , just less successfully , even though it is .
we &apos;re going to be more . i mean , in relation to the motivation , inspired to do something more , inspired , inspired to work together .
if we are in a <unk> , i think , many of us are moving into our best version , anytime and immediately , to solve the problem of solving the problem , so long as necessary , it &apos;s going to get back to the <unk> .
and in reality , if we fail , if we collide in obstacles , we &apos;re often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we felt we feel , we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these are the emotions we never have , if we play games , they don &apos;t have it .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it possible to think , you could &apos;t just get anything ?
how can we change those feelings from playing into the reality ?
so i looked at what world of warcraft to the <unk> environment to the communal problem problem .
and i realized some things that <unk> <unk> in <unk> , you can do that .
so , first , if you get in one of these <unk> , especially in world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a <unk> mission , and it &apos;s immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at the stage of the game , right ?
so they &apos;re creating this .
they never get a job that you cannot solve .
but always on the edge of your capabilities , so you have to do , but there are no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and you &apos;re around , and there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of individuals .
and where they &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their epic mission .
we have not that simple life in real life , that sense that there is a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> staff .
and also , this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are and what we &apos;re doing .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have been &quot; the level of &quot; the &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + one flower &quot; or &quot; + one of a intelligence .
this constant feedback is not life in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have : + <unk> one , and an <unk> , an insane idea , <unk> , <unk> .
i don &apos;t get this feedback life in the real life .
so , the problem of <unk> like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at any of the edge of a <unk> , that we prefer to spend our entire time in the <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
all the way to today , all the world of <unk> have been spent <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
it &apos;s not necessarily bad bad .
it sounds like fine .
but to see it in context , a million years ago , we began to go to our first <unk> .
so the first one is going to go .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend on playing with play , that just makes sense when you &apos;re at the scale of the human life , which is something &apos;s really .
but also , the appropriate thing . because it turns out that we &apos;re using all of the time to play , actually what we &apos;re able to do as a human being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
we &apos;re developing to collaborative , so , thanks to the human beings .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
so , look at this interesting statistics that recently published by a researcher of carnegie mellon : the average boy of the <unk> of today with a <unk> country with a powerful <unk> with <unk> <unk> to the 21 .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first one , for kids in america , they are <unk> hours of the <unk> that they spend in school from the high school , from the <unk> of high school -- if you never absent .
so we have a complete set of <unk> in the young people , what it means to be a good player , how everything they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> , &quot;
so , you know your theory of success , the theory of the great hours of the day .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the <unk> that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> of the <unk> of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the
we &apos;re going to be so good at what the most famous people in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is : &quot; what are the player &apos;s worth good ? &quot;
because if we could figure out that , we would have never been able to have a human opportunity before .
so many people have now in the world at least one hour , with <unk> per day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are pretty good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
the <unk> <unk> developed <unk> , the energy and on work on work , rather than the <unk> of the world , and so , the <unk> of the world , especially in india , china , can play online .
you &apos;re expected to be a little billion player in the next decade .
so we have a billion a billion of the .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it is , to master these games .
here are the four things i thought , first : <unk> .
ok , imagine what it &apos;s like extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the urge to do something , to master a challenge , and we think that we have a hopeful of hope .
now , there &apos;s always a <unk> victory that &apos;s possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and it &apos;s the same .
they &apos;re not sitting around .
player are masters in the spiders of the spiders of social nets .
there are a lot of interesting research that shows that we may have more than we &apos;ve been playing with them , even if we &apos;ve been fooled to them , even if they were all bad .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone playing a game .
we trust that somebody &apos;s time with us , that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same goal and to the end of the .
so the <unk> of the brain is the growing of bonds , trust and interact with each other .
as a result of this , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic .
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> per week , as a <unk> .
the reason is that if we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happier at work , hard to work hard than we &apos;re going to relax or anything .
we know that we &apos;re being in human beings , we &apos;re going to be optimal work , if we do hard work .
and player are always ready to work hard , if they get the right job .
and finally , epic meaning .
player are , i love to be part of awe <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> to move to the right light , and you &apos;re all all the wikipedia , the largest devil of the world .
the second largest devil in the world , at nearly 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have been talking about world of warcraft on the internet than any other <unk> of the world .
they &apos;re creating a epic story .
they &apos;re creating a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so , so these are four superpowers , which are the only result , player are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe they can change as individuals .
and the only problem is that you think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not less than a <unk> of a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i ... i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit of a .
so he says that that makes sense , because the player can be more than in the real life .
they can actually knit the social bond in games than in the real life , they get more feedback about and reward in games than in the real life .
so he says , it &apos;s currently fully logical that the player are more time in the virtual world than in the real .
i just agree that is logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we have to start to transform the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that was a 2,500 years .
there are this ancient cube , from <unk> . do you know ?
before this fabulous <unk> gave the <unk> .
and that was the first of the first people to get <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the the the the old of the old greek of <unk> , you may know that story , the story about how and why games were invented .
according to <unk> , games were actually invented , in the u.k. , in the u.k. , during a famine .
in fact , there was such a great famine that king of <unk> was a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed to be extreme .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> national strategy , a day , you would eat , the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> of the , because games are so fascinating and <unk> with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would never forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survive , for 18 years by doing this famine by doing a day and the next day .
so , i think , i &apos;m going to do a play today .
we &apos;re playing games to escape from the physical world .
we &apos;re putting a game to make all the way that in the real world , which is not in the real world , especially in the real life , and we &apos;re going to get us what we need to play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting .
it was not better than 18 years after 18 years , so the king , one last <unk> .
they shared the u.k. in two .
they played a <unk> and the <unk> were allowed to be a <unk> adventure .
they were <unk> <unk> , and they went to looking for a new home . they were just letting a lot of people back to the survival of the survival and looking for the rest of the place where they could flourish .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but recent <unk> show that the <unk> , which is the roman empire , the same dna as the old ones .
so scientists came to the realization that <unk> insane story is actually right .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> , which was almost 20 years , which was the famine .
so this is a <unk> of the voices .
maybe they actually have their people through play through play by 18 years by 18 years , and then those <unk> had been and and so much about the other , that they would have been rescued all the civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing with 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real world of <unk> , which was 16 years ago .
they were playing 18 years long , we &apos;ve been <unk> for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to the quest to go to a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should be <unk> that half of us have an hour a day with playing , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s the question i &apos;ve dedicated my work in the last few years at the future for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it &apos;s the way we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is the future .
we want to introduce the best outcome , and then people are trying to implement this idea of the reality .
we &apos;re going to be <unk> , and give people the opportunity to get them .
i &apos;m just showing you a little bit of three games that i designed to try to give people to <unk> people in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to cross a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it &apos;s going to be realistic , and you &apos;re going to be in the real time , you &apos;ll tell you where you &apos;re living , and then you get to be <unk> , and then you get to be <unk> , or to be .
we &apos;ve been tested with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an transformative experience .
nobody wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or it &apos;s the environment .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they survive , most of our players have their <unk> .
so we have a bigger game for the next generation of a bigger , higher target than just <unk> .
we have the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the the future for the future .
so , the is the calculating of a truism that the people are only about 23 years on planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call to the <unk> , we have a <unk> <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s &quot; <unk> , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only together , they can save the world .
but in our play , instead of just five people , we say , everybody &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 player played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 500 solutions to read , if they &apos;re &quot; <unk> &quot; .
and the last game we &apos;re going to do on the third march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award of the world &apos;s world , graduated from 2010 .
we work with colleges in africa and invite them to learn social learning .
we have a comic book for the , we have &quot; level &quot; for <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all the to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in <unk> , the world &apos;s own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end .
i want to ask you a little bit .
what do you think , next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t have rescued the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that the player &apos;s human resources are the way we can use in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these <unk> , <unk> productivity , the ability to knit up narrow social networks , <unk> and desire for the <unk> .
i really hope that we play the great games to survive on this planet to survive .
and i hope you &apos;ll play and play with me .
if i &apos;m in the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create a future that we can make any of the future , and we can all play games .
so i &apos;m saying , &quot; let &apos;s start playing the <unk> .
thank you .
i would like to tell you something about what i was writing about a few months ago , a article on the <unk> of wired magazine .
i &apos;ve always been writing my <unk> , but i was with the edit of texts , and i realized that i never have ever been in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled &quot;
i read the post .
&quot; disabled &quot; , <unk> : &quot; <unk> , <unk> , destroyed , mutilated , mutilated , mutilated , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend loud , and he had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i was not going to get up to &quot; breath , and i had to stop reading and to stop reading , and i had to stop to see the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> and that <unk> <unk> .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought that the output has been pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s when i just started primary at the primary , and began to build my sense of self outside of my family , and to form , in terms of other kids and the other around the world around me .
and god , i didn &apos;t use a <unk> at the time .
i would like to take this post seriously , i would be born in a world that someone who would be a person like me as a person whose life can &apos;t be positive in any other way , but today i &apos;m going to have a chance of opportunity to win .
so i immediately have to tell me the <unk> of 2009 , and i &apos;m expected to find a <unk> of the .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t happen much better .
especially , the last two words of &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s what we think about the people we describe to these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in in those words , and how we build these values .
our language influenced our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks and the <unk> , really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> has a big force because what you can do is <unk> .
so , what do we actually want to do -- one disabled man or a powerful people ?
in fact , people are <unk> as a kid , if you could , you know , you &apos;re <unk> and you &apos;re going to give them some ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up doors ?
a man who opened me to doors was my pediatrician at the <unk> <unk> institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name , how you can think of most americans don &apos;t know , and so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. augustine always carried very colorful and was just done for kids .
i found the time i &apos;ve been doing in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had to make an awful lot of tasks about these big , <unk> <unk> -- -- you know , to build my <unk> , and i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even been talking about a <unk> kid with dr. <unk> , and trying to stop doing this practice , <unk> without success .
and one day he has been observed in one of my practice -- these exercise was just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girls , you &apos;re going to have one of those <unk> .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and it was just a simple trick by dr. <unk> , so i did the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect of getting married girls in the hospital , but he actually , i &apos;m going to see my daily <unk> in the second hive . but he actually got a new and <unk> experience .
and i &apos;m a question today , how much of my vision of me as intense and powerful girls , and i could imagine , as one of nature from nature , powerful and <unk> human beings .
so , this is just an example of many of how adults can be able to be able to be able to be able to change the imagination .
but as they &apos;re already <unk> examples of the <unk> , not to make us a space to imagine what we would ever wish to do : to make each one of us , to see each one of us , to see ourselves as a powerful people .
our language is <unk> the social change behind , which is caused in many cases of a technological change .
and from the medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> for aging body , which is to be able to use their natural fate , and they &apos;re going to be able to make their own , really all their possibilities and beyond the limits of the way that they &apos;re making their natural fate .
so maybe it &apos;s the technological change that technological change is clear because the fact that there was always a different truth , which is that every person in society can make a difference and and that the human ability to adapt and be very powerful , and that the human skill to adapt , and that the human skill to adapt , and that the human skill to adapt , and that the human skill to adapt , and that the human skill to adapt , and that the human skill to adapt .
the human skill adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell how i &apos;m talking about <unk> , and i &apos;m always very uncomfortable with the questions of me , and i &apos;m always very uncomfortable with the questions of me , and i &apos;m always very uncomfortable with the questions of me , and i &apos;m always very uncomfortable with the questions of me , and i &apos;m always very uncomfortable with the questions of me , and i &apos;m always very uncomfortable with the questions of me , and i
this is the <unk> of the idea of how much is the idea that success or happiness depends on being able to master , without having any of the associated with it , because i could be able to see the kinds of a life with a prosthetic , or how much people would be the way to be able to be .
but the truth is that we are changing . we &apos;re from the challenge of whether it &apos;s physical , emotionally or even both is both .
and i &apos;m saying that that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not a obstacle that we need to be able to do to get to our life .
<unk> are just to our lives .
and i tend to see , as i &apos;m seeing , as i &apos;m seeing .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very close , sometimes he &apos;s very much in front of it , but he &apos;s always in my mind .
and i want to address that way to the effect of the <unk> of a human being <unk> .
there are <unk> and challenges , and those are just <unk> real and every person walks in it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to get out with <unk> , or not , but we &apos;ll get it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to preserve the <unk> of the , but they &apos;re preparing to prepare for it to be clear .
and we don &apos;t like our kids , if we give them the feeling that they cannot adapt .
you have to get two things out : to one of the medical fact , to be amputated and to the other people , and to the other people , the idea of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability , which i had to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to be , is that the world is always the same way , you can describe me with these definitions .
in our wish to protect the people who are the heart , and you &apos;re the cool , hard truth about your medical projections , or even one of the <unk> to the quality of life that you expect , we have to be a disabled .
maybe the concept of the concept of what is in a broken , and how we repair it , for each one of a greater disability than the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being holistically and not all of its forces and possibilities , we can create addition to the natural struggle that you might have to have a more disease .
we &apos;re a human being , which is a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and we &apos;re all the part of the human possibilities .
but most important , but most important , it &apos;s between perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not be <unk> , or not <unk> , or not , we should not try to avoid them , we should be able to see them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about the <unk> opportunity .
it &apos;s perhaps more important to me , that we don &apos;t necessarily have to solve the <unk> , but we &apos;re open to hug it to the <unk> , and maybe even dancing with it .
and maybe we can do it as a natural as a natural , <unk> and useful , and feel that way through their presence , and feel that way through their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . the birthday of charles darwin and when it was about 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , in my eyes , in a very true character .
i would like to use it : not the most powerful of his species , and not the most of his species , but the one who can adapt to the best .
we have a variety of years of a matter of innovation .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and <unk> , from the struggle of the human mind is determined to transform itself through conflict .
so again , change and <unk> are the biggest attributes of the people .
and maybe we know what wood wood is we &apos;re carved out of , if we really are tested .
maybe that &apos;s the point of <unk> , a sense of the <unk> , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give a new meaning that &apos;s going on the very difficult time .
maybe we can see ourselves as change as change .
<unk> are the key to change that we haven &apos;t adapted .
i think the biggest harm that we have to do is believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s face it -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there are the normal . the typical thing , but not the normal ones , and would you really learn that poor , gray person who really want to learn if they really were ?
i think , rather than not .
it would be great if we could make this paradigm of the normal against the other , or the strength to actually make it even a little bit more than to make it even a little bit more than to create a little bit more dangerous , and they &apos;re invite the forces from a very large and valuable skill to society .
now , <unk> , we found that we have a <unk> of our society to be useful to be useful to be useful and to contribute to a contributions .
there are evidence that the neanderthals was born over 60,000 years ago , and people with severe physical injuries with the <unk> , and that happened because the <unk> in the <unk> of these people was valuable .
they didn &apos;t have the people as broken and useless ; they were being treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago i went in the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the northeast of the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood in front of a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to see , and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember it .
and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t remember remember .
when i first saw it , i was brought her off her mother . &quot;
oh , so .
and of course , it &apos;s got , of course .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i knew about a little bit of narratives about this day , because i was of course , was to be very close to my birthday , i was going to late .
the doctor of <unk> diagnostics was on the holidays , and so my parents knew the man who had me to the world , not .
and because i was born with no <unk> , and my feet went down to them , and i just got a few toes on this one and a few toe on the other foot , he had had to have to have to the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to say to me , you would never walk , and never be able to be able to be able to have any other kids , or you can &apos;t have a independent life , and then she &apos;s just lying to me . &quot;
i really found that he had accumulated the <unk> of my childhood , whether i had a <unk> in the second grade , whether i had the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , whether i had my skis or one of my graduate student , and he used to get the clips to teach his students , <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
and he called this part of his <unk> &apos;s the x , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t just point enough to see how critical of the quality of life can be .
and dr. <unk> told me , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they didn &apos;t get any other , and even if you get a little bit of support , you can get kids very much . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his mind .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone do it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking over time , if you were asked at 15 years of the <unk> of meat and bones , i would have no second <unk> .
i was absolutely going to be normal at the time .
if you ask me , i &apos;m not that sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i have a little bit of my legs and not despite that experience .
and maybe that change could happen , because i &apos;m actually able to have so many people who opened me to the doors instead of people who have me to me , or i wanted to give me an idea of a .
see , it really needs a people who can show you how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you give someone to make it , your own , inner forces , the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can do it , and for somebody in a critical moment , you are a very good teachers .
they bring them to open doors and open doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that in one is , the potential of the opportunity .
again , what do we want to do , because now we &apos;re ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , was actually done in the early days .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are going to be <unk> .
and the students are getting <unk> harder , and the better teachers are going to get on etc .
they have a <unk> period of time with a &quot; enough &quot; grade &quot; &quot; &quot; the grade &quot; &quot; well , &quot; it was told you were <unk> , they were very smart , they were very smart , and after those three months they really written .
and of course , it &apos;s got to hear a heart that the <unk> was told the <unk> , they &apos;re only enough .
and it was the three months .
but only those who were still in the school -- except of the students who had had to have to school .
and very , very , very , very , very , very important in this study was that the teacher were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just simply told that the <unk> and that are the students who are the grade , and they &apos;re also trained to them and they &apos;re treating them .
the only real disability is a <unk> spirit of the mind that has been broken , no hope , no longer , no more <unk> , our natural , <unk> <unk> and our innate skill of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human spirit of support , to be able to support himself and other people around us , and then we &apos;re putting our forces really positive .
if a spirit of those qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that &apos;s been <unk> by a <unk> poet called <unk> in the 14th century , and i &apos;m talking about my friend jacques <unk> , and the poem is , &quot; god knows god , not god knows , &quot; god knows god , the god , who knows four words . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you be better than they are right now ?
suppose i said that , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory -- more , more , more , more , more .
or you want to be more , more powerful , more force .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be , longer , live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who have always been <unk> .
which would you like most of them ?
what would you like to have to have one of them , if you could just have one one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose to choose ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about many of the way there are creative people .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you decide for a good memory ?
a few more .
what about a matter ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to do , as a doctor .
if you could have one one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is this just a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> theme here on ted ted , but today i want to give you the idea of a doctor &apos;s opinion .
the great geneticists in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , a paper , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t matter except in the evolution of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to take your <unk> , take your personal <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you a look at the <unk> -- and you can &apos;t have a look at the <unk> -- and you can see you that you &apos;re about the <unk> -- and you can &apos;t have a look at the <unk> of the talk to you .
but if you &apos;re in biological evolution , think of this : is it just over the past , or is it the future ?
is it for other <unk> or too , it &apos;s also ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree , all the <unk> of the <unk> of the branches of the branches in evolutionary terms of the <unk> of the twigs in evolutionary terms of the <unk> of the twigs in evolutionary terms .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re interested in most of .
we &apos;re looking at the branches of a common ancestor about six or eight million years ago .
in this time , there were maybe 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some have come come .
we &apos;ve been here for about 2,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re relatively remote from the other parts of the redwood of life , but actually most part of the most part , the fundamental mechanisms are actually the same part of our cells .
is it clear that we can use , and the mechanisms of a common bacteria can produce the protein of the human <unk> , which is used to treat <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> of what &apos;s going to happen from the pancreas .
and we talked about bacteria , is that every one of us in our gut are more bacteria than it &apos;s cells going to the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , think , if antonio damasio asks the sense of your sense of view , you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria .
it &apos;s very hot , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re all the nutrients that you can just want to want to be in terms of your effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way to bacteria , with occasional <unk> of the unintended <unk> , <unk> forced to exit .
but then , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for those bacteria , as they are important for their life .
they &apos;re helping the <unk> of the <unk> nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a form of <unk> balance in form of a species ?
or are we designed to be something else -- something that maybe even better at the environment ?
so we &apos;re going back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first biggest thing , perhaps three to four billion years ago -- the first biggest thing , perhaps three to four years ago -- the first biggest thing , perhaps three to four years of the earth -- the first <unk> of the things in the last recent years .
in this vast lively symphony of the universe , life on earth just about it , just to the animal kingdom , the animal , as one stroke , and the human life , a little <unk> .
we were .
this is also the most popular of this talk , which is why i hope it was like it .
now , when i was a <unk> college in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i created a very fundamental thing : in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will go on both .
but at the time , as a <unk> organisms , they began to change the things .
sexual reproduction is happening in the picture .
and important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the the genome of the , the rest of the body &apos;s disease .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now , i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , &quot; well , sex / death , sex , death for sex -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but with every year , it seemed to my have to my have to my .
i &apos;ve come to understand the emotions of george burns , who read in las vegas his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , it &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
front of it , a beautifully <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is great , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization of a doctor that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily , only different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to hold to hold .
i wanted to rebuild the health of disease .
i wanted to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all over the age of the genome to the next generation , <unk> and survive generation generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i like <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage , to move down to the sea .
i think we would all have the mood , the medicines of all the expression of the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get to do with my work .
i want to do it by not going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to think of the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution is the creatures that are at best in their environment .
it &apos;s only the only of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are <unk> , and by the hot , the hot , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum , they have a <unk> environment to make .
so what does that mean , if we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place of the people in evolution , and particularly as we &apos;re in the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for that , we would be able to have a lot of the gene , we &apos;ve succeeded , a lot of genes that were otherwise to be otherwise , and from the population .
and second , we regarded as a species , our environment , we have that we have done that they adapt to us .
and by the way , we migrate and and actually circulate and mix so much that they can &apos;t tell longer , that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolution .
a second option is that it &apos;s an evolution of the traditional species , of course , <unk> by the forces of nature .
and the argument here , this is the wheels of the evolution of evolution , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far the isolation is , if we &apos;re a species distant planets , it will be <unk> and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural fashion .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a <unk> , fascinating , terrifying possibility of a shocking opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- the new development of the not just natural , but led to us as a <unk> in the choices we do .
now , how did this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
so , we think of the reality that people are today , in some cultures , they are making more choices about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the election , to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the one and the family .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible to choose your child &apos;s gender , but also to the body , but to prevent the disease , to heal the disease and prevent disease .
what if you could do the genetic change , to be diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or or or alzheimer &apos;s disease ?
would you want to do it , those changes are in their genes ?
if we were <unk> , these kinds of changes are being possible .
the human genomes project started in 1990 and it took 13 years .
it cost $ <unk> billion dollars .
the next year , when it was done , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can sequence a sequence of three billion base base of the human genome at a price of $ $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t take long for the reality to the reality that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly accessible to everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , two scientists , the independent process that the <unk> of the natural process of evolution , and to <unk> proteins , in a more efficient fashion -- which is <unk> arnold .
a few years ago , the <unk> of the scientists who was <unk> <unk> for his research in which he took a grown-up <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four gene , the cell is being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in your body .
these changes are in .
the same technology that makes the human insulin in bacteria , that can &apos;t be <unk> in the way itself , but also to the movement of the other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental trial in gang with vaccine in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco &apos;s tobacco ?
this is all the reality today , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so , imagine just two other changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could have the sperm and <unk> or the <unk> , or the newly <unk> <unk> , to give your kids a better chance for a life life -- because of diabetes , the <unk> , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be healthier kids ?
and then the <unk> technique , the same motor of science can be able to prevent disease , could also be able to adopt <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- better memory .
why don &apos;t the <unk> of an ken <unk> , especially if you extend it , the next generation of the <unk> ?
why not the quick <unk> that can allow them to walk faster and go longer longer ?
why not longer live ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we are in a place that we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the <unk> of the we &apos;re going to be transformed from <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that has probably been 100,000 years , and we can compress it in a thousand years , and we can actually compress it in a thousand years , and maybe even in the next hundred years .
these are decisions associated with those who are their grandkids , or their grandkids , have to be .
do we use these choices to form a society that &apos;s better , the more successful than the more effective than more .
or will we selectively choose to choose different kinds of choices that we want to have some of us , and not for others ?
are we going to form a society , and <unk> is , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom of the most part that we need to need to make these choices ?
in the good ones in the evil , and they used to think , are these decisions about us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something like this , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills or another , the <unk> , and go up to the <unk> .
we &apos;re called these robots <unk> .
they &apos;re not different than something that you put in the morning and gives them more strength and your velocity will continue to be the , and will help you to keep your balance .
this is indeed the true man of man and machine .
but not only that -- that &apos;s together , and connect them with the universe and other devices .
so this is not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we begin to talk about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on the back , and it &apos;s the request that they should be able to carry more detail .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought that we would take this challenge , and create a <unk> , which would help us to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to <unk> -- or the human universal <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can carry 200 pounds over <unk> terrain , for hours of hours .
so flexible design enables it to be able to be able to sit down to the surface and <unk> and highly observable movements .
it feels what i want to go and and so , and so , my strength and stamina .
we are so far with our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> of this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s look at the wheelchair wheelchair , something that i particularly passionate about .
there are 2,000 million people who are in the world in the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s what a conservative estimate is .
we often talk about very young people with spinal cord with spinal cord , which is -- 20s , &apos; 20s -- from the fate , the <unk> , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , those of those things are .
and so , the only option -- if it comes to a <unk> , or about the other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been for 500 years since his , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could begin to write a whole new chapter in the realm of mobility .
so let me introduce you to <unk> , that amanda <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a <unk> , which was a <unk> , which was not going to walk , it has been going to run the , and to now .
thank you .
i said , amanda , we &apos;re our <unk> .
it has sensors .
its completely <unk> sensors in the 1970s , the signals that are the signals that are on their <unk> , which is on their back .
here are also <unk> , the <unk> is at its hips , as as they <unk> their <unk> , moving forward , and very natural <unk> .
i was a <unk> age of age , as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not a long time a doctor in my graduate school , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s making any of the <unk> of my <unk> hope .
and <unk> technologies have been <unk> , and then , again , to go back to the <unk> and even with the hands .
but nothing was invented , that would be me back to the right now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential to change life from the future -- not just for the military , or for amanda , but for amanda , but for all the wheelchair users .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of a non-profit non-profit non-profit non-profit called robin hood .
if i didn &apos;t get the poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> , a volunteer bag of the fire .
now , in our cities , in the volunteers , a <unk> <unk> , you have to be very early on the <unk> to be able to get to the <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers on the <unk> , so i had a pretty good opportunity to go .
but it was still a races for the other volunteers to achieve the authorities and figure out what our jobs would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had just a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which certainly had one of the most horrifying days of their life .
it was the middle of the night , and she stood in the <unk> and <unk> under a screen in the <unk> of the <unk> of the rain , while her house was in flames .
the other volunteers that came out to me was there -- we call him <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the <unk> .
the dog ! i was stunned by envy .
there was any lawyer or <unk> , who now for the rest of his life , the people who could tell him that he was going to save a living house , only because he was five seconds .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and have to get a few of the shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped i would , but i went -- the stairs tall , the hallway , the hallway , the hallway , the <unk> , the <unk> , which is the little bit done to get a few of the shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my <unk> back down , where i was my <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our treasures out of the outside of the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his much more than my .
a few weeks later , the <unk> was a letter of the <unk> , where she was in the brave <unk> of the <unk> of her house .
one of them are <unk> <unk> <unk> , somebody had actually brought their up a few of the shoes .
both in my graduate times , when i was a volunteer author , i am a witness of generosity and kindness at the big scale , but i also see the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , if i see myself in this room , and people see that they have been achieved a <unk> success or on their way , i want to be able to offer to remind you , wait .
wait for that to make a difference in life another , until they &apos;ve reached their first one .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;re now .
they &apos;re in a <unk> , they &apos;re in the neighborhood , they &apos;re in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , you will offer a chance to save life , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so , put on , save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just going back from a community that knows the secret of the human race .
a place where the women are doing the <unk> , with sex &apos; say , &quot; and the game determines -- where fun is a serious deal .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your relationships .
this is the world of the wild bonobo in the congo of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with chimpanzees , our next living relative .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which was about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are familiar with their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the <unk> in the ecosystem of human evolution .
but bonobos do show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees from large , fear of <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> females .
they really have a very , because this leads to a <unk> society that has not been observed in the lethal force .
but sadly , bonobos are the least known in the primates .
they live in the depths of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the reason is it &apos;s hard to be .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness -- the location of a violent argument for decades , and almost as many lives , as many lives , as many lives .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this , that , that , the <unk> of the bonobos survive .
and the <unk> of the <unk> lead to that you don &apos;t even have a <unk> ship with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there &apos;s not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that the trees are horrified .
who are these related ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> , even <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and regulations , and regulations , and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that that &apos;s the answer to all humanitarian issues -- because life is more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- how people -- love to play your life .
play is not just a <unk> .
and it &apos;s a fundamental tool for us and it &apos;s a fundamental relationship for the relationship of the tolerance .
we &apos;re going to learn and the rules of the game .
play has become creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you observe the bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and ritual .
play is the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique images straight from the wild .
first one is a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think of <unk> .
so here we &apos;re going to see a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a <unk> female .
look at what it does .
it could be the evolutionary origins of &quot; it &apos;s got him to the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s not true .
yeah !
so , <unk> are spread , both in the bonobos than people .
and this is really interesting , because it shows -- and this is a video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the game of both faith -- like the testes -- and also , how the game is doing both of faith as a -- and also , the game of the game is doing both faith as too much as it -- as it does it .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take many forms of the things that some little bit quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to explore the wonder again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays the money with water .
i think , just like you &apos;re playing , and we &apos;re <unk> boundaries of our inner and the our our our our our our inner worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity that makes us science and interact , and the unexpected narratives that we form , are the real breeding ground of the creativity .
this is just a smaller <unk> of the insights that the bonobos are facing us in our past and present .
but it &apos;s also true to our future , a future where we need to adapt to comprehensive challenges of comprehensive health and more motivated cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these abilities .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
so , to adapt to a <unk> world , we have to play .
but are we going to do the best of our <unk> ?
play isn &apos;t silly , is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people , don &apos;t live in the teeth and claws alone .
just if it seems barely appropriate , you may have to be the <unk> .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and playing , as we play the creativity of the <unk> and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to introduce you to introduce yourself to two pairs , the middle 1979 , at the same moment , every <unk> of a baby .
so , two pairs , every one &apos;s a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to be able to imagine too much time because if you &apos;re all the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be able to imagine , you &apos;re not listening to me .
so imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , a y <unk> is actually the <unk> chromosome in the <unk> .
and in the other case , it carries a x chromosome that &apos;s the x chromosome of the <unk> .
both are <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people .
most of my operations , i have two hats .
i &apos;m a hat i &apos;m involved with the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m a study of <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- like they were in <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> .
the other hat i carried on my work is the the <unk> of the <unk> -- or , as i say , as a impatient -- from people who are patients who are patients .
in this case , i worked with people who have the <unk> , the social social norms .
so , i &apos;ve been working with people who are identical identical , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people , whose gender &apos;s <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as general , we can use the word of <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms of the .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the kinds of examples of <unk> that don &apos;t represent the male or female standard .
in one case , you may have a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of y <unk> leaves the <unk> , which we all have <unk> , to testes down to testes .
and therefore , the testicles are the <unk> of testosterone .
but because of this individual lack of the receptors to detect the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so , a lot of testosterone , but no reaction .
as a result , the body develops more of the <unk> female trajectory .
if your kid &apos;s born , you look like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as girls .
but it &apos;s usually until time and their breasts grow and develop , but not your period , until somebody comes to that here is something else .
and they do a few tests and find out that instead of <unk> and <unk> , testicles in fact testicles in a <unk> chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could be able to hold this person to actually male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , how men , have something that you &apos;re called <unk> .
they are in the back part of our bodies .
and the <unk> spots are <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most of the women , as i -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real , but i think i probably have the typical -- most of the women like i &apos;m talking to <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like i actually have a brain that has more <unk> , than a woman who was born with testicles , and a <unk> .
so , gender , so , gender is really complicated ; they &apos;re not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed across the entire spectrum .
one of a , a few years ago , i got the call of a 19 man , who was born as young as young , he had a girlfriend , had had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , he had been <unk> and had a uterus .
he had an extreme form of a <unk> <unk> .
he has <unk> <unk> , and in the womb , his <unk> were so active that they &apos;re essentially a male <unk> .
and as a result , his <unk> were male male , his brain was the most <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one could see .
and when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was in the <unk> of the fact that the physicians found out that he was in the core of individuals .
okay , just a quick example of <unk> for a type of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , they &apos;re developing the <unk> , which is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so , gender , in many different varieties of different varieties .
the reason why kids are with this type of bodies -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or identical , whether it &apos;s <unk> -- from surgeons often are being adapted to the norm , not because that &apos;s the case for its physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often have a lot of different kinds of surgical <unk> , because they threaten our social categories .
it &apos;s typically based on the idea that a certain of them is in a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to have a female identity , to be a black person , is to be allegedly , to be an african anatomy in terms of the history .
so we have this horrible idea of this .
and if we are faced with a body that &apos;s actually something very different , confused , that &apos;s what we &apos;re in terms of this <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas of <unk> .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , if kids are born , the two people are born in a body .
where i &apos;ve been hearing most of the most exciting , was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender was asked at the <unk> world &apos;s <unk> in a question .
a lot of journalists , i said to me , &quot; what you can do , &quot; what you &apos;re going to do , whether <unk> <unk> female or male is ? &quot;
and i had to explain to explain that there &apos;s no one test .
now we know that gender is complicated enough to admit that nature is not line between male and female , or between males and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female
so we have a situation where the further our science is , we need to be able to say that these categories that we &apos;ve kept in robust economically entities that made very simple <unk> to create permanent <unk> , much more than we &apos;ve accepted .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also in terms of a time of time , which is as much more complicated than our primary <unk> has been completed .
in our <unk> , we &apos;re in all kinds of different areas .
we push for example in the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what do we do with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them through a few levels of <unk> ?
as we keep our science continually forward , we &apos;re increasingly in an zone of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , where we have to recognize that the most powerful categories that we probably had too simple .
we see this in all kinds of different parts of the human life .
one of the areas that we see in the <unk> of the world &apos;s culture in our current region , the middle of the world , are the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we have a hard set of conversations about what point a body of the people , so that it &apos;s a different way than the act of fetal life .
we have very hard now -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- where the question is when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been struggling to fight , when someone was dead .
they have someone who had a feather in the nose , and if they moved , they didn &apos;t buried it .
if they weren &apos;t moving , you buried it .
but today , we are in a situation where we &apos;re taking people to grow organs and they want to put them in other people .
and as a result , we were in the struggle with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that &apos;s what it takes us to a really hard situation where we &apos;re not as simple in the case .
now , you might assume that the whole thing of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> would be really happy .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with more , but i have to admit , it &apos;s a little bit .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , is tense .
and it makes me feel tense in terms of the question of the democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to first grade that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , where they did , i &apos;m going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten to .
it &apos;s because of what <unk> is happening with the <unk> .
the founding were from my view of the original <unk> activists , and that &apos;s why .
what she was <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it by another , which was radical and beautiful , and for 200 years to us .
as you all remember , he rejected our founding the concept of monarchy , and monarchy was in the bottom of a very simple concept of anatomy .
the masters of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who have political power to have this political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of the month to the father and so on .
the founding meadows opened this idea and they replace them through a new concept , and this concept that all the people were being created .
they <unk> the playing field , and i decided that <unk> , the similarity , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now , they did this part because they were part of a <unk> system , in which two things in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , they grew up the science .
if you look at the history of the founding , it &apos;s clearly that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from the <unk> of the <unk> way , and amazingly things , like a psychic concept of power , where the transmission of a very <unk> concept of <unk> is based on the <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they speak about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of this , they did a concept of <unk> similarity .
and so , they have really wonderful way to the future rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened next years ?
for example , women , the <unk> <unk> , the concept of the founding , which says that there is no more important than the normal difference , and said that we have a uterus and <unk> , and we have a <unk> and <unk> is not important enough that we have a uterus and <unk> than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than
and women <unk> successfully .
next one was the successful movement of the time , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> it , &quot; isn &apos;t i &apos;m a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of the <unk> , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of color color , which is in common common <unk> differences , again , successfully .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the similarities , we have to start asking why we &apos;re going to sustain certain <unk> .
now , mind , i want to be certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish like a fish like a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be right to get your informed consent to get your informed consent to get to sex consent .
so there are some anatomic <unk> that make sense of me , and we &apos;re going to think of it .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and why we &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been completed at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both the middle 1979 at the same day .
imagine that one of them , maria , three months of <unk> , she &apos;s born in june june 1980 .
<unk> , on the other hand , he &apos;s born to the <unk> , he &apos;s born on one march 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria three months of <unk> was born , they would get all kinds of <unk> of <unk> -- the right to to have a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , to choose the right to to drink that .
<unk> has to wait for all of this , not because it &apos;s actually a different biological age , only because of the birth of his birth .
we &apos;re going to find other <unk> in what their rights are .
henry , you think he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the <unk> -- because you think it &apos;s male , can now be moved in , what maria maria never have to worry .
maria , , can &apos;t be the same way in all the way that <unk> <unk> in all the states , and that &apos;s right to get married .
henry can be married in every state , but maria can only get a woman today .
so we have these permanent <unk> categories that are very problematic in many ways . questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing this realm of the anatomy that we need to be a point where we need to admit that a democracy that &apos;s going on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , it feels like the science is going to be infinite .
so what are we going to go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude : &quot; well , we have to pull off a line , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people were <unk> in a very strange position .
so for example , i mean , texas at a point that i decided to get a man , you know , you can have a y chromosome , and a woman to marry you &apos;re a foot in a foot .
now in practice , people are not tested for their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers a dream of a , &quot; a way to a solution .
he says , we shouldn &apos;t be &quot; their skin color , but according to the quality of their character , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you humans have people who are their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re in terms of people &apos;s rights to people because i have to admit that i have a series of golden <unk> that probably don &apos;t deserve more than any people i know .
i want to say that i probably want to know some of the light of the most bright <unk> of more intelligent and more more comfortable making more complex decisions than some of the most <unk> i know .
so how do we say the question for the properties of the character ?
it &apos;s really hard to be .
and part of me tell you , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future of the world -- using an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really important seems to think about the idea that the united states is being informed , think about questions about the question of democracy .
in our endeavor of democracy , we have our thing right , and i think we would make our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , for instance , in iran , where a man who are attracted to the other men who are being punished to the other men , unless he &apos;s prepared to be a <unk> , in which case he &apos;s going to stay alive .
states of this kind of thing exist .
i &apos;m glad to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon who i spoke to a few years ago who had a few <unk> identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical identical twins to get them to be a name .
but when i was doing it , and he asked him why he did this surgeries -- it was up to the <unk> surgeries -- his answer that the kids were very badly treated , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , have a political asylum in consideration instead of them to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offer to be incredible possibilities to be people who are , they are , without it , they &apos;re going to change the state .
so i think , we have to be a leader .
all right , just to finish , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about dads .
and i want to think about the possibilities of democracy , or could have been , if we could have the mothers more .
and i want to say something that is a bit radical , and i think , that there might be different kinds of insight , which is the different kinds of different people , <unk> , if people are a <unk> .
since years , i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i was interested in research in research in the field of the .
and one of the things that i really thought interesting is the difference between men and women in ways they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve seen from <unk> studies is that women , average -- not every , but in average -- more complex , complex social relationships and the caring for people who are in the group are being a very much of the people who are in the group are being very much of .
and that &apos;s why we think about it , we have an interesting situation of us .
when i did an graduate graduate school , i asked myself a of my favorite who who had been interested in feminism , i felt like a feminist , and i felt like it -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s on the feminism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i ever heard .
so in feminism , it &apos;s about stereotypes about gender , so is not a female .
but the more i thought about the question of this , so much i thought there might be a little bit of <unk> in feminism .
it &apos;s called , there might be something , in average , which is moving female brains of male differ from male <unk> , which is <unk> to <unk> social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> for the <unk> .
so , where the founding fathers were extremely popular to find out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we &apos;re more moms in this concept of how to protect , but how we can make it .
and maybe it &apos;s what we have to go into the future when we think democracy about anatomy -- less than the individual bodies think of thinking about the individual bodies of thinking , and more about relationships .
that if we &apos;re trying to make a people a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it to every moment , to every one , to take a sense of a different <unk> , <unk> , and i &apos;m going to take a <unk> and to <unk> .
but i don &apos;t buy anything .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the influence of my <unk> to the environment , and also my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars for usual good reasons ; i &apos;m looking pretty unique to go to my own personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it my size ?
am i like to paint the color ?
is it less than 20 dollars ?
if all answers you , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been packing for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve got brought up .
i brought up seven pair of underwear , and that &apos;s all .
they &apos;re all the time of the , all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i have a bet that i would be able to wear anything else , i would have to be able to find if i was going to get to a nearby .
and since you didn &apos;t heard about me than the woman who is at ted in the underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i want to show you my favorite week for this week .
does it sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to leave you with some of the lessons that i think you &apos;re not or not , from those <unk> , i &apos;ve learned to wear it .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole <unk> , including the juice , i paid up to 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried around this week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological is impossible to be bad <unk> when you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to be happy people happy people .
tuesday : all the time is totally <unk> .
i have been spending a lot of time of my life to try and adapt to myself , and adapt to adapt .
just be who you are .
if you &apos;re around with the right people , they &apos;re not just understanding it , they &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say i thought i &apos;d like &quot; dress &quot; games , or i remember her seven-year-old .
i love to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good , then it &apos;s almost certainly like that .
and if you think they &apos;re not good , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother that was taught a day for day .
but only when i got to be , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll just summarize that for you .
if you think that you &apos;re inside and the outside of the , there is nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there are no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to do anything to <unk> , what we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit in everything .
and finally , saturday , a own , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about one , to tell you about one , without talking about a word .
it was always being recognized , and again , when i got to get people in this week , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all into my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll put it back to the back .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let &apos;s go .
i don &apos;t have to get rid of these things , because the the road is always going to be a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which only on me , i &apos;m waiting for a little bit of love in my heart , and it &apos;s quest .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as a flying <unk> .
so , what we &apos;re in our lab , <unk> design .
so let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m kind of italian , and every one of the boy in italy , in the way , but the reason why i show you this is that in the past decades .
so a few time ago , it was so that if you wanted a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a good race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the races .
now , you need , if you want to win a race , actually , something like this , something like this , a few thousand sensors that are the information that &apos;s information , and then they use them to send the information back to the system and then they use that car to send things back to the system .
this would be , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made from two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> part .
what &apos;s interesting is the <unk> start to be in our life .
our cities were , in the last few years , they just tagged with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be in the free .
and as computers in the free , they start to be able to react to other ways , and they &apos;re being seen .
if we &apos;re cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this experience and drive the power of the everyday life .
this is from an exhibit that paola antonelli for moma later in the year , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; that with me . &quot;
well , all our objects , our environment , starting to talk back to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if any atom is out there to be any of the atom in a sensor and a <unk> .
and that is how radical interaction we have with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo &apos;s shaped moses , it &apos;s the hammer at the end of the hammer , and he went to moses -- actually , you can still see a little spot of <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now today , our environment begins to the very first time to answer to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and push it .
so let &apos;s start with the slightest .
now the first project i want to introduce you is in fact , one of the first of our lab .
it was formed a half years ago .
and what we did was actually , was actually a new type of network of the world that has been deployed all over the world -- this is a <unk> -- and <unk> and <unk> information from this network that are being gathered out of the operators .
the summer was a happier summer -- in 2006 .
it was the <unk> in italy .
some of you remember , it was a <unk> in italy , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , italy won at the end .
now look at what happened on this day , only watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
in the end of the afternoon , people here , and there , the calls and moving .
the game begins to -- silence .
france is a gateway . italy is a gateway .
<unk> , people make a quick call , go on the restroom .
second <unk> . end of the normal .
first of the , second .
<unk> , in a moment of the <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
now , at that night , everybody went to the center .
they saw the big rash .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the <unk> and the the minister at the same time .
and then all the down .
you see the picture of the place of <unk> , where , since the <unk> time , the people to celebrate -- to celebrate a big party , and you see the point at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel today , in a way we couldn &apos;t do it before .
and quick , for example , for example , it &apos;s not about people , but we &apos;re about things that we use and consume things .
now , we know , we know anything about how our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the potato chips , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we know just a little bit of where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little marker on the <unk> of the trash as it comes through the system .
so we started with a couple of volunteers who we had a year ago , in seattle , have helped to highlight the things that they can see -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would take away .
then we have the little potato chips , the little brands , put on the trash , and started track him .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and with this information , we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same thing in doing with less energy .
the data had not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that if we see that if we see that if we see that , that we see that the cup that we &apos;re throwing away , not just disappearing that it &apos;s still in the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re still there .
and if we were to show that , we can push a behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague on mit , <unk> <unk> , could you much much more about the experience and the many of the other wonderful things that you can do with the experience of , but i want to talk to the second part of the world , and that &apos;s the main largest of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> , and he said that spain and <unk> have a nice tradition to use the public places in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were at mit , in a <unk> , was , to imagine these tubes , and you &apos;re the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and closing .
they &apos;re going to be what a <unk> <unk> with <unk> water .
if those <unk> fall , you can write it , you can see pattern , images , text .
and they can get closer to him , and he &apos;s going to open up to you , as you can see on this image .
well , we introduced the mayor of the mayor .
it &apos;s very much .
and we got the mission of designing a building in the entrance to the the .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was out of water .
there are no doors or the windows , but if you &apos;re closer to it , it &apos;ll open up and get it into it .
the roof was covered with water .
and if it &apos;s manuscripts , if you want to drop the syringes , they can actually lower the roof .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , that days , if you get the roof , you get images of people who were there and say , &quot; they &apos;ve been destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t have the building , it &apos;s just that the architecture is almost going .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who are wondering what happens inside the inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not wet .
now , i should tell you what one night when all the sensors were stopped .
but actually it was a little bit more fun in this night .
all kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that would open up to you , but a building that had still breaks back and <unk> holes in the water , you had to jump to jump down .
and that was , for us , really exciting , because as architects , as architects , as designer , we always think about how people are using the things we designing .
but the reality is always more .
and that &apos;s the nice thing to create things that are used to be used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections of the .
and this is what we got to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine that <unk> could actually start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter that flies through the air , and every one of them with a little <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , as you saw earlier , the one that you saw earlier , in the same way , in the <unk> .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> display or display , like this -- a <unk> formation in two dimensions .
or nonetheless , in three dimensions , what is changing , the light is the position of the <unk> .
they can play with different kinds of different kinds .
imagine imagine from the screen , just in different <unk> or large , in different ways of different .
but then it could just be a 3d cloud from <unk> , which they can walk and through them , they can look at them from many , many ways .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you turn the light on the light , it looks like this , so as we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single one of people are being being .
it could have any one that could have a impulse that comes from people from the movements of the human beings or whatnot .
i want to show you something to first of all .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in milan -- we took his movements in 3d , to use it as a pulse for the <unk> .
here you see <unk> <unk> .
on the left hand , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so that you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have <unk> , you can play with color motion and <unk> .
we want to use a kind of a possible to use a possible situation for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working for the olympic games in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to do the people in the way to do something and the environment -- almost like we call it , <unk> , as you &apos;re going to move a <unk> , but with a clouds .
imagine that every one can give a little donation for a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable thing happened last years , the last few years , is that we are changing from a physical digital world .
it has digitized , knowledge , and it &apos;s available through the internet .
now , we can first -- and the campaign obama did that -- can we can change the digital world , from the <unk> forces of the network of the physical world .
so , in our case , we &apos;re using it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what the city is built .
but tomorrow , it can be to us the challenges of the challenges -- think of climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change the digital world to physical .
so the idea is that we actually are the people in the way that they &apos;re doing things together , collectively .
the cloud is a cloud from <unk> , in the same way a difference is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as opposed to our cloud , as opposed to the cloud of the <unk> .
it &apos;s an physical , in london , but with <unk> .
they can move and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments of <unk> 2012 and more and more and more and more and it as a relationship to community .
so both the physical headline in the sky and something at the top you can go to the very top of the new <unk> of the new <unk> .
you can get in .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i think very important .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to say that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> .
i <unk> awe .
my heart was a <unk> , and i was trying to summarize what was going to me .
the <unk> <unk> around me almost 60 feet from the water , and i was just wondering that this was a snowflake in another foreign bloc , year after year .
<unk> are born a <unk> of the glacier or a calf of the glacier , or they &apos;re going to break out of <unk> .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with the very environment with their experience and their experience .
some of the people are <unk> and <unk> the <unk> , while others don &apos;t get more withstand and in a <unk> , more than a <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think it &apos;s easy to be isolated , and alone , as we often see people .
but the truth is far away from that .
as a iceberg , i <unk> the <unk> atmosphere .
during the iceberg , it puts out <unk> water , which is a lot of life forms of life .
i &apos;m going to be like this <unk> of this <unk> , as if i was making portraits of my ancestors , in the sense that they are in those individual moments , and never again .
it &apos;s not a death , if it &apos;s melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a <unk> of their <unk> &apos;s life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> of the <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you you is a iceberg that i put in greenland in greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you actually witnessed an uninhabited case .
here you see here .
on the left hand , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please watch the form of the block , and where it &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to roll it , and the boat goes to the other side , the man stands there .
that &apos;s the average size of a <unk> .
he reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this is in real time .
and just like , it shows you a different side of your personality .
thank you .
my life is really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really .
but at the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the world .
then one day , he came back from running and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use your eyes .
i stood up to him .
i have a company that &apos;s designing and animations , graffiti is a very <unk> part of what we admire in the art museum and watch .
so we decided to have that , tony -- <unk> -- and his thing to support .
i met with his dad and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk back to him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , it &apos;s not -- i &apos;ve seen a wonder -- cannot &apos;t be able to communicate all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you have to higher higher <unk> , and you have a remarkable insurance insurance , you can actually do this .
normal people are not available to those things . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how does you communicate ? &quot;
anybody see the film &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot;
so they communicate -- so they walk up their finger .
i &apos;m a <unk> , &quot; well , how can this be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just a check , and instead i put a check from which i didn &apos;t know the <unk> idea how i should <unk> him .
i &apos;m going to ask me to the place and he goes to his brother and his dad -- &quot; well , my proposal is that , &quot; is that , we &apos;ll get a device and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do his art again .
because it &apos;s a flashlight that somebody who is in all this one in the way that it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i spoke to a conference for a few months later .
i met these people from <unk> , and there &apos;s a technology that allows you to put a light on any surface and then to draw on a <unk> on any surface of the , which only the negative surface .
so they &apos;re going to make them around and make it <unk> like this .
they say that all the things that are displayed up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the testes , then the <unk> , and finally , the most of the most powerful , and finally , people are actually doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home , and i had dinner with my wife and told her and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , that &apos;s what it would be .
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve done some things .
first , we have the <unk> of the doors , and actually actually , for <unk> , a device that he can communicate -- a <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i &apos;m going to call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy &apos;s amazing . &quot;
we also have seven juice of all the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i pulled into the garage , and this hackers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
and many of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid , to do that and we were all the pictures of the walls would be <unk> .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids were involved , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we &apos;ve got to put on the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things out of the hardware and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , they put it on a <unk> , and we have a device that &apos;s available to the bottom , and you can build it ourselves , we can make it for ourselves , we can download it for free .
so we created a device that is completely free to constraints .
no insurance can &apos;t be a insurance insurance .
it &apos;s not a hospital .
now , every paralyzed can actually communicate with your eyes , or drawing .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this image , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all this <unk> of the great revelation .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , drew tony for the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life life system , and it &apos;s going to see his life life system .
we &apos;re the <unk> down so he can see it outside .
we put a <unk> assessment on a wall of the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was in the parking lot .
we also had to be in the parking lot of the , so we felt as a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he sent us an email from the point for the first time for seven years .
i have the feeling , i got to the water and finally got somebody down to the bottom and i got off my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that keeps us at the <unk> and we keep going to continue to develop .
and we have to improve much of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes a <unk> moment .
and somebody who has a such <unk> potential , it deserves much more .
so we &apos;re in trying to figure out how to do it better , faster and more powerful .
since that time , we have all kinds of appreciation .
we won a few awards .
think , it &apos;s free , no one of us deserves to it .
it comes from our own pockets .
so the fates were , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then in december , the <unk> , the 50 of the 50 best inventions of 2010 , which was really dandy .
the <unk> of this is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that this april , in the <unk> <unk> in downtown los angeles , is a exhibit called &quot; the type of the <unk> &quot;
and there are probably the toughest representatives of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all those guys will be there .
it &apos;s part of the show , which is quite <unk> .
so basically , i &apos;m saying , if you see something that is impossible , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this microphone , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
do it possible -- all of them .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had something to do with <unk> , but i just got to see something and i &apos;m going to surround myself with amazing people so we could put things on the legs .
and that question would be each of you , and that every day , where you have a little bit of comfortable , that needs to be done , if not , when ? and if not i , who &apos;s ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most popular <unk> .
and i &apos;m always saying that i don &apos;t want to come from a scientist , therefore , i want to come .
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever voted a farmer .
today i want to tell you today about circles and <unk> .
well , an epiphany is something that you find something that you find out , because you have no one in the way .
you go to the block and it &apos;s an epiphany .
this is a picture of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of that i want to tell you today .
my circle began in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who every week in the <unk> green and blue , until a teacher was going to save my life .
she saved my life by putting the toilet in the <unk> .
they did this .
it did it for three years .
and i had to take away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and at the &apos; 80s , i found it a very important thing at <unk> .
so about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , a woman post , which said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never know one as adults , we &apos;ve never known as adults .
you can ask for ohio , and please come with the man that i know they &apos;ve had seen it .
and i should say that i have a <unk> , and i want you to go to me . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughing , we cried , and we knew that it had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we got them , and we were us , and we gave us eight , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman who taught me as adults , i wanted to know , turned back into a box , and she was placed in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of the i spoke to it .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she has rescued my life , and my partners and i have your own .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is now been mentioned .
it needs the same -- it needs love , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give those things .
thank you .
imagine a large explosion as they &apos;re on 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it sounds like <unk> .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had been <unk> , and we weren &apos;t so much away .
you could see the manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it &apos;s the <unk> .
so imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the most famous words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> for the &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk about the <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share three things that i &apos;ve learned from this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things we &apos;d like to do in life , and i thought to all the people i wanted to hand a hand , and didn &apos;t do it , all the the the <unk> , i wanted to do , and i never did .
as i thought about it , i realized a phrase that is : &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wines .
because if the wine is , and the person is , then i open it .
i never want to be able to live in life .
and this urgency of the , this goal , my life really changed .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and this was when we were the george <unk> bridge , so it was a pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , &quot; man , there &apos;s one thing i really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my own mistakes , i &apos;ll be better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego .
and i <unk> the time i &apos;ve got on the <unk> of the <unk> , with people who are something .
and i thought to the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have a <unk> with my wife .
it feels great .
i don &apos;t try to have , right , i &apos;m a good thing to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and in the internal watch , 15 , 14 , <unk> ... &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing in 20 parts of the way you know it from a thousand .
as we &apos;re <unk> , i had this feeling , human beings , dead , not .
almost as we would prepare for our life for us .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go . i love my life .
and this sadness <unk> really , in a sense , which is that i just want one thing to do .
i wish i could grow up my kids grow up .
and a month after after that , i visited a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not much of <unk> talent ...
... not .
and i &apos;m <unk> , i &apos;m like a little kid .
and in the world , it was making a sense of me .
i realized that at the time , i realized that the dots connected to each other that it &apos;s just a great dad .
more than anything , everything else is my single goal in life , a good dad .
i became the miracle of being able to die of this day .
i got another gift , which is , in the future , and come back and and <unk> .
my call to all the today &apos;s going to be , is : imagine the same thing on your flight -- please -- but imagine how you &apos;re changing ?
what would you do that because they think they were forever ?
how would you change your relationship and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parent that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want to build the bomb .
the most important post for the development is the <unk> of nuclear weapons .
the gray boxes that you see here , these are <unk> .
if we can do well , the systems of <unk> , which control and the valves , we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these <unk> boxes are not going to run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we manage it , a effective <unk> of a laptop computer system that &apos;s used by a <unk> <unk> , to <unk> this gray box , then we &apos;re in the business .
and this is the planning behind the <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will <unk> into the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s a piece of cake , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve figured out .
when we began to <unk> our research on six months ago , was completely unknown , which was the purpose and purpose of this was <unk> .
the only thing we knew about is very , very complicated , which is the most part of the most part of the most part , and it made by various <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed like a little bit of <unk> , with these <unk> boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of our attention and we began a <unk> project where we were exposed to our environment with <unk> , and we looked at this construct .
and then something happened .
<unk> <unk> was like a <unk> that doesn &apos;t like our cheese , but <unk> it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after that , after the different kinds of cheese , i decided that this is an <unk> attack .
fully to one particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> is active in the middle line , if a special configuration is discovered , even if the special program that is trying to get to the end of the .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t happen .
so , that really , i really got my interest , and we began to work with it , almost 24 / 7 , because i thought we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , an <unk> american power station , or a <unk> of germany .
so we should get better soon , what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> , we found out the <unk> code , and we found that it &apos;s <unk> into two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also felt that they were very professional designed , from people who obviously had all the information available .
they knew any bits and <unk> they had to attack .
probably , they knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew anything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s complex , and high-tech , let me tell you , &quot; the <unk> are a science .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks pretty much like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so what we were looking for for the first , <unk> <unk> , because we know what this is going to do .
and then we went to <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring that with the real world in relation to potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about this goals that we could prove or to prove .
to order to make these theories , we &apos;re going to remind ourselves that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s probably in iran because there are most people have been hijacked .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not a few thousand goals .
essentially , it &apos;s the <unk> power plant and the <unk> of the <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m going to give me a list of all the experts for <unk> and power power from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them and <unk> her knowledge to compare their expertise to what we &apos;ve found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring us to the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the rotor is this moving part of the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you tamper the speed of this <unk> , you can actually turn the velocity and eventually to keep the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it was slowly to make it slowly and so much , obviously , to <unk> , so clearly in the trial , to make <unk> , so that you can &apos;t be able to get into the situation that you would not be able to get to .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of the way we were looking at very closely and <unk> .
so for example , the number of plastic bottles are actually very out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
i started using scientific literature , and we found how this <unk> <unk> was built in <unk> , and found out that they &apos;re so <unk> in what we call , and every <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense of making sense that fit together .
and it was better .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we &apos;ve been found in the <unk> ?
a almost identical structure .
so again , this really fit the fit .
and this gave us big faith for this , which we studied here .
now , don &apos;t understand me , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
these results were achieved by several weeks of a very long job .
and often we &apos;re very , very easily running in a <unk> , and we had to collect .
but anyway , we found that both of the digital warheads in reality is really a and the same goal of the , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> and slowed down and the large <unk> , and the large <unk> is <unk> with six <unk> in interaction and <unk> .
so , in the big , and we &apos;re very comfortable that we actually have the goal of what is the goal .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry about that other goals could be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- it really made me out of the feeling .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and the top you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is to do is that the auditory values of sensors -- for example , for example , from <unk> and <unk> -- and it provides a <unk> code that &apos;s still in the attack , which is still on the wrong data , the <unk> .
and indeed , this false <unk> data has been taken before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
now , the idea of this is obviously not just the <unk> of the control system .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more unexpected .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> cannot react to the .
so in a power station , for example , if you &apos;re going to get the big <unk> , you have to open up <unk> in milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so on this point , we need digital <unk> .
and if the danger are endangered , then , bad things can happen .
the power power can explode .
and neither the <unk> , nor the <unk> will notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this is <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have anything to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so he would like to work right -- in a power station , or in a <unk> power station .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the predator -- you don &apos;t have to be able to have a <unk> stick on a <unk> stick , as we &apos;ve seen it in the <unk> .
you could also use a regular technology to use .
you have to just get it as much as possible .
and if you do that , you &apos;ll actually get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the implication we have to ask us .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for those attacks are not in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the most sensitive environments .
we have to make the consequences of the consequences , and we &apos;re going to prepare for us .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been a lot of that people think that the main <unk> is the <unk> .
is that also yours ?
okay , you want to know this ?
yeah . okay .
and i think , in my opinion , the most education is , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the most of the most frequent superpower .
there are only one , and those are the united states -- fortunately , happiness .
because otherwise we would be even bigger .
thank you for you have a <unk> <unk> . thanks ralph .
i &apos;ve been spending the last few years to think of the things that are very difficult and the same thing is dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i &apos;ve been working in a <unk> of a <unk> .
i was being filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i &apos;ve spent a 30 days of it , nothing than this -- -- i &apos;m going to start with a little bit of a little bit of hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the most part of my career , and i think that all of the things for trying to explore social , and i think , in ways , and i hope to understand what it &apos;s doing for the audience of the audience .
so when i knew i would come here to look like this , to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i was going to make something a little bit .
some of you may have heard about it , i had an ad on ebay .
i send a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> of my tedtalk .
and really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , the unique opportunity -- i &apos;m sure that chris anderson never -- that you see that chris anderson has never come back to the talk to you , which is not a title of the time .
so what you got to get , was , you know , you show this : my tedtalk , where you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and the one of the things that you could actually get to the and the the the way to the ears , especially if i could get her <unk> for her <unk> .
but it time , but it &apos;s a very good opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these ted tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite this warning , i knew that anybody would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked this , i wouldn &apos;t have able to tell you that with certainty .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of the marketing , the ad .
as i said , i &apos;ve been doing a pretty awful situation in a few pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing to me , to make anything so hard and so dangerous as i &apos;m going to go to the guy .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the entire film is going to be done by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that everything goes from up to the end , from the end up till the end , with brands , the end of the <unk> , you &apos;ll see the name of the film .
now this tag , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people are being connected to the film in the age of the time -- forever .
and so the movie is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in forever , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to the emphasis .
it was &quot; in forever , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only the brand tag as a <unk> , but we &apos;ll certainly be able to sell any possible possible possible possible to sell any possible spots in the film .
so we might have a shoe like that , and it &apos;s the greatest shoe that you ever worn .
the greatest car that you ever got , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the greatest drink that you ever have , a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , apart from that , is that you can be part of the part of life , actually , to finance the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the film of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love to be happy if the <unk> of the time of doing this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be <unk> people .
have you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , because it has a negative <unk> -- but you know how this will evolve ?
how much money does it take to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth a very popular brands .
who knows if the film comes out , we might see how a <unk> of <unk> .
what do you think , what the answer is going to be ?
the answer will probably be &quot; no .
but is it a difficult thing about the film , or a difficult thing about me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , it &apos;s not as optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we have to think about what brands can .
yeah .
if you look at people who have them to do it ...
there are some of the places we can turn .
so imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera that we wanted to be a <unk> .
it turned out that it was actually meant , &quot; we want to do with nothing . &quot;
and just like all those companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something about the film .
i was stunned .
they didn &apos;t have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising , your product as many people as possible to present to the many people as possible , as many people can see .
especially in the world today , at this project of new and old media and the most progressive environment -- isn &apos;t the idea of being in this new exciting <unk> that the masses is a message .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
that would be no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
see if you &apos;re in the <unk> of the <unk> , this is one of the first images that seem to be .
i really like , you know , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to detect and <unk> , immediately understand , <unk> from <unk> and the access to information , especially , <unk> -- the last line , the last line , is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot of transparency .
our politicians are saying it , our president says , even our ceos are saying it .
but if it comes to that , it &apos;s going to be implemented , something else is .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this curious bear , still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what &apos;s even risky ?
a whole plate cool <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i first started talking to the companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell you that you &apos;re telling us our story . &quot;
see when i was a kid , and my dad was lying in lying -- and he &apos;s sitting in and look at me at this point -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the actual version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the story .
but there &apos;s only one company , an authority , and it was ready to help us -- and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve been john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , and i had to go to the companies .
so what they suddenly began to understand -- or what i began to understand -- was that if you start to speak to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a <unk> problem .
i have friends , the big , gigantic <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> like i do .
and my friends , the big , gigantic <unk> , say that the reason why your movies are so successful , to the <unk> , they have .
and then my friends , who are little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big ones , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how do we see the <unk> in the film ?
whenever i do my journey , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see ban .
and every time i &apos;m a little bit , i can say , &quot; are you there &apos;s fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ? you see a little bit of a little bit .
i want to help you to calm down .
maybe you should give you a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of those great <unk> .
you &apos;re either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be both for men as well as being able to be with women -- they &apos;re <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can all answer your questions and give you an <unk> version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a <unk> brand .
so we don &apos;t have such a budget like the other brands .
so , i think that -- you know , remembers people -- that &apos;s sort of why we &apos;re interested in .
so , what about words would you describe to ban ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that is somebody who is the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about audacious , fresh .
i think , &quot; the &quot; is a great word that this is really important to something positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting odor and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you out .
how can we keep them longer out of the -- better fresh , more fresh , more fresh .
those things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which is like i , <unk> .
you &apos;re going to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
<unk> , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i love like a nice clothing .
<unk> <unk> : the <unk> of the <unk> , except at the <unk> .
well , what is the brand <unk> ?
that &apos;s unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and stuff like this .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and so a piece of stuff .
if dan might be a brand , he would probably be a classic devil &apos;s <unk> .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , is , i would say , <unk> fly .
part of them : part of the part of the part of <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> across the country , the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my name is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man five : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
does that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we cannot be all the <unk> , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of glamour glamour and <unk> fly .
and what is noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could actually find out of my head , somebody who really can help me to understand what you called &quot; the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called johannes <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to detect these <unk> .
if you could do it for the , they could help me help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit about how that with your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people who are my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : the world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- how people are around the , the family , the way you live life , the work and so .
all of those things come from and start from a place , and i &apos;m going to start with my family in west virginia .
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
the next thing . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is that context is to the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like to ask you .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what is it going to us ?
what is the <unk> ? what is the most prolific are you right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
what else do they have to do have ?
... it doesn &apos;t have to be a fear . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you !
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be made .
there was a lot of kooks things that went .
the first thing i saw was this idea that its <unk> <unk> are two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a <unk> relationship with it .
and i think some companies are just going to be on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to be -- and that &apos;s human nature -- things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re afraid of , they &apos;re afraid of those elements , and they turn them into something positive , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what else do you do ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it , <unk> , wii , <unk> by mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , those things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if anybody asked them to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , how would you be ?
you &apos;re a <unk> ? are you something that is your blood &apos;s blood ?
or are you more likely to be a <unk> ?
are you something that a little quiet , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , the calcium <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , agile and agile , profane , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk>
or are they like a <unk> ?
are you <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; compassionate ?
are they reliable , stable , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and the dalai lama ?
in the course of the , we had more than 500 companies that got up and <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t have anything to do with this film because they didn &apos;t control control , no control over the finished product .
but then , the most of the <unk> were ready to get to those control that make them feel like that , and how i , and the reason we would have to tell us stories about stories that we couldn &apos;t have to tell -- stories that can &apos;t support a <unk> .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story about this film that you &apos;re using the history of the brain , and to make the <unk> of the brain , and to make imaginary .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> is banned .
in the entire town , there &apos;s no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , no .
and we went to school school where companies are in the way of their way to the schools in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects of whom i got most feedback from the most of the most successful , which is where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what those brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that agencies may not really have their interests in the sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think think of the way that we think of our view .
and what was that for you ? what it was successful ?
now , the film that film festival was the film festival , we can look at this .
it was the first time of the <unk> in january , and it &apos;s been -- and this is not once -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
it actually actually a time span of two weeks a half a half a half .
this is just online -- not press press , no television .
the film didn &apos;t break .
there &apos;s not one in the case . no <unk> .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
well , finally , the film would have a very large momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , which is almost every <unk> we talked about , the customer , who are the fingers of being able to leave .
something i think is that if you take your chance of control , risks that in those risks .
i think if you keep people from them , then you get closer to failure .
i think if you trained employees to avoid risks , you get to the whole company to get a profit for profit .
i have the feeling that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunity that you might be <unk> .
finally , when we go forward , we should be the fear of the .
we should put the bear in the cage .
call the fear of fear . they &apos;re welcome to risk .
a big wave of a big spoon , so we &apos;re welcome to the risk .
and finally , we should be transparency .
today , more than ever before , it &apos;s a little bit of honesty .
and that &apos;s what i said , with honesty and transparency , my my name , &quot; transparency , &quot; she &apos;s been to be transparency , &quot; was to tell you from my good friends of <unk> , who <unk> $ <unk> for the <unk> on ebay .
big data are being transformed for organizations in the world .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; they welcome transparency &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , the name of transparency , this is what is going on with the $ $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check at the <unk> of $ <unk> to fund my <unk> .
my name is <unk> .
so 18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i <unk> to the <unk> of the art . my favorite , which is also , i gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , which i can tell you , 17 very interesting , and 17 , very interesting , from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very easy to this slide and your access to it .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education of my own , i don &apos;t <unk> -- but i had to many museums and this works not access to this .
and then i went to visit to this museums , i began to learn a lot .
and while i was working on google , i tried this craving -- making art accessible -- with technology .
we then became a team , a great crew , and we began with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demo , and you just share some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can see in all this museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i even come to one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get to two ways of it -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- israeli , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you walk around and so , and they &apos;re .
you want to get in the museum ?
so you open up the map , and you jump off a click .
in fact , they want to be in the end of the gang .
just on . much fun .
they go through .
thank you , but the best thing is .
so i &apos;m a <unk> of my <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the image , click on it .
so this is one of the images .
so here are all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click on the bottom -- but i click this way .
this is one of the images we we &apos;re reflected in the so-called <unk> .
for example , this image has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people are asking me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you .
you can actually get into it and <unk> .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is a people .
but then you want to get into the inside .
and so i began to play around , and found out that there &apos;s something that is happening .
and i thought , &quot; wait , this sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the , and i realized slowly that these kids actually put something .
i &apos;ve been doing a little bit , i spoke with a few familiar , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , where a a a a a a a a a stick with a stick with a stick with a stick .
it seems quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really close to the , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the of the , i &apos;m going to see what you &apos;re going to see .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is , but in a second .
so let &apos;s jump to moma , again in new york .
another one of me , <unk> .
so , in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you want to see how van gogh this masterpiece of this masterpiece ?
you &apos;re in . you can actually go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my <unk> of this image , until i really am the cracks .
this is <unk> , probably before .
now i &apos;ll show you my favorite function .
there are many other , but i &apos;m not going time .
this is the really cool part , he &apos;s called the .
everybody -- every one -- the same is rich or your arm , whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and online your own museum -- from all those pictures , you can put your own collection .
just just , they go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> &apos; , in the <unk> .
you can put it all the things to do with things , your friends , and so a conversation , what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , i think , is the main thing that all of the wonderful stuff here isn &apos;t coming here .
they &apos;re not going to look at the museums .
i &apos;m not going to say that .
they come from the artists .
and this was a experience in humility to me .
i mean , i &apos;m hoping that we &apos;re going to be just a digital medium of art , and they &apos;re going to represent them online .
and the biggest question that i asked to ask the day is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two .
that &apos;s the left half that is the logical side , and then the right half the the intuitive side is the intuitive side .
if we had a measure of the <unk> of any of the redwood hemisphere , we could actually represent your brain .
for instance , this is somebody who is completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you get your brains on this scale ?
some of us may have been in one of those extreme , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain is about this -- with a high <unk> , the same time in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both patents or anything .
you can make logical and intuitively .
and so i &apos;m looking at as one of the individuals , and with most of the experimental <unk> , which need a good fraction of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good share of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we do this intuition ? well , we love to play things with things .
so we go out and play it and then look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
they &apos;re essentially doing the same thing .
so one of the intuitions you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing to be at the same time , it can be a place at the same time .
i mean , it can seem strange to think that one thing at the same time is in two different places , but they didn &apos;t have it , they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember a kid playing playing on a <unk> screen .
he was a toddler , and didn &apos;t get very good at it , and he fell down the time .
but i bet that it &apos;s playing with the <unk> of a very valuable lesson , which is the big things that big things we don &apos;t just go through and that they remain in a place .
and this is a great model of the world , so long they don &apos;t have a <unk> .
it would be a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a <unk> , but with these little weird particles .
and if you play with your particles , you all kinds of weird things -- how they &apos;re going directly through walls , or they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they all wrote this kind of observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics . quantum mechanics .
this was the most of the physics , a few years ago , you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little bits of tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t take them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
now , i don &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and that &apos;s probably because i don &apos;t enjoy it as many as many .
well , i &apos;m sometimes playing with them , but not quite often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one ever has a particle .
but my logical page didn &apos;t enjoy it .
because if all of the stuff that are coming out of particles and all those particles of quantum mechanics , then , not just all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it should not be like that .
so i would say , well , i would feel better with all the thing , if we could show that , <unk> also , the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago , i made this to do this .
i created one .
this is the first thing you can see , which was in the <unk> of the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;ll talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
so here i &apos;ll collapse it . we look at this right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a springboard and it &apos;s above the edge of the edge .
so i did this thing in similar ways to make a computer chip .
i went a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a <unk> for 100 hours to all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my machine machine -- to build this like a pool of a <unk> pool and get the thing to get .
this thing has been the capacity to be in the <unk> of the <unk> , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it &apos;s in an entire elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then you get to the other people and i hear all of those things because i don &apos;t want to define it , or frankly , it &apos;s <unk> .
quantum mechanics says that most of you are objects feel like .
the <unk> of these objects are not just humans , but also the light that looks at it and the wind that &apos;s over to them , and the wind that &apos;s over to them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal , we had to <unk> the whole <unk> of the whole thing .
and we did that .
we put the light , put it into a vacuum and <unk> the whole air and <unk> it up to the right , and it &apos;s just the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal , and it was
so we measured its movement .
we found that it really was weird .
instead of it is just a quiet , it &apos;s because it &apos;s the way it was <unk> , like this , like this , like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could put it to the same time and not -- -- something that only in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really awesome .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object at the same time and not to vibrate ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms from atoms are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving down and down .
just to be precise , you agree with precise <unk> .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that every atom is at two different places , which is the same that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth for all this year , because , you check that , the <unk> between an individual atom , and this piece of metal is about the same way of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of metal and you .
so if any of the atom can be in two different places , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why not they ?
i mean , this is just what my logical point is .
so , imagine you would be at the same time in many places , how would it feel like ?
how would you handle that your body &apos;s body is in the room ?
there are one more aspect of the story .
when we <unk> it , the light and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of it .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in fact , just most of the objects in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , this is not quite right .
there &apos;s more than it , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s so that these compounds , their relationships with all the things around them , literally who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be able to think about economic development .
it should be our goal , if families think about where they &apos;re going to live and work , they want to choose the opportunity to take between at least one hand of a hand of different cities that are all in competition to new people .
we &apos;re now far from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that not once you have a single city to the one that they &apos;re going to be .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much worth than it costs it to build it .
so we could actually have the world very simple , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now , this sounds may sound like that for you , if you &apos;ve never been thinking about new cities .
they &apos;re just building the building of the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in life , this already , but the other half of them are not .
they could try to expand the capacity of the existing capacity of existing .
but you know what you would be in the <unk> and whose environment can be dominated to prevent from the attacks and from the way of the .
so it turns out to be very hard to all those extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new building block , if the laws would support and not to support it .
so i suggested that governments create new areas that are enough space for a city and they gave them a name : <unk> cities .
i found out later that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of a reform for the <unk> .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 <unk> , their country , to <unk> in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and the same thing to do .
in this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens if we &apos;re a <unk> area of our country , what if we just got to be a message of the american embassy , a part of the <unk> , and if people are going to work on the surface of this messages , you can work to the <unk> of the <unk> , and if people are going to go to the surface of this messages , you can &apos;t work there , and can go to the surface of this messages , and you can go
in 2009 , i had a severe <unk> of a severe <unk> .
in the next elections election , <unk> <unk> in a turnaround whose program both innovations , and also the <unk> .
he asked to be <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared myself to tedglobal at tedglobal .
through improvement , testing and through the study of consumers , i tried to use this complicated concept of the <unk> city to essentially reduce the elements of the <unk> city .
the first point , the importance of laws is laws , which is that you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> existing information .
we &apos;re giving new technologies big , but for progress , it requires technologies and policies and it &apos;s usually laws that we can .
in the fall 2010 , a friend of guatemala <unk> the link to the tedtalk .
and this is showed him .
the two guys call me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s go to the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotel in miami .
i have to make sure how valuable cities are they are as much more valuable they are than they are .
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york : think that a area in some cases , a <unk> in some cases , per square meter of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a place than a break , said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk posed in very simple form , that a <unk> city is a place whose <unk> country is a <unk> , which is the laws that the laws of the rule that are going to be there , either of those rules , or not .
and that &apos;s why i asked from the president of the bellwether , which is that we need to realize that project is important , and that this is the way to bring our land .
i was asked to come to <unk> and to give a lecture on the fourth and fifth january .
so i have a more interesting talk to you , and i think , <unk> , that one graph as this is that it has to make a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is the new airport that built in <unk> .
in the same way , this ship has a place of 100 <unk> .
so i have to convince the <unk> of that if you want to build a new city , you want to start to start with at least 1,000 levels of <unk> .
these are more than 250 thousand acres .
polite have all the <unk> .
the face of the audience were very serious and carefully .
the manager of congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and you &apos;ve got the tedtalk .
and i &apos;m that a new city of the statement is that a new city is offering people new possibilities .
there would be the way in a city that would be <unk> in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles from the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in favor would be on the help of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could make the <unk> of the laws of the laws of the <unk> and the practice that everybody can trust that the charter is really going to be .
and the realization of president <unk> , was that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> way to get to the foreign investors to build this city for all the parties that have been in and and its fears for many years .
we &apos;re in an area .
this is this picture .
it &apos;s sort of a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , on the 19th of january , she voted on the congress for a <unk> of the constitution , which is the special <unk> of the <unk> .
in a country that has just been a comprehensive crisis , and in congress , in congress , for this <unk> , for the <unk> of the <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , they supported this .
it &apos;s to be part of the constitution , but it &apos;s going to be a twice by congress .
on the 17th , it was <unk> to a voice to a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the <unk> , , there &apos;s a european <unk> of about 30 <unk> of the world , which is most of interest in the world &apos;s business .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new urban , which in south korea was built in south asia as the center of the center .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the permits to get .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it became already two cities in china and the third one is in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s what we &apos;re standing today .
they already have a <unk> , and they think it &apos;s already a <unk> of the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that allows us to participate , and it &apos;s also working on a legal system .
a country has already been offered to provide its supreme court to provide the court for the <unk> appeal of the <unk> appeal of the <unk> .
also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even bring funding to do a .
one thing you know , you know , it &apos;s already been , you know , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are many companies that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
over the world , there are 700 million people who claim they would like to live in a different place .
a million people are leaving a year and migrate into the united states .
many of you are dads who are forced to to attach their families to become a little bit of work , and they &apos;re merely mothers who have to make enough money to eat and make eye clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , kids who are trying to find their parents and they &apos;re in some cases , in some cases , in some cases , they have no longer seen .
so what is it for an idea of thinking about how to build a whole new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of all over the world are spreading ?
so what is it for an idea of insist on that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition to new people ?
so this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from <unk> , i asked to say thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions do you do about a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a survey recently with over 2,000 american citizens and the average number of choices , the average of a typical american is a typical day , <unk> , a typical person in a day is <unk> .
and also , recently , a study of ceos did done a study of ceos in which they were watching the ceos for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different subjects that are being engaged on the <unk> of those who are doing so much time they were making decisions that are related to the issues .
and they found that an average leader in the week with <unk> tasks .
each of those issues was of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were hit by nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their choices , they needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many choices you meet in the nine minutes of the future of the future ?
how good do you think , are you making the choices of the choices ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , you &apos;re going to be , because i &apos;m blind , only your hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so my first question is , is you &apos;re willing to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> , at least at the time , it was really exclusive .
it was a place that was the <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 kinds of mustard and oil and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually got to get out of the <unk> .
i loved it to go to this business , but at a time i asked me , well , how do you get to do it , you know , you &apos;re never going to do anything ?
here &apos;s the olive olive olive olive .
they had had to be over 75 and more features of olive olive oil , including those who were embedded in boxes that came from a thousand years .
so i decided to visit the icon , and i asked the leader , &quot; work this model that you really do all of those possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the <unk> of tourists that came out and they would have their cameras in the .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose to our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gait .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we have a little <unk> on the entrance to the front of the <unk> .
we &apos;ve got six of the <unk> <unk> or 24 different pathways , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i think , would be more people standing standing and <unk> ?
it &apos;s more people standing when it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what the people were actually bought a glass of a glass .
now we saw the the opposite effect .
people who are standing than it was 24 , only three percent actually was a glass .
the people who are standing than six were six , now , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of them .
now , if you calculate it , people who are six times a glass of glass who they had six to the choices when they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide not to buy a glass glass , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> is also influenced by very meaningful decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s our own best interests .
so , the theme of the day , is going to save .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m using <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were making decisions for the pension from almost a million americans of about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of the <unk> that was possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be saved for tomorrow .
and what we found was that there was a context in fact .
so in this plans , we had about <unk> plans that people have to offer something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered , that , indeed , the active rate was lower .
now if you look at the extreme , the plans that offered the two fund , a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that almost offered 60 fund , the <unk> is now about the <unk> <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you were to participate , if more possibilities , if more possibilities , it &apos;s been , even , there &apos;s negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to participate , more , more possibilities , the more possibilities they were , the more force they were to vote and fund it .
the more ways they were , the more they were all the money in pure <unk> .
none of those extreme decisions , the choices that somebody has to be the , if we &apos;re the future resource .
now , in the last 10 years , we have seen three major consequences that are offering more and more choices .
they put the decision -- they &apos;re on , even if it &apos;s your best interest .
they make more more worse than worse -- worse resources and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more interested in things that they &apos;re less comfortable for the things that they make it more complicated .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this vast shelves of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we actually don &apos;t compare the comparison and ecosia and actually , and actually , something that can be the fantastic sale .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and at various different <unk> -- they can just use in your business .
first , just to just .
you &apos;ve heard it before before , but it was never true than today that less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; just . &quot;
they always always make it to be able to lose your <unk> .
but in truth , we &apos;re more and more that if you &apos;re ready to be ready to narrow , and the <unk> of the possibilities of the possibilities , well , there &apos;s a resource of sales , and there &apos;s a improvement of the <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble , the different <unk> and <unk> species of 26 , they had a increase in sales , they would have a increase in sales .
as the golden <unk> corporation , their 10 at the end of the <unk> , they experienced that the gains had a half percent -- a result of two , the rise of sales and reducing the cost of cost .
you know , the average economy is today , you can get to the products .
a typical wal-mart is gives you 100,000 products today .
but the most famous supermarket , the most famous supermarket in the world is <unk> , and they &apos;re just providing you 1,400 products -- a kind of a type of tomato sauce .
now in the world of the <unk> , i think one of the best examples that came out to the market , how you &apos;re best in the best possible , was something called a program that david <unk> has a very strong job , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
every single harvard employees is now now to a part of a part of the part .
those who want to meet a choice , 20 fund , 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , how people are often saying , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to just say .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i have the employees , &quot; tell me how the possibilities of each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to be able to do it , they cannot &apos;t feed their customers . &quot;
now , before we &apos;ve been today , i had a conversation with <unk> .
and he said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience a <unk> monument to the most beautiful street of the world .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the street .
and i want to read you that .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read you , and then i urge you to clap , if you &apos;re ready to take care of it .
okay . everybody who is ready to adopt the offer .
are all of that ?
okay , let me show you something more about it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i have heard more hands .
good .
in fact , it &apos;s the case of the time , the first time , but the second time , but i would make it cart that she had the second time .
because the images have been in the real mind .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between possibilities , to understand what the consequences are associated with the individuals , and that these consequences have to be <unk> and realized that the consequences of the consequences have to be .
why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent more than they &apos;re a <unk> or a credit card , than at the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s not really what we &apos;re really going to be .
and it turns out that if you make it , it feels something that feels a very good tool , so that you get more to people to save more .
so , in a study that i did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in <unk> -- employees who &apos;ve been all working for <unk> -- and those people were all in a <unk> where they were their participation for their <unk> .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting as it was , and we &apos;ve added a little bit of a little bit .
the little thing that we have to do is we asked the people to just think of all positive things that would happen in their life if they would save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a spike in participation by 20 percent , and there was a rise in the number of people who were willing to save , or a <unk> percent , the amount of four percent , the amount of money they were ready to pay for the <unk> .
the third technology : <unk> .
we can handle more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than
so here is for example , a study that we did in a <unk> in a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> down and down in the northeast area , varies the number of <unk> different kinds of magazines to <unk> <unk> .
but do you know what ?
if i show you about 12,000 magazines , and you &apos;re in 10 categories or i &apos;m giving them 400 magazines , and they &apos;re going to believe that i have given them more choices and a better <unk> than i had told you the 400 .
because the categories of what i can hold it apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left display is <unk> and the ad on your body is , you clap into the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the on the left is jazz , and the one on the right side is , then you clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to say something that is the most possible for the choices .
and this problem often happens to you , if you look at the long bullet points of all of this fund .
who do you want to do with it ?
my fourth technology : proposing for complexity .
it turns out that we can handle more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we have to get rid of the complexity .
so i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
so let &apos;s make a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here is a german <unk> that tells you the opportunity to <unk> your car completely .
they have to meet on 62 different decisions to make their car .
now , those decisions are among the number of choices that they offer per decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i do is , i change the sequence in the making the choices .
half of the customer is going to be from the many possibilities , 56 <unk> , to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customer is from the low possibilities of the , four gears , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how do they care .
if you use the <unk> of the decision , that means they &apos;re overwhelmed by them , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find is that the people who are the many of the many , and they &apos;re going to choose the <unk> .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choices to many , they &apos;re going to be .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did , is the sequence of transformation in the information .
if i start with the simple one , i &apos;m like i &apos;m <unk> .
even though , the gears , even though , you know , none of my preferences in the interior is , i &apos;m still choosing for the one .
it &apos;s also <unk> me in love with the big product that i &apos;m <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to get to be willing to be involved with interest in the .
so let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that are the problem of <unk> -- just to narrow -- you &apos;re going to get the <unk> , you know , -- you can get to more categories , less possibilities .
so , every of those techniques i &apos;m describing today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for them , they can use it for themselves , for themselves , for themselves , they can offer service for themselves .
because i think the key choice is that you &apos;re the choice of choice .
and the more we are making , the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how video can become <unk> , and then , why is important at all .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- as i was young , it seemed so hard to be so successful .
but <unk> has enabled us to all our creative operations , we can be famous to a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous to the internet until next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours a minute , there are a minute .
it &apos;s just a tiny percentage of the <unk> of the <unk> , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands and so to the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , we want to go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> , this video , he had been photographed in front of his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like when the last was popular in the first time .
actually , <unk> didn &apos;t make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do this , if you &apos;re the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
he had uploaded all kinds of <unk> .
and this is actually been sent on january in january .
what &apos;s going on here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that the video of the the next end of the end of the end of the end of the end .
because the <unk> of the jimmy <unk> presents us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . you didn &apos;t have that conversation , i hope that we would lead this conversation to speak about .
rs : &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
this is what the graph looked like .
just like &quot; double <unk> &quot; it seems to be coming from nowhere .
what &apos;s happened on this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , and many blogs started writing about it .
michael <unk> nelson was the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of theater was a very , and it was a joke on twitter .
important is that one person or a group of <unk> , a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
then , this community grew up with the big <unk> , and started to <unk> and forth with this .
now , there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single week .
unlike the <unk> of the 20th century , the part of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- or by we &apos;re going to make it out or something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s just easy .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold it crazy , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> of that , which is a <unk> , which is four million times .
even cats are looking at this video .
cats are watching cats who look at this video .
important , the creativity , which is in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
there was the .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> went from the ground , which was made of a <unk> joke to something that we &apos;re all participating .
now we don &apos;t find a look at something we &apos;re doing .
who could have predicted to anticipate ?
who would have &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; can &quot; predict <unk> &quot;
what <unk> did you have to write , where this is what it &apos;s ?
in a world where every minute two days up there is uploaded to a little days , only unique and unexpected <unk> as the previous one .
i &apos;m not interested in , i wasn &apos;t interested in a friend , i said to me this great video , a guy who &apos;s in new york on the <unk> of the world .
i got a traffic ticket because i &apos;m not on the <unk> , but often there are no hope that you can &apos;t drive the very best on the <unk> .
because it was completely surprising and humorous , and it was a <unk> funny idea , and his argument for five of time .
this approach is applies to all the new things we &apos;re creative .
and that &apos;s all leads to us a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , the features of a new form of media and culture , which is any access to each access and in the audience .
as i said , one of the most largest stars -- justin bieber -- did his start at youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green light .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our pop culture .
and those aren &apos;t the the characteristics of the old media and they don &apos;t meet in the media , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the interconnectedness between women over three generations , and how the amazing strengths of this connected to the <unk> of the interconnectedness of this connectedness of the interconnectedness of the interconnectedness of her mother and a half of her grandmother &apos;s life in a little boat . a <unk> that lived in a little boat in the chinese ocean . a labeling who lived in a little boat in the chinese ocean . a labeling who lived in a little boat in the chinese ocean . a labeling who lived in a little boat
the story is not going over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s been burning his <unk> .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose life of the simple aspiration of oneness and freedom of his home .
hold him in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the way he realizes that life was a single waste .
the words , so long , your friends , now his friends , now .
he moved to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never never forget his life .
i had to worry that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was going to be us to <unk> us , we &apos;re going to .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early days of the <unk> .
my mom may was 18 when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , with two little girls .
for her , life was given her to an task : the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely obvious that they could fail .
after an entire day , <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat to the sea as <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the most afraid they had written by pirates , rape and death .
how most adults on the boat was actually wearing a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
and in a <unk> , my sister would have been to be drinking , and i , and my grandmother &apos;s office .
my first memories are from this boat -- the elevated combustion engine of the engine , the clapping of a wave on the front lines , the vast and empty .
i don &apos;t remember the funniest thing , and the many times came , but from the <unk> of the men on our boat , or to the <unk> of the motors that didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> coast of the <unk> coast of the <unk> , and the young man who got up and died , the end of the journey was too much for him to get the the first <unk> of the the first <unk> i gave me one of the men .
no apple ever has that way .
after three months in a refugee camp we landed in the age of the .
and the next <unk> is about four generations who are building a new life together .
we we settled down in <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , whose population is made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> of the <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
the smell from the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> of the <unk> were caused by people who had one thing in common : they started beginning to rethink .
my mom worked on farms , then on a line line , in a <unk> , six days , a half .
it was kind of her time to find out , and you can get english and <unk> .
we were arm .
everybody has been assigned , and has been in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do . mostly the new stuff that came out of the next hand .
two of the <unk> for school , everybody to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because it had to be six years .
and there were the rare <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot; <unk> , goes home . &quot;
after home , where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to a <unk> and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go from the way . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i sleep in the same bed .
my mom was all the night , but we told each other from our day and heard the movements of our grandmother &apos;s house .
my mom was suffering from the boat .
and it was my job to stay up every night until your <unk> came up , so i could get them .
she &apos;s a <unk> , and then a <unk> and a a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t change the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> kids , are caught between two worlds .
loans and donors were been seeking .
there were established .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic student , the <unk> demands itself .
in the other i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the <unk> .
but so many of the things were going to help .
and because of this , i was <unk> as young <unk> of the year of the year .
and i was going to <unk> from a <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , <unk> <unk> , was now tan le , refugee and social <unk> , who had never heard of the way , and in housing , whose erection never could have imagined .
i didn &apos;t know about the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to routine to routine and the comfort of life of life , a mother , a mother and two daughters who were telling each other , and <unk> each other , and <unk> each other , and <unk> , we were still in the same bed .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do it .
she reminded me that i was as old as she was the boat .
no one was never been a option .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i spoke about <unk> and education and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people all the <unk> , so many of them did what they were doing , they lived in the borders of the possibilities .
and although i graduated from my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t take a career in law .
there was to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , <unk> in the image -- and not just , but not just , but something you have to be grateful for , perhaps a gift of the <unk> .
because the <unk> can be so easily to collapse of the horizons , so easy means that you accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve been enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world , but not as you get it .
possibilities that would not be allowed , be very specific to be very specific .
there was a energy , an <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
so i began my gut .
i collected a little team of people to me , for the <unk> , &quot; a <unk> challenge .
we had no a a year .
at the end of one of the <unk> , i tagged a huge jar of soup that we shared .
we were working until late .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i made the decision to pull in the united states .
after just a trip there .
my gut .
three months later , i was moved to the adventure .
before i &apos;m the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time in the <unk> of the social norm and the local was the most important person .
life had not been changed for centuries .
her father died soon after their birth .
her mom moved on her .
with 17 , she was the second woman to the age whose mother suggested her .
and without support of her husband , she was she ordered for a <unk> by her husband by her own , and she was in their own case , and a greater <unk> than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; be turned out to be false .
i &apos;m just in a hotel hotel in a hotel hotel in a hotel hotel in the <unk> of the room . 1,000 miles away .
i looked at the <unk> and see them on the other side .
i knew she was coming to be able to say goodbye .
my mom gave me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat in the <unk> .
we told their stories and <unk> her , we were still in her .
and after midnight , the monk and said he had to close the death .
my mom asked us to touch your hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so hot and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s been successful in this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t have the <unk> . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s the way .
you see who we were and how we created the life , we can see that the men who might come in our life , we would have been in the <unk> .
the defeat would be easy .
now i would like to have my own children , and i think of the boat .
who would ever ever want to be ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , ease , <unk> , before .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous wave of the wave , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the engine , the vast the , which is not ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this this , and you could make it safe , i would do it .
also , <unk> mother is now in the fourth or fifth .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because this is , of course , a picture that you can &apos;t absorb with your camera .
yet , my <unk> , when i was my first digital digital digital age , at the age of 15 years .
i combined with the <unk> of my own <unk> , but it was a little bit different , because it was the camera in planning in the process .
and if you put a picture of a camera , end up a camera , end up the process of the trigger .
so , for me , it seemed to be more about the right place to be at the right place to be right .
i believed , everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the trigger is going to be .
and photos like this : a a much of a much of the street .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and <unk> still , a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all of the common goal of keeping a realistic level .
when i say , when i say , i mean , i mean , i mean .
because , of course , she &apos;s not something you can actually able to capture , but i want to make it as if you can have this , in a photograph .
so , you have to think of a moment of thinking about the trick .
so it &apos;s more important to capture an idea of being an idea than a moment .
what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
does it go to the detail , or the colors ?
does it go to the light ?
what does the illusion that illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but the end of the end , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface of a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not what &apos;s realistic is , but what we think of realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take a different pieces and put together to create an alternate reality .
and let me give you a simple example .
we have three perfect objects , and we &apos;re all of the physical objects that we all can identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , combined , you can create something that looks even more in the tangible , as if it could exist .
but the same time we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we really <unk> our brains , because our brains didn &apos;t really understand that it does not make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it &apos;s really just about to combine a variety of realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about the things around us in our daily lives .
but if we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they &apos;re just going wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to do a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , none of those are not three of these .
but , you can actually combine something special about this .
so the first rule is that the <unk> photography should have the same perspective .
second , together , together , together , the same <unk> of the same .
and those two pictures satisfy those two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same <unk> .
and third is , it &apos;s impossible to tell you , where the individual images start and end by connecting them into a structure .
it &apos;s impossible to say , like this photograph was actually formed .
so by linking color , contrast and fall on the edges of the individual images , photographic <unk> , <unk> colors and dysfunction , we can see the frontiers between the different images and and so forth , we can see the frontiers between the different images and and so forth , and you can see the globe between the different images and and so forth , and you can see the boundaries of the different images and and so forth , and you can see the boundaries of the different images and and so forth , and you
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is a a landscape , and the bottom part of the .
but this image is completely composed in fact , from photographs of different places .
i personally , it &apos;s easier to create a place to create a place to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise any trade-offs in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed months to be able to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the bank bank is from another place .
the <unk> is from a quarry .
and yes , i even put the home up on the island of red to make it .
so to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s from me to be in planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then , it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of a very good deal .
and if you make good pictures , it can be pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s pretty realistic .
so , there are all the tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you about why many of the electronic <unk> failed .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped to talk to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced in the <unk> , was to take a <unk> .
and it &apos;s not particularly scientific , -- you can see a cup of coffee or tea and the patient , families , &quot; how do it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problem of why all -- maybe most of the electronic electronic insurance agencies : because we stopped listening to .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
she has a button , right .
and every morning i &apos;m going to do it .
and yes , i have a problem , as you may recognize .
i have a lot of my job at 95 pounds .
it &apos;s just easy : every time i put on the scale , you put my data on google health .
and there are also the <unk> of my <unk> , so he can see where my favorite is , and it &apos;s not just the moment where i need to support for support support , but also with a look at the past .
there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , i &apos;ve been familiar with 4,000 <unk> of twitter .
so every morning i &apos;m going to get on my <unk> and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; lunch , rather than a little salad . &quot;
but this is what it can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because it could be <unk> to obesity , or it could be able to get to patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and they can to play in common , to play their health , to control their health .
then the next week , this is the market .
it will give this little <unk> that you &apos;re going to be an iphone or so <unk> .
and it will allow people to measure home from home to the blood pressure , to send him to your doctor , and to share it with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients are coming in , they can &apos;t only take control of the time of your own ship , but also , in the health of health care , but also , in the health of health care , the challenges that are facing us , and the health care of health , and the health care of health , and the health care of health , and the health care of health , and the health care of health , and the health care of health , and the health care of health
do they make the way that are easy to use , and begin to hug it to the to give you to the team at the team .
and they can do that with such things , but also through <unk> .
and one of the things that we did , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe in our cell phone .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are in the way .
we know one , where all gas stations are .
and yeah , we can find a <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next <unk> of the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
so , what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we set up a website and a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , you &apos;re going to share with where he is when he &apos;s got , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed in the <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 , you &apos;ve been listed in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps that we could .
and we &apos;ve created a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , extended reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> are and somebody can down , you can use your iphone , and then the next weeks you can get to find the next <unk> to find the life of life .
and we &apos;re not just like to do this as a <unk> , like the product is called , but as a <unk> strategy .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us how to behave how to behave in the world , to crowdsource this <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in holiday and somebody will collapse , whether it &apos;s your own <unk> or somebody else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all over the world is given us the <unk> of these trade-offs .
these might be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still in its place .
please help us and try to take health health , but to take the hand .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to tell by unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants to make us the environment by it by it .
... it &apos;s <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take until it &apos;s actually hot .
now , we can just skip that -- i &apos;ll just skip the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , and to work in an environment , which is so pretty much what they actually hate , we have them in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> for the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to pick up some of those fellows and we &apos;re working with <unk> .
instead of them to send them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
here it looks like he looks for a date , but what it really looks like , is somebody who is him , he &apos;s <unk> because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> when he &apos;s a foot in the <unk> of a foot .
how did he look at this particular way of looking for ?
we had a team of fellows in boston in the process for america .
they were in the in february , and it has a lot of <unk> .
and they realized that the city never put these fire fire .
but one particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , and that was the fact that the inhabitants were the <unk> of the sidewalks , right from the <unk> .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire hydrant .
you &apos;re <unk> to him , if it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , it can take someone away from somebody else .
so there &apos;s a nice little game .
this is a humble app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the <unk> apps that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones in the last year .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do a different <unk> .
it spreads out .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> of the city of the city , which is that he could use this app , not for snow , but to the citizens of the citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people are stealing the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then she decided to use seattle to use the app to get the citizens to get the <unk> .
and chicago , they &apos;re just introduced to the <unk> , and it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> , when it &apos;s <unk> .
now we &apos;re now going to know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it has spread to spread , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it &apos;s not going to be that way .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that last year at a project in boston , for three people needed a half months .
it was about a way of trying to find out what the the right public schools for their kids .
and we told us later that if it would go over the normal mountain , it would have taken over two years and it would have been over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not something .
there are now a project in the silicon valley , which cost the taxpayers have been two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at any level of the government .
so an app that is written in a few days , and then from <unk> , is a kind of shot in front of the bow of the bow .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a personal company , how many people think they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather than the internet itself .
and that means free access to the meaning open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important about this app is that it represents a new generation , the problem of government -- not as the problem of an extrovert institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it shows that we &apos;re very well in the collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who are the tools we need to do to tackle things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are up up and writing , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re dreadful with her , but they don &apos;t complain about them , they repair them .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all your feelings about politics and the snake in the <unk> and all the other things that we really upset about , is government , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; which we do not do . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m you you &apos;re going to get on the front of it , because the things are changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally , their power of us is to us -- <unk> : &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about how that change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , in the government , is that people are mainly able to choose office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve been to realize that it &apos;s especially in the local community to go to the <unk> .
this is the call of service and information .
there &apos;s usually in your town , if you &apos;re <unk> in your city .
if you have to have the chance to work in your <unk> call call , how our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , do you all do that -- you will see that people who are the government for many different problems , including that a <unk> in your house is in your house .
so scott gets this <unk> .
he &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have a idea . he begins with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open up all the doors in your house and see it very loud , and see if the cattle ? &quot;
and this worked . applause of scott .
but this wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
now , boston , not only a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t written this app .
this is the work of a very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- this is in fact : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> , can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott <unk> to human <unk> .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all the public , so that everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we got was , &quot; i went over there , and i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . living ?
and the <unk> goes on the page . went home .
good night , honey <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s digital physical physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the balls of the .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i mean , not necessarily , a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help himself and help others .
a citizens helped another citizen , but the government was a central role here .
they were both of these two people .
and you could have to connect them with government , if they had to be that , but a neighbor is a better and <unk> alternative to national service .
when a neighbor neighbor of the other , we &apos;re our communities .
let &apos;s get the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think about it is that government isn &apos;t like politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input from the other .
that our contributions to the system is .
how many people have been elected a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re expecting to expect that the government , and we expect that the government , our values and our needs , and then not have a lot of change ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a more ocean and politics is the top .
and what is underneath , is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have , and we pay for the , something that we &apos;re doing , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think of politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because this is where the actual <unk> is happening .
we have to be on the government of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
have you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned , which is a very detailed <unk> report , which is an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not politically active , which is <unk> active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we &apos;re thinking about the world that we want to leave our kids .
you have to introduce you the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really believe that we can reach what we need to do , without improving an institution that can be in the name of us all ?
and a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is possible that technology is possible , the function of the government is fundamentally able to achieve something that is actually able to achieve something that is actually able to achieve the society .
and there is a generation that has grown up the <unk> internet , and the knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows are 28 , so i &apos;m , sadly , almost one of them are older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with this , their voice as granted .
they don &apos;t struggle for the battle that we all struggle to talk about who is talking to who are talking to who are talking to who are allowed to speak .
you can make your mind , to every time , and they can do it every time and they do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t take care so much to use your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that we have the work of the government .
and these apps allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be , a fire fire <unk> , weeds , a trash garbage trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash .
and sure , we would have these <unk> <unk> , and many people do this .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers the government to pay the taxes and receive performance .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve government , until we &apos;re going to improve the same .
so the question i &apos;ve all here is , if it &apos;s about the big , important things we have to do , all together we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
it &apos;s usually a role in explaining to people how wonderful the new technologies are the emergence of being , and i thought i &apos;m here with my friends , i would tell you what i really do .
i &apos;m going to start with you just to just to be a single clip slide .
... could you show the slide for a moment .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen to my name project .
it &apos;s not about the detail of the slide , but rather the overall shape .
this slide shows data from us about the performance of <unk> processors compared to the power of a <unk> area .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like , as many of the others that we often find in our field , a kind of just a kind of just on a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is an <unk> in the <unk> .
and that &apos;s a novelty that we have to use this guy on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back .
and even a little bit brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on paper .
now , why do we draw on the <unk> curves in the <unk> curves ?
the reason is , if i put it on a normal curve , where we &apos;re looking at this , the timeline , the timeline of a kind , and this is an endangered species of the technology that i want to represent with a graph , then the graph is silly .
so , they &apos;re looking like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
so if i want to record a different technology , we &apos;ll say a <unk> , then it would be very <unk> , in form a <unk> line .
but if something like this happens , this is what the most important things changes .
so if the <unk> of the <unk> , as fast as the <unk> progression , we could get into a taxi and in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but this is not so fast .
there was never before in the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is the scale of the increase for a few years .
so the question i want to ask you to ask you , if you look at this exponential curves , you can &apos;t go on it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s all possible forever , and it &apos;s going to be very fast as now as now .
there are two possibilities .
it &apos;s either a classic <unk> of the way here , to something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
this is in about .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
so this is really , then , we &apos;re here right now in a transition moment .
we are here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new way of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i think often , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new condition that the world is slow down ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a kid somewhere in the year 2000 and people often talked about what would happen to happen in the year 2000 .
now , we have a conference where people are talking about the future and you realize that the future remains still in the year 2000 .
so on than we don &apos;t go .
so in other words , the future has been since i &apos;ve been in the world .
i think the reason is that there &apos;s something that is happening .
the transition is happening . we can all feel .
and we know that it &apos;s just not going to make sense of trying to look at the future , or 50 years to the future , because it &apos;s going to be so different from what we don &apos;t do .
now , i want to talk about what this might be , that transition that we &apos;re in the moment .
so , to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some of the other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i think that really understand this , we have to go back and look at the thing on a longer spectrum of a longer .
and i want to look at this on the earth &apos;s life on earth &apos;s life .
i think the big picture is sense of making sense of it into a few <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and that is an 2.5 billion years , earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with many of them .
so if you look at the way that chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good image about how it was the <unk> .
i think there are theories that are starting to understand how to do everything with rna rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of <unk> of chemicals .
some of these <unk> in these <unk> , a particular combination of chemicals that allows them to integrate other chemicals from the outside , and to grow .
everybody who were so , began to be .
these little <unk> were the <unk> <unk> .
but these are not about being alive in the current sense , because every single one was just a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , they have <unk> into the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
so every one was a little bit different .
in fact , the <unk> , which had been a <unk> for growth , and they had more and more chemicals from the outside , and they turned off faster .
so this is the most effective , and it &apos;s the same thing to survive longer , and it &apos;s the same thing in <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interesting it will be a trick of an abstraction .
in some ways , one way we don &apos;t understand understand , this <unk> , the ability to learn , information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , they have been in this <unk> , evolutionary way of them , which allowed them to pull together , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store , over 2.5 billion years where they came in , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , which exactly the same code and the same notation .
and every thing that is exactly the same letters and the same code .
we are , we &apos;re just to the <unk> , and we can write the code of this code .
and i have a hundred <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to hold in the airports from <unk> .
in the inside of it , i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to the <unk> -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written it 10 22 times .
so if someone wants to <unk> a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for anybody in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in fact , i would have been a <unk> , then i would have written on a virus and put it into the room .
so what is the next step ?
the <unk> of the dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- they made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that began to communicate these cells and information so that communities emerged from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but they can actually share their dna .
so , this is why the analytical of the consistency is growing up too antibiotics .
some bacteria figured out how they can stay from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate .
now , these communication allowed the reasons of communities , which was in a sense of the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survive , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated and from the evolution .
now , the <unk> is now where those communities are so close to the <unk> of the recipe for the whole community to write in a <unk> .
and the next interesting thing was about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities from many <unk> <unk> , which together as individuals .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked for themselves .
your skin cells are useless , or heart cells , cells cells , cells cells and so on .
so these communities began to be <unk> , so that the stage was happening , which is the only single cell , but the whole thing we call the organism .
the next step was happening in this communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that were doing nothing else , as information in the organism .
and these are the neural structure .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have been constructed this <unk> .
they started train in specialists in the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and the possibilities of information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning now , within the span of the average of the average of the single organism , rather than that evolutionary length of time .
so an organism could learn to be a certain fruit of fruit , because she was bad , and it was sick , the last time he had eaten .
now , this was now happening within the lifetime of one organism , but before hundreds of years ago , because this information has been learned to be learned from the individuals who died because of those of those crops died because of those crops were not there .
so the nervous system has the <unk> of this particular <unk> , because evolution could now take place within an individual .
it was able to take place in a time of time .
what happens after that , the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
so , as example , the <unk> of the <unk> of this <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention , if you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically taking <unk> sound of me in the hope that it &apos;s a similar to create a similar idea of the way in your head that has a resemblance to my original idea .
so we take a little bit of a very complicated , it changes in sound , a sequence of sound , and produce a little bit very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to do it as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we have the human , we have to abstract .
we &apos;re the same steps that have been through the <unk> -- the owners of our methods of how we capture data .
the invention of the language was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on , all our own biomedical mechanisms that we built in our community to be able to handle this information .
and it unites us all together , which is much bigger , and we can continue to develop faster and more and more and more than we were .
so nowadays , evolution can happen in the span of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen <unk> little <unk> , where he has a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , directly before your eyes .
so we have the <unk> again .
the first step of the story that i told you , <unk> a billion years per piece .
the next steps , as the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a few hundred years .
then the <unk> steps , as a language and so on , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be a few decades .
the process is <unk> itself and becomes , and it &apos;s , i think , <unk> is the word for it -- if something its <unk> is .
the more changes it changes , the faster changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that lives from itself .
i live in building a living , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i use to build computers , not to use , without having a recent advance of the technology .
my current activity is to design objects with such a very large complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what any single transistor in the <unk> is doing .
it has billions of those .
what i do , and what the designers of thinking is <unk> , is , we think of a conscience , the this machine and the machine is something that we could do , and the machine is something that we could ever do .
and it &apos;s doing it partly with the amount of things that we don &apos;t even understand .
a method that &apos;s particularly interesting is , and i &apos;ve been using it lately , is the evolution itself .
and in doing this , we put a <unk> in the machine , which is going on in the <unk> .
so , for example , to give an example , in most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s made of random entities .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , a hundred million randomly randomly randomly randomly randomly randomly randomly randomly randomly randomly randomly .
now , please , please , please , please , please , please , all of these randomly chosen , are going to be , and then pick the people who are my <unk> . &quot;
so in other words , i want to say what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want numbers , that would be a simple example of which i &apos;ve been using it .
so , what &apos;s the most important numbers can be able to be able to figure out the most important numbers .
of course , the chance of random chosen to be chosen , is very tiny , that it &apos;s just numbers , so , don &apos;t actually do this .
but one of them may have two numbers in the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , you have the people 10 percent of the sequence that my <unk> are going to be .
they would lay down , <unk> , the rest .
now , all the <unk> , all the <unk> , which is the numbers .
and with a method of <unk> , ahmadinejad to the reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children by the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids are the properties of the <unk> of the two programs of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that are in the way of combinations of programs that are closer to the <unk> of the things that are closer to the <unk> .
tell , &quot; please repeat .
<unk> them again .
now , a few mutations .
and even again , again , again , again with another generation .
all those generations need only few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a million of years in the computer in a few minutes , or in more complicated cases .
finally , i get the programs that can sort of get the numbers of the numbers .
in fact , these are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever write by hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
it &apos;s ridiculous and weird programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure that they do the job because they &apos;re from a series of <unk> programs that do the job .
because their lives depended on whether they were doing the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , <unk> , he <unk> a card , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s the airplane of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which together work together to make their flight safer . don &apos;t make you <unk> ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal , when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start to rely on computers , for a process that is a very different way of doing .
he allows us to make things with a much higher complexity than it would be the normal way to produce .
and yet we understand the possibilities of this .
so , <unk> <unk> is the technique .
we use those things to make the computers much faster , so we can do able to do this process even faster .
so there &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s going to go faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so puzzling .
because all these new technologies are going to be on themselves .
we &apos;re going to raise .
we &apos;re at a point that is analogous to the time when they evolved to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really see what the hell we &apos;re actually creating in the building .
we are the middle of this <unk> .
but i really think that &apos;s going to be something .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> of us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all here , part of the creation of the creation of what &apos;s going to be next .
well , the lunch is before , and i &apos;m going to say i &apos;m going to stop here before i &apos;m going to be .
my story begins in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was in the middle of the <unk> of the desert , <unk> ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we were to go to the , we were in a car and <unk> across the skies .
now we do this with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took a bow , and he went into the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced with machines .
that really made me sad .
i was a bit of a fear of technology .
it was me that i could lose the ability to be able to get rid of the sunset , the sunset , without a camera , without any tweet to my friends .
i thought that technology should be possible , and not killing .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became an <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and to the pictures of my imagination .
i felt like that , as we did our <unk> and cameras of it to dream of it .
they were being inspired by being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to be magic to it .
with 16 , i began to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device that can connect readers to the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s taking pictures and text , and animation , sounds and touch .
it &apos;s a lot of the same way .
but what do we do ?
now i &apos;m just going to be able to be able to be an interactive ipad app .
here says , &quot; put your finger on each light . &quot;
and so -- here , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i &apos;m betting my name .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad white , i &apos;m going to do -- -- that &apos;s right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about this .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about the magic .
i don &apos;t mean , and dragons , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all have as kids .
fireflies in a glass , i was always very exciting .
so you have to get the same out of the the the the the the the the the the the the the same way .
and the light bulb light the way through the book .
another idea that i became fascinated as a kid , is that a whole single galaxy can be in a single single single day .
and therefore , every book , and every world is a little bit of a little <unk> that i &apos;m here to highlight the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
they &apos;ve been making maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and <unk> and serve the <unk> of the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also showing you on other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to go here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
we all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people know outside of the world , their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught in <unk> rooms in <unk> , in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary history of children .
a story that deals with new issues as the <unk> .
the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are in their dorm rooms , they &apos;re in their dorm rooms , no .
but now , with a little bit of a portable technology , we can take our kids in the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of book , you &apos;re going to go to a quest to go out and and with the camera of the ipads images of natural objects .
as a kid i had collections of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is <unk> . you have to go out to make a photograph in a chapter a photograph of a flower .
in a different chapter you have to take a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you actually create digital collection collection of photos that you can then ask online .
a kid in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i have seen a monkey . &quot;
it creates a sort of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there are a number of possibilities of ways to connect the world and technology .
so in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction where you use the video of the ipads and through the <unk> reality , which is a <unk> of <unk> , which is on a plant .
in a place , the screen corresponds to the screen .
you have to make the sound sound of the <unk> , you blow the rest of the book .
we all are moving to a world where the natural forces of the technology is coming and and technology can be .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and we closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood is through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a very amazing honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prison or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the most of the most vulnerable weakest in the <unk> and places where there are very much in the most banal .
so here at ted , to see how powerful that is , i &apos;ve given me a lot of power .
in the short time , i got a clear : ted has an identity .
you can say things that are the world influence .
and sometimes when something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and force that it didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m saying that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen a few amazing presentations .
i think we have learned that the words of a teacher has meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher teacher will be particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . but as a doctor doctor , but you can do more .
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t actually work in my work as a lawyer .
i &apos;ve learned that from my grandmother &apos;s grandmother .
i became large in a family , a traditional <unk> household , which was dominated by a <unk> of a <unk> , and this was my grandmother &apos;s <unk> .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , it had influence .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the beginning of a lot of differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as a slave .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery formed a lot of the world &apos;s view .
my grandmother was very , but she was also loving .
if i met them as a little boy , she came to me and i was me .
and she pushed me so that i could barely breathe breathing . then let me go .
one of a , two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; whoa , feeling my hug my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; <unk> , i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she would me quiet me .
she was something that was made , that you were always trying to be in their nearby .
the only problem was that she had 10 kids .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her time , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins were around around .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , i &apos;ve got one morning in the morning and put into the living room , all my cousins were around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and i was staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and she was smiling , but she looked very seriously .
this was 15 or 20 minutes . she stood up and came over to me , and she came up with me , and i said , &quot; come on my hand and said , &quot; come on the hand and i said , &quot; come on the hand . you and i have to talk . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise you you &apos;re not going to be . &quot;
i said , &quot; promise , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and i looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve observed you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything what you want to do .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to be just three points , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , &quot; first , i told you that you &apos;re always going to love your mom always .
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to be able to get you to take you . &quot;
i mean my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , feminine , i &apos;ll do . &quot;
then she said , &quot; next <unk> me , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
i thought , &quot; yes , &apos;am . i promise it .
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is &quot; you never will drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , gee . i promise it .
i grew up on the country , the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s a year older and one year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother , home , and took this <unk> beer with grabbed my sister and me and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just as as as we can .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister one , and she took them , and then offering me one .
i said , &quot; no , no . you know , no . it &apos;s just . i don &apos;t want to drink a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do you do this , you know , we &apos;re doing this , you know , you &apos;re doing anything we do .
i had what , your sister had a beer . go to a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do . it &apos;s just . it &apos;s just .
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what is .
then he looked at me and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t do you still , crazy , because of the conversation ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all the grandchildren that they are special .
i was destroyed the floor .
i &apos;ll give you something to you .
i should not think that .
this is maybe in the public domain .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and i &apos;m <unk> that i never drunk one drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> , and i &apos;m saying that because identity means .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell us things that they don &apos;t think they don &apos;t .
we can get them to do things , they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all your grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in the prison of prison .
my uncle died in <unk> diseases .
and they believed that this was the issues that we have to take care of us .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in jail .
today , there are 2.3 million .
the united states have the largest world &apos;s largest world &apos;s largest world .
seven million people are <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
i think , in my opinion , we have changed our world .
in social weak and black parts of the population of despair and hopelessness , because of those changes .
one of three male black , between 18 and 30 is in jail , in jail , in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities , across los angeles , the <unk> to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black men in prison , in jail , on the <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
but our system is not just being formed by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also deformed by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that you can much better than you are rich and comfortable with your arm and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , it affected the outcome .
yet we seem to be very happy with it .
a politics of fear and anger , we convinced ourselves that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost the contact .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
there are some of the most dramatic things .
my home home , my home home , <unk> , <unk> , if you &apos;re being arrested .
here , in alabama , 34 percent of the male &apos;s male population are losing their <unk> .
we <unk> that 10 years of the <unk> of the civilian cities are so high as high as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , teaching children &apos;s death in jail .
in this country , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , no more than <unk> .
we have a lot of work on this .
the only country of the world .
i &apos;m <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
we believe that because you taught us that the real question is : has a man deserves to die for a man &apos;s <unk> crimes ?
it &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not , anybody for a crime , but , &quot; have we earned it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty death penalty is characterized by error .
on nine people we have executed , we &apos;re one of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and from death death .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never fly someone with an airplane , if nine planes , the <unk> , the <unk> .
but somehow we can do it , we &apos;re going to get from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we &apos;re right to kill the right .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m a professional story of <unk> . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time of the <unk> , until the beginning of the second world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the african-american man in this country was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that has formed their life .
these older people are now to me and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking , they tell people that we &apos;re going to stop saying that we &apos;re going to stop saying that we &apos;re going to stop saying that we &apos;re going to stop .
they say , &quot; no , tell the people that we grew up with this .
and after that terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> <unk> <unk> and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there are a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions did in the historical context .
we &apos;re always protesting .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not going to be able to get us the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> cannot be able to solve the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
in the genocide , in rwanda , it was these willingness , but not in this country .
i have a couple of lectures in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up to my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly disturbing to hear that way . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death penalty .
and of course , they can never give more . &quot;
it &apos;s got a silence , then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;re ever killing ourselves again for the systematic to kill the systematic .
it would be <unk> of us , and we &apos;re <unk> and breeding people .
i thought about it .
how it would feel like , in a world where the german state of people were <unk> , especially if there were a lot of jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states , we &apos;re looking at people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of the death , 11 times more than the victim is white , and the victim is white , when it &apos;s black .
and yet , there are this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t care about it , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and all of creativity .
we love entertainment .
but then finally , these realities of suffering , <unk> , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i seem to be important to unite both .
because we finally talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more devotion to be in a complex world .
for me , time means to think of time and talk about the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
but think of a way that we &apos;re in our own life .
we all have to believe in the end of the things we cannot see .
we do this . so we are so rational , so we &apos;re very much value .
innovation , creativity , and development , not just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i think it &apos;s not just open to the bright and <unk> things , but also the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politician , once said , &quot;
when we were in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed was , was a , a mental <unk> , the willingness to be able to be able to be in places in <unk> places .
this mental orientation is the core of what i think is that the need to be engaged in this .
there are no technology for technology and design that allows us to be human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears have <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges much more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to touch them profoundly .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m the great privilege to meet pink parks .
and again , again , back to <unk> , where they were two of their oldest friends , the older ones , <unk> <unk> , who had the <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white person , dr. king <unk> .
so these women met and they were just a .
and i called , and he said , &quot; <unk> , woman comes into the city . we want to talk to .
do you want to be <unk> and listening ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what will you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i heard just .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day i was sitting there , and i heard these women , and after a few hours , a woman turned to me , &quot; well , tell me what the means for the same .
what do you do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
<unk> wants to help people who were convicted of innocent .
we want to fight for the <unk> and discrimination of the <unk> .
we want to abolish <unk> <unk> , without any <unk> of children .
we want to do something about the death penalty company .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
we want to abolish <unk> .
i thought my usual lecture , and then she looked at me and she said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to do very , very tired . &quot;
then he rejected a little finger on me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted ted ought to be .
we need to be able to ask ourselves to the challenges of this , those problems , that suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity , our humanity .
in my work , i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a few very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every people on the planet .
if somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone take something that doesn &apos;t heard him , he &apos;s not just a <unk> .
somebody who kills someone , not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , there &apos;s a fundamental human being , which has to respect the law .
i also think that in many parts of this country , and with certainty in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think in a lot of places the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so inspiring , and inspiring , and so stimulating , we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not the things we &apos;re developing , not our intellect and minds .
finally , a society doesn &apos;t see how they treat their rich and powerful and powerful , but it &apos;s how they handle how they handle with the poor , the death penalty , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing thing that makes us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story .
sometimes i urge to do too .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes they are so <unk> ideas of our thinking , in very important ways .
i <unk> these kids who were convicted of a very rough definition .
i go to the <unk> and visit a client to be the 13 or 14 years , and to be the an adult court .
i &apos;m asking , how could this happen ?
how can a judge someone into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a kid .
one night i stayed at a long time and thought , my goodness , if a judge could turn us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should have something like .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think of it right , i began to work on a bill .
i had a <unk> , poor black boy as a customer .
and i started to <unk> with this bill , the headline was : &quot; bill , my poor , <unk> black , like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> .
in my astonishment , i told that <unk> <unk> and the police and <unk> are being able to be .
there was a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a <unk> , that there is only error .
the next morning i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i was just to <unk> these crazy bill or actually written .
and to my astonishment , i didn &apos;t have it just written , but also sent to court .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and i got to go to the crazy case .
i went into the car and really , really , really , really , overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car and went the stairs up to court .
when i was the staircase to court , an older man , black man , the ambulance .
when he saw me , he came back to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and i was <unk> .
then he throws my ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched a little bit of me in me , identity , the ability to contribute to any one of the individual , to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
and as soon as the judge .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have you asked this crazy unthinkable ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and we began to discuss .
and more people come in , just because they were angry .
i had this crazy thing .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry at the skin of skin color , over the poverty , about inequality .
i saw the <unk> and go down .
he always saw her through the window and i could hear the whole thing of the whole thing .
he went on and down .
finally , this man came black man with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat straight behind me , almost to the <unk> .
10 minutes later , the judges announced a break .
during the break , a <unk> , the <unk> was the <unk> in the <unk> .
this <unk> <unk> ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the old black man stood on . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m a little man to say , you don &apos;t give the goal .
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral anatomy of the universe is far , but that the justice is <unk> .
we &apos;re not fully evolved than humans , unless we don &apos;t care about human rights and care .
that our survival is survival to survive .
that we have to create our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity , with humanity , pity and justice .
and , in most of , i want to see those of you that are seeing that , just don &apos;t end the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give it .
you have to have this audience , this community , a very <unk> wish , and it &apos;s a , and it &apos;s to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring , where it &apos;s about , actually , a effort , something from the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
here , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to have a billion dollars for the death penalty for a billion dollars for the death penalty .
and yet , 46 percent of all the <unk> of the <unk> .
56 percent of all the <unk> don &apos;t come before .
here is the chance of doing something .
this is a <unk> that will be proposing to invest money into more sustainable and security .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the average of america is in america .
this fact is often going to be in a context with elevated <unk> .
what would you say that that believes ?
now , in fact , the number of the <unk> didn &apos;t change very much .
most of the <unk> of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t actually actually in the classroom .
it was the <unk> <unk> of drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come in the prisoners .
we have <unk> <unk> from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now we have <unk> <unk> , the people are always bringing up behind bars for a <unk> , for the theft , for the theft , , rather than you force it to give the things to the sacrifice .
i think we have to do more to help people who have become a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current doesn &apos;t help anybody to do .
i think that &apos;s what we need to do .
<unk> , they actually put a string of metabolism .
they &apos;re a inspirational personality .
thank you for ted , thank you very much .
bin laden &apos;s born is a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> in somalia . it &apos;s a <unk> .
four : <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s dangerous . dangerous .
six : social degradation . it &apos;s seven : 65 dead deaths .
8 : <unk> . 5,000 : <unk> <unk> .
different speaker : <unk> . <unk> .
recession . a <unk> . egypt .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so , these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve been collecting over the last six months -- it would have been the last six months , or the last six years .
in fact , the media prefer to show us negative issues , because our minds are just given attention to the attention .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for it .
every second every one day , our senses are going to start with much more information than our brains .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival is the first stop for all the information that the the is part of our <unk> , the the the sky .
so the the the is our early warning systems , our <unk> .
it <unk> and <unk> the whole information on the quest to be in the way of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look at the negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , the demand , &quot; is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that we seven days 24 hours a day , 24 hours a day , all of these negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe this is the reality .
maybe it &apos;s the vast progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so much that it &apos;s possible in the next three decades of creating a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big deal -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we are much better at the very long term , but they finally , but they &apos;re going to end up to the end .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can foresee the development .
in the last hundred years , average expectancy is more than doubled , which is the inflation , the world &apos;s <unk> .
child mortality has reduced to a tenth of a tenth .
and that is that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a half of a half .
steve pinker have shown us that we currently live in a very recent period of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> rate is up 80 percent over 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we act upon poverty .
think , a large percentage of americans who are living below poverty poverty , access to electricity , toilets , <unk> , tv , <unk> , <unk> and cars .
the richest <unk> of the last century , the earth &apos;s <unk> of the earth , would never have such a dream of life .
the basis for a lot of them are producing technologies , and they &apos;re growing up .
my good friend kurzweil kurzweil has given us that every tool that &apos;s going to become the information technology , the <unk> of moore &apos;s great jumps , and the <unk> is all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and a half thousand times less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things about this curve .
first , how smooth it takes -- in good time , war , or peace , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
it &apos;s not slow down for none of our big problems .
also , despite your heartbeat , on the left , it &apos;s up up the up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a number of big technologies that are available to all .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that my friends are called &quot; <unk> , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , robots , the <unk> , which is to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> , and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have heard the defeat of <unk> <unk> watson of <unk> <unk> ?
that was great .
i &apos;ve taken the newspapers and the best headlines i could find out of the best headlines i could .
i love this : &quot; well , 99.9 <unk> of human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would have given each owner to the .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m at ted a new university called &quot; globalized . &quot;
we bring our students all these technologies , with focused on how this is used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , businesses , products and services , which can be able to create a decade of life .
think about that a group of students can change life today lives .
thirty years ago , this was ridiculous .
today , we can actually predicted to the dozens of companies that we did .
if i think of it , i mean , i don &apos;t mean life for any of the planet on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating a <unk> goods of creating <unk> .
scarcity is that <unk> , and technology is a resource of force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he took the king of <unk> dinner dinner dinner .
<unk> soldiers received <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> .
the king of <unk> came .
aluminum was at this time the most valued metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome of the <unk> of the <unk> of aluminum made .
although aluminum is <unk> percent of the <unk> , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
it will be connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of the <unk> and made it so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
so let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we think of <unk> today .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet that &apos;s more energy than we use a year .
16 <unk> energy energy <unk> all the 88 minutes on the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the millennium -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar power is about 50 percent .
last month , this is published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade , the <unk> areas of the united states of six cents per square cents in the national arctic , compared to 15 cents at 15 cents at the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll have the water in the surplus .
talk about <unk> .
remember , as a gentleman , as a gentleman , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was going back to saturn &apos;s <unk> , back to the earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it say ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s over to 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent seawater , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting to 0.5 percent of the water on planet planet , but there is hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation with dean <unk> , one of the innovators of the doing it , i want to share with you -- -- -- he gave me the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and many of you may have heard about it . it has the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can create a thousand gallons of clean water per day from different sources -- whether it &apos;s seawater , polluted water , <unk> , and all of those for less than two cents per gallon .
the king of coca-cola has just been <unk> , a large <unk> of a hundred units in developing countries .
and if all of it comes up , and i &apos;m very comfortable , then it will apply this technology globally to the world &apos;s global countries on the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that we &apos;re today .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
you know , my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile mobile phone in developing countries to the end of of of the .
just think of a <unk> cell phone in the middle of kenya , a better <unk> than president <unk> 25 years ago .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has been information and communication in the surplus of no one could have predicted .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent a thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , and the <unk> , and the music to medical imaging -- are now going to be <unk> and cheaper in their mobile phone .
and the best thing is that , perhaps , in the realm of us in health .
last month i had the pleasure , with the <unk> , the $ $ 10 million <unk> prize prize prize , the <unk> prize .
we &apos;re asking , we &apos;re asking , to get together all these technologies in a cell phone , and to connect to the device , because it &apos;s with ai , you can actually test your <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , it needs to be a better diagnostic than a team of physicians .
imagine this device before a developing country where there are no doctors , but it &apos;s 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the <unk> staff of health care .
if this device is a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , it &apos;s the <unk> and prevents a pandemic before it burst .
but now , the biggest force that we &apos;re going to do is a world of abundance .
i &apos;ll call &quot; the coming billion .
the white lines are the population .
we just crossed the <unk> .
and just , the largest <unk> against a population explosion is a better education and diet all over the world .
in 2010 , we had now connected to two billion people , and they were connected .
by 2020 , we get to five billion <unk> of two to five billion .
three billion new heads , we never heard before , and then the global communication is going to join .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what are you going to want ?
and instead of post-conflict gridlock i see one of the biggest economic history of the story .
these people are the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world &apos;s economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the use of the <unk> , and they &apos;re getting better in the <unk> , and by the way that they &apos;re having the opportunity to use 3d printers and <unk> computing , and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated members of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ?
what about a phrase , it &apos;s never been before the voices .
how would it be the oppressed , wherever they are , to make a voice to make it possible and change , for the first time ?
what are going to bring those three billion people ?
what about <unk> that we can &apos;t predict ?
one of the things i learned by the x prize is that little teams that are driven by passion and focus , making extraordinary things that are large businesses and governments could only create the past .
i want to finish with a story that i really excites me .
there is a program that some may already know .
it &apos;s a game that is called the degradation .
it was developed in the university of washington .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids , to explore how the protein develops .
the way we can predict how to do the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university university .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that the human pattern is the human pattern of the protein than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who the best <unk> of the world was not a <unk> , not a <unk> , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was in a <unk> of the world , and at night , the best part of the world was .
ladies and gentlemen , what is given me to our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to ask us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online , to master the new challenges , and to do what needs to do .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to have a little bit of a long-term piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough in the business as i can give it a piece of my own <unk> of my own <unk> to make this .
but before i &apos;m to my talk , i &apos;m going to start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the <unk> and we &apos;re moving to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears coming to the statistics and and to use this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to suggest that i &apos;m hoping that most of you have heard of that .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat was 300 .
that means that the player &apos;s definitely going to be three of 10 .
this is the ball of the <unk> , he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not caught , and who the ball tries to throw the ball to the first time , it didn &apos;t have time , and the <unk> was in safety .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to put a <unk> in <unk> baseball baseball ?
all right , really well , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> game ?
this is somebody else &apos;s worth of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams , the last <unk> baseball player of baseball player , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> season over 400 time .
so let &apos;s back back to my world of medicine , which i &apos;m going to feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little bit more comfortable with them .
suppose you have a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be a <unk> , which is 400 400 in terms of <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a particular remote neighborhood , and they got a very trained people with <unk> <unk> and their <unk> <unk> of this one , which is <unk> at <unk> .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s much better than it . it &apos;s on the <unk> .
and she &apos;s a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think about the <unk> of a <unk> or a nurse , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all of all medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor , should be .
what we do is we &apos;re in any of them , including me to the world , to be perfect .
never do a mistake , no one but no one but the details of how this is to be .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a <unk> <unk> student .
in high school , a <unk> said that brian <unk> would learn to a <unk> .
and that &apos;s what it was .
and i learned to the <unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> , at the <unk> of the war , <unk> of here .
i learned everything memorized .
in my graduate school , i learned the origins and the tail of any <unk> , every one of the artery , which is the <unk> of the ascending <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;ve been collecting more and more knowledge .
and i was fine , i was <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical school , the idea i knew all of it , and i knew anything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , as close as possible , i &apos;m immune to the making possible for making errors .
and it worked for a time until i met a little bit of a .
i <unk> in a <unk> here in toronto , as a woman , a woman &apos;s hospital in the hospital hospital .
at that point , i was the <unk> of the <unk> service .
and it was my mission of being <unk> <unk> , looking for the <unk> of the study .
and i &apos;m going to give my <unk> .
i studied a lot of a designer and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her , she made sound sounds .
and when i was her breast her breast , i could hear a <unk> sound sound to the two sides , which said that she was under <unk> heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart failed , instead of pumps the entire blood , you &apos;re going to turn a part of the blood vessels in your lungs and filling it up , so that &apos;s where the <unk> came .
and it wasn &apos;t a hard to diagnose .
i put it , and i got to the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so that they were the fluid .
and over a time of a half , to two hours , they began to feel better .
i felt really well .
and i made my first mistakes ; i sent them home .
actually , i did two mistakes .
i sent them home to my <unk> , and i &apos;m talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take on lying and did what i would have a call on my <unk> , and he would have been a chance to make a chance to make a image .
and he knew her , he had able to get the other information to your <unk> .
maybe i did it with a reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed so successful and able to take responsibility that i was so much and so i would be able to get contact for my patients .
my second mistake was worse .
and by doing that , i sent them home , i &apos;m a quiet voice in me , trying to say , &quot; the <unk> , not good idea . do it . &quot;
in fact , it was so much about me that i asked the the nurse , which is the woman , and you know it &apos;s fine when she goes home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go . &quot;
i remember it as it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> and they took them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i would go to the hospital , and went to the car park to the car to go home with the car to the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t do .
i went through the <unk> on my way home .
and there was a other nurse , not the sister who had been seeing the <unk> , but another three words to me and those three words , most of the most favorite i know .
other doctors are afraid of this , but the most important thing is particularly because we see the patients so 380,000 .
the three words say : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients she &apos;s thought ? &quot;
i asked the nurse .
so , &quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she went home , after i sent her home , she was her and the family called 911 . the <unk> they took them back on the <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
she &apos;s barely breathing and was blue .
the <unk> blew all the strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> them on the <unk> .
i was shocked and to the inner <unk> .
and i was through this rollercoaster because she went to the <unk> of the <unk> , and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days realized that she never would again again .
she had not been suffering from a <unk> <unk> .
their family together .
and over the next eight or nine days , they &apos;d come to the <unk> .
the <unk> day you go to the <unk> of the day -- a woman , a woman and grandmother .
you say you &apos;re the names of those of the <unk> .
and this was the first time i learned this .
the next weeks i did , i was <unk> , and i learned the first time , the most famous shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of common shame that you feel because you don &apos;t have to talk to the colleagues about it .
they all know the common shame if you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s prize , although this one on the <unk> <unk> and then you get them and the best friend and i &apos;m going to have a terrible conversation , and you &apos;ll make a horrible conversation , if a <unk> , and you &apos;ll make a horrible conversation , if a <unk> , and you &apos;ll make a horrible conversation , if a <unk> , and you &apos;ll make a horrible conversation , if a <unk> , and you &apos;ll make a horrible conversation
if you do , and the mistake never does the mistakes .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the most famous way i talk about is that one in the <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s the one that tells you that what you do is bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on the bottom of my <unk> , he was very thankful .
he spoke with the family , and i &apos;m sure he was the <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;m sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked them to ask me questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why do i advise them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i do a kind of dumb mistakes ?
why am i going to medicine ?
but it &apos;s very much .
i began to feel better .
and then a day of a day , a day , was a hole in the clouds and the sun burst , and i said i could feel better again .
and i was considering that if i had my efforts to perfection perfection , and never again , a mistake that the voice could be <unk> .
and they did it .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
and i had a <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north of toronto and i was <unk> a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of go and i got in a hurry .
he was always here .
i looked at the <unk> and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and yet when he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> .
and i came to my next <unk> and my graduate school students asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out that he was a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> condition called <unk> .
you can &apos;t say that , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , but the top of the <unk> , and causes the <unk> of the <unk> .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> , and he recovered a few days .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt <unk> and went back to the work and again and again .
in a <unk> , i have a <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of them , especially if you think that you work in a hospital that has only 14 at 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no one in their treatment .
i thought he would have <unk> .
i <unk> the archimedes kidneys , and when it was a <unk> , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient &apos;s <unk> of the patient &apos;s own right , and called the <unk> .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> and asked my colleagues to watch him too well .
and he did , and he was a <unk> in the right , the one , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and it was all of them .
both of the time i &apos;m preparing to me , <unk> me .
and i would love to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which many of my colleagues claim , but it &apos;s a complete nonsense .
some of my favorite day of the most of my favorite years happened in the last five years .
alone , <unk> and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not going to finish with my mistake and talk about it , if i can talk to the quiet voice that tells me what doesn &apos;t really find , how can i share it with my coworkers ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t do the same ?
if i &apos;m in a room -- just like now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did you heard the last time by someone talking about <unk> about <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you may be hearing about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t talk somebody about your own mistakes .
if i had a full space with colleagues and around your comprehensive support , and we started to tell you what i just told you , i wouldn &apos;t be able to get the end of the second story before it would be really awkward , you would have to go to the subject and the rest .
and in fact , if i had my colleagues , i knew that a <unk> <unk> in my hospital was taken the wrong leg , then you believe in the eyes of it .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who are doing mistakes and the people who don &apos;t do , the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response such as antibodies that you &apos;re facing .
and there is the idea that if we are the ones that are the mistakes from medicine , that we have a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my own , about 20 years of medical school and journalism , i have a personal medical study over medical errors and <unk> treatments so that i was doing to learn from the <unk> star at my show , white <unk> , black art , &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in a single day where one of 10 <unk> is either a wrong or wrong , and always more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
in this state , 24,000 canadians are dying of <unk> errors .
in the united states , the united states , the number of 100,000 .
both are strong because we don &apos;t think of the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> in a <unk> , medical knowledge of all the three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of him .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient &apos;s to play pain .
then i &apos;m going to take the same patient with <unk> , and i &apos;ll put it <unk> and <unk> and give it a little breath and a very easily breath and suddenly the story of <unk> is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same trajectory .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things for things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of those are <unk> .
so if you take the system that way , how i got it , and all the <unk> <unk> , then , the end of the , no longer left .
and do you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and i would show you , &quot; white <unk> , black art , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; &quot; and then i &apos;ll show up with the microphone . &quot;
and then your pupils expand , they &apos;re in front of the head , they look down and they &apos;re going to be , and they &apos;re going to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what they need is an environment that you can get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to get able to
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the newly progressive doctor is a human being , know , the humanity , it &apos;s not very proud of doing it , but it &apos;s going to learn something from them to learn so that it can be passed .
it divides your experience with others .
they &apos;re encouraging by the other from their errors .
and it shows others whose mistakes don &apos;t have , not by <unk> , but in a <unk> , supportive way that all of this benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes people living the system with life and if that &apos;s like , people are also doing mistakes from time .
so that the system evolved to create the <unk> that we make easier errors that people make it inevitable and it allows it to create supportive , supportive , supportive , to create supportive , supportive , the potential of the world &apos;s health , even things that everybody who can make the potential mistakes and to make it the <unk> of the <unk> .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the redefine act .
i &apos;m a man . i do mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best possible to learn to the other other .
i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s holding from me , but i can live .
so let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in one minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories before the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was here .
you may think that he &apos;s <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he gathered fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a <unk> .
to the &apos; 80s , he was in great style of a .
now he &apos;s the species of the red list .
this is a story of many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come in the galapagos .
we still think , they are originally .
the <unk> is still describe them as pristine .
what &apos;s going on here ?
the second story is to be a different concept , the <unk> <unk> , possibilities .
because i &apos;ve been experienced it when i studied a lagoon in <unk> .
i went to this , because i grew up in europe and wanted to work on africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> and i felt convinced that i didn &apos;t actually have it from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon was from <unk> and from a few mangroves .
there were about 20 feet , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were doing good at the and making them good at ghana .
when i got up to go back to the , the fish was in half of its size .
trade standards , they &apos;re five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was lucky enough to be there .
so it has nothing , and yet everything changed .
my third little story , i &apos;m telling of my favorite <unk> of the <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more than the &apos; 60s -- <unk> europe .
<unk> was the countries that were already 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing was this very ugly ship called <unk> 4 .
i went on this , and we did this <unk> in the southern hemisphere of the ocean and particularly in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started out there .
now i know it was the bottom of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were in sponges , other animals that are linked to the bottom .
the most part of the fish , the little spots in the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially , the bottom of the sea was the deck of the sea , and then it &apos;s got <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
in a year , you &apos;re going to take a survey , and then the commercial fishing .
the reason is going to be , in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will be <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
and we began a living alive .
it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of primeval surgeries are now accumulated to be accumulated over the fishermen in the region where they &apos;re never going to be .
but it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our <unk> of the new level and we don &apos;t call it in what was there .
if you zoom out , it &apos;s what happens .
on the y-axis , there are a few good things : biodiversity , number of the <unk> , the green of their country , the <unk> .
it &apos;s how it changes . it changes , because for people , they are all of their actions .
every generation of the images that they &apos;re beginning to start in the beginning of their mind , as standard , and it will happen to it .
the difference is perceived as loss .
but they &apos;re taking the previous effect of losing the previous .
it can give a sequence of change .
and the end , they &apos;re just going to get the most of the .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
we want to get things that are gone , or things that aren &apos;t like they were .
you might think that the problem of people were in <unk> societies , and they were killing animals , and they were only conscious for a few generations , which they had done .
because obviously , an animal is , which is very often , it rarely before it was <unk> .
so you don &apos;t have a lot of animals .
you &apos;re always losing the slightest .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
we &apos;re looking at the big animals and the sea of the sea , the big fish .
they &apos;re rarer because we &apos;re catching them .
and with the time , little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people are embracing .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was a different way .
of course , many people , scientists , tell us that it was really different .
you &apos;ll tell it , because the evidence of how it forms in such a foreign form , not as you would have the evidence to be .
so , for example , the one of the report of a <unk> that was not used in this area that can &apos;t be used in this area , or not being able to be <unk> , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in vain societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the tremendously big role that can play a reserve .
because through <unk> , we &apos;re essentially the past .
we &apos;re going to come back to the past people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> have changed , and very low .
so , the people who are looking at a reserve of the <unk> , and the benefit of the benefit of the benefit of the <unk> .
what about the people who don &apos;t do it is because they don &apos;t have any access -- the people in the middle west ?
here , i think , the art and the film may be able to fill the gap and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remember to be in &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think of why people are being so touched by the <unk> of the <unk> , why were it so profound from the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that has lost in a way that we have lost in a way .
so my urging , the only thing i &apos;m going to give you , &quot; <unk> , so he &apos;s going to turn around the avatar .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the &apos; 80s , in the <unk> , you had to have to be a typewriter , and you had to be a typewriter .
they had to be a paper with <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason why , the government could pull to where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the <unk> of the thought of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how someone could do something like that , and how much of the freedom of freedom would be .
in our own countries , we would never do something .
but if you &apos;re in today , a new <unk> of the leading <unk> of the leading <unk> of the leading <unk> of the leading , and it &apos;s got this page , and this page is clearly <unk> on each side of them , in a pattern that shows the page on them and your printer .
this is what happens to us today .
and it seems to be nobody .
and this was an example of how our own governments are the technology against us , the citizens , are .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the <unk> of today .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , here , this is mr. <unk> <unk> in ukraine in ukraine .
and the subjects of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a large pile of money .
there are several familiar cases of <unk> , <unk> , who deserves their money by attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
a hundred watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve been illegal by doing it by having <unk> , to steal money from our <unk> , and also <unk> that our <unk> , the <unk> of the input , as we &apos;re buying our <unk> computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency <unk> two months ago the swiss bank account of mr. sam &apos;s <unk> here , and on this hive were <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is on the foot , the <unk> is not unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s more likely to be more likely to be a <unk> than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only worse .
in the future , most of the crime will play .
the second largest <unk> that we can see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , you know , a opinion , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are over over the last 12 months and are in the <unk> of the <unk> .
so those are the three <unk> : criminals , who are the money , how anonymous as anonymous , the <unk> , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are the case of the time of <unk> .
it shows a great thing that happens when governments are attacking their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or was it .
in the last fall , it had to be <unk> , because <unk> was been hacked .
somebody was been hacked , and had the system that was called the system .
and last week , i asked a meeting with a dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior of this group , whether it was possible for possible for possible for possible for possible for the <unk> people were died .
and his answer was , &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a row of a sudden ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they &apos;re selling .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , you need a <unk> website with <unk> , for example , <unk> .
now we all have , or many of us , you know , you &apos;re talking about , or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly prevalent in <unk> states like iran , because they know they can trust more than local citizens , because they know that they can trust more trust than local citizens , because they know that they can &apos;t trust more trust than local citizens , because they know that they can &apos;t trust them than local citizens , because they can &apos;t have any of the <unk> of the <unk>
can you , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of <unk> .
what does it like the arab spring and the things that happened for example in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the <unk> of the egyptian of the egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in this records was a &quot; <unk> &quot; .
and in this jar of the , they were notes in germany that the egyptian government sold a few programs that they could detect -- in very large scale -- can be able to capture any of the <unk> citizens .
they had this program for <unk> dollars to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so the west governments governments have governments with <unk> , so that can be against their own citizens .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks of the so-called <unk> , the so-called <unk> , which was a <unk> , which was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the phone .
but today we are far beyond .
they tap your internet connection .
they use the tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we go on thinking about these things , the obvious answer of people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t seem to me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument makes not make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , but every one that we &apos;re going to do , for always .
and trust , we trust us , we trust one future , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
so those are the questions that we have to have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first building blocks were created <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : <unk> <unk> , the fit .
<unk> were very rapidly the most <unk> <unk> in the world .
they gave us able to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , the <unk> of the time was the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came with this .
it was called &quot; automatically called stone stone .
and in less years , they moved into each other .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion of stones , or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful buildings , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego was fine for everybody .
lego , essentially the <unk> , the one building block of the world , and it &apos;s a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , the next year at the bell labs , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> that was <unk> from a world of <unk> , <unk> building blocks of the world , and it was interactive .
as the <unk> , the transistor allows us much more to build more complex and more complex , a stone after the other .
but there is a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t have that , that the one of the time of our time for expert , and therefore , i decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started studying this idea of how you could actually study the power of engineers and designers .
a few years ago , i began to develop in <unk> .
so let me show you how they work .
<unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> , which have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about this is that they connect with magnets together .
so they can &apos;t sit down together .
the stones are <unk> .
green is the final blue , blue is electricity , pink is wires , orange is cable .
so , all you have to do is a blue and a green and a green and they can build a lot of a bigger building .
they add a blue one , and you can make light .
you can put a wall between and they have a little bit of a <unk> .
take the switch out there , and this is , put it up , and they put a little bit of a <unk> .
add this <unk> for a little bit , and they have created a <unk> .
i &apos;ll stop that .
beyond the simple play , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of you have to program , <unk> or <unk> , allows you to program to use to intuitive gestures .
so , to slow down , or slow down , just turn it down on this button and it does it , and it does the momentum to slow down the momentum or the slow .
the idea behind the idea is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to put every single interaction on this world to a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> <unk> of children , and they &apos;re going to see them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that you &apos;re in the everyday in the everyday world , and they don &apos;t learn them in school .
like for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or how an ipod responds to the .
we also brought <unk> <unk> .
so we had , for example , designers with no experience in electronic electronic things , which started to play with <unk> as a material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and <unk> , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we took <unk> to risd , and gave them some designers who had no technological experience -- just card wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what is . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a hummer of play-doh , the fear of the darkness .
for this <unk> , it was a more material , electronics , just one more material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so , <unk> &apos;s open .
