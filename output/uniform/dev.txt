i &apos;m going to be close this photograph near me . it &apos;s in my office , because i have always felt a mythical connection to these two men , i have never seen ever .

and before you have kids , you won &apos;t understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people are going to find community in the world of egypt .
it needs time .
true guilt just raises a <unk> against one person , and somebody with syndrome syndrome is not a person . &quot;
to the people , it &apos;s not far .
but i found out to me that i &apos;m born the kids i &apos;m born , so love that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life .
he wouldn &apos;t get rid of his legs .
i come from a privileged family . i have a lot of luck .
it &apos;s about two weeks . and there are you .
this is the beginning . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here , many of you know , a lot of you know , dimitri -- went to cambodia , and i built through the <unk> of us , just when they connected to the internet .
think of it -- because there &apos;s other people as bill gates , who said , &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
latin latin , it &apos;s pretty rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .

in fact , it &apos;s just happening here -- from light to darkness in six seconds .
i look at your face very carefully .
that &apos;s not a expression of pleasure .
this lady here has actually been a particularly <unk> face , and both sides are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s <unk> light on it , so if you move around , so it gets a <unk> object , although it &apos;s still , just as brilliant as it is going through the reflection .
i had to move this part , but only a millimeter .
and what i &apos;ve been told you before , was of course , of course , a very complex .
it &apos;s going to win or lose it .
the emotional band between this object and they form them is a <unk> <unk> , which is happening before you think about it .
i don &apos;t think we need to meet that election .
it &apos;s also a thought we &apos;ve forgotten .
i think it &apos;s necessary for necessary to return to the tradition of the sermon .
we don &apos;t think that way .
and the end of the <unk> are all all of you and say , &quot; gee , jesus , thanks , jesus , jesus . &quot;
the other thing is that art is not saying that artists should not tell their <unk> , because if they <unk> them , the magic , and we would find it .

so this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll end up with this .
what people are first doing is the book that you can look for , and it &apos;s fun .
it was pretty much people .
but how do we all have a ?
we have the 10 cents a page if we work with big volume .

you end up about two or three <unk> per day .
with 15 dollars an hour , video and about 100 dollars an hour , we can put it on a <unk> of a hour , we can put it on the grid .
the question is : is the world that we want to live life ?

and this is how medicine sometimes .
we looked at the <unk> of the non-profit , we looked at the <unk> , and we found that they have technology and education , and then they have something that you have checklists .
and it spreads just hard .
so , these are really immensely much bees , and that &apos;s very important .
so that means that the world can &apos;t replace their dead people , and therefore , they could keep the ability to be low .
they take their hives and <unk> their families to the year to the year .
honeybees are in the <unk> , but in the course .
take a a cave in new york with a year of 15,000 bats , now , it &apos;s more than the one in the san francisco , in three years , the population of the population of the population of the earth .

for example , when his <unk> of his <unk> said , he said , &quot; and who are these young young men ? &quot;
and then , if you stayed standing , the boy were going up up up up to the top , 30 meters tall , and disappeared .

first , we &apos;ve developed a little experiment where we gave people legos and they asked them to build it .
and if they said yes , we gave them a new way , and as they <unk> this , we have the other thing they &apos;ve just built in the right place .
there was a very nice relationship between love with the love of the love of the <unk> legos .
and i think the ceo &apos;s basically not understood how important meaning .
but i should point out , by the way , that in the shredder condition , people would have been able to cheat .
people didn &apos;t want them .

until recently , we didn &apos;t really have to know how a vaccine did exactly .
the main challenge for those two viruses is that they &apos;re always changing .
these drugs are not a cure , but they &apos;re a huge victory of science , because it &apos;s the automatic death penalty of a <unk> , at least for those who have access to them .
but you know , the research that has been focused on hiv has helped us very much with the progress of other diseases .
this was a slow process , <unk> process , which was dependent on the <unk> , millions of living trash .
and beyond the radical production of production , and the vast size of the roots of the size of the , for example , i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the time -- you &apos;re going to live .
so the challenge is full force .
the question is : why ?
do you think the african union will undergo this conference ?
there are some things you have to know .
the speaker who was on the stage , <unk> muhammad , <unk> , <unk> , that we had <unk> leaders in africa .
by taking it from their <unk> people .
traditionally , the africans hate governments -- they hate it .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get help of the government , and he builds a second , <unk> boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for visualizing filter , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re the balance tipping , because they &apos;re going to go to the point of what you &apos;re first .
it &apos;s to take us to new ideas and new people and foreign perspectives .
and the man said , &quot; lovely <unk> , what ? &quot;
i know that you wait for another bad <unk> -- i do just fun -- but now i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of a hint , and then i &apos;ll show you new material about possible solutions .
to the <unk> of may , it &apos;s going to give an update on version of a car 2.0 where you can then get off to the purchase of <unk> .
and yet , all republicans here : it shouldn &apos;t go to the <unk> .
what i really impressed to the gulf of the gulf is that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and there is no one in fact , no one , except a few people trying to use the beach .
we have our <unk> that bacteria eat oil ?
this <unk> explosion goes across the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor was <unk> , they were at least back .
what the <unk> of the birds , i don &apos;t want to do a <unk> <unk> about people who can clean birds .
okay , people who are being conservative , if they really wanted to be really conservative and be really , you should send those <unk> to the <unk> .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical performance .
all right : &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes , &quot; -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to <unk> because it &apos;s true , but to remember you .
they contain a molecule that we know as a neurotransmitter .
and this is just a <unk> . it &apos;s much smaller than a human genome system .
now , nerve cells , as trees , can grow new branches and old .
and we can even talk about the <unk> .
if you look at this number , you can easily realize that there &apos;s a huge potential for the brain of your brain .
maybe this technology will be able to be able to know that we know ourselves from panels and we reassemble our own brains .
he &apos;s working on music videos and video videos with his company , the <unk> .
so we have a quick experiment here to show you that .
ks : no , not .
while he did , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so , as it works , there &apos;s a two-by-two of <unk> .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , i sent a a a friend of this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he still did this .
so his farm is incredible .
and then he found this <unk> plant , the <unk> .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try to try and get them before i went .
no salt , no steering , no oil , no oil .
what the hell does that mean ?
at least , i think it &apos;s .
farmers who rely on nature to find solutions to find answers , instead of nature solutions to the <unk> of nature .
and from the old fire to new fire , is to change two great stories about oil and electricity , both two fifth of the fossil <unk> into the air .
our fuel for mobility is to three fifth of cars .
you can make it quiet , it &apos;s tougher than titanium .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
and better light and <unk> and whatnot , the <unk> is reduced to a third .
in about 20 <unk> , they can &apos;t have a cheap cheap solar panels on their roofs and down their roofs , so their <unk> .
and what we &apos;re also replacing it , it &apos;s about the same costs : about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- although we &apos;re buying more of them , what we have , or a new nuclear power , or the renewables that are more or less .
so , in terms of results , and not incentives , can be <unk> and conflict to the <unk> of america &apos;s climate change .
i realized that , i realized that what i had eaten , two <unk> of his whole family .
this simple <unk> shows that donor in places where the least kids go to school not have schools . it &apos;s a new questions on the . it &apos;s a new way to deal with foreign aid , which you need most need to do most ?
two years ago , june eight , 2010 , i called my dad .
i don &apos;t try to design the toothbrush .
we remember and able to look at this in every book of my life &apos;s life that life was formed four billion years ago -- four billion two two two ?
that &apos;s how much i &apos;m not sure .
there are dangers , there &apos;s a trap , the vertical .
you have time to think , you have time to do , to talk about art and things like that .
you go back to the future , back back , back to the future , back .
they all come from families , in which is typically one person at home , mostly the mother &apos;s mother , and they come to your education and their structure .
we &apos;re bringing them to the right and left to the left so that you can tell , and the consequences you know , when they &apos;re orders .
let &apos;s go online all online . &quot;
it &apos;s what it &apos;s .
they said , &quot; well , that &apos;s enough for <unk> .
then you can support . this is the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen and join .
so let &apos;s take the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you think of the concept of wikipedia , at all the content , and the end , you &apos;ve created the largest encyclopedia in the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was created .
there was no leader .
extremism have become a catalyst .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what happens there , an incredibly complex process .
we can hold your own language apart from our own , but not the alien languages .
we &apos;ve been doing this by the way we &apos;ve heard of american babies who never heard a second language , at the beginning of the critical stage of the time .
it may look like a <unk> of mars .
science on the one hand has a very rational attitude to their environment , while art on the other side is usually an emotional attitude to its environment .
now i have a <unk> here to show you that .
so let me show you here .
the dalai lama said said , &quot; love and compassion are <unk> .
the rags were <unk> by a little girl whose body was burned down .
she &apos;s part of all human <unk> .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose to be compassion ?
the wound was alive .
suppose you like squares , and honestly , who doesn &apos;t like it ?
we start with a <unk> and then we &apos;ll imagine another <unk> .
then there was <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
i said , &quot; he &apos;s been dead .
&quot; have i <unk> ! ? &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get memo . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby , and i saw these indian guys .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said , &quot; magic is the only <unk> profession .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;ll show you how closely terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
at the time i interviewed the red brigades , i discovered that whose life was not dominated by ideology and politics , but by economic constraints .
i think a lot of people thought me for a little bit of a little bit .
but most of all , they got to do in serious accuracy with crime .
this money was going to <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- in bar , you know .
nobody wants to control the <unk> of his body , and his <unk> with customer .
some of you may think , &quot; wait . &quot; wait . &quot; wait . it doesn &apos;t necessarily look like a <unk> .
yeah , i wanted to leave my <unk> , but what i didn &apos;t see , but what i didn &apos;t see was that it &apos;s extremely uncomfortable to leave his <unk> .
and i really learned that the bigger the challenge , the greater the feeling of a particular achievement when you get to the end .
now , i thought the atlantic was large , but the pacific is really very large .
but this didn &apos;t go .
it &apos;s this little green layer on the horizon , which is very much about the rising sea level .
we can begin to meet better , more affordable , affordable decisions .
<unk> <unk> : why i &apos;m going to <unk> across the pacific
this is the world trade on the page .
why ? why ? why do you want to do this ?
it doesn &apos;t look at the cost . it doesn &apos;t use extra time .
they were able to make this .
and finally , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about that they &apos;re comfortable in places that they didn &apos;t have comfortable in .
and that &apos;s hard if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i said , how can it be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard , and i was a day before school , i said , &quot; yeah , you can do my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers that i had written at the night before .
we both have been in the back benches in the classroom , so we didn &apos;t pollute with <unk> .
maybe you have your <unk> and <unk> teeth , but never told it , because how can you tell you if everybody &apos;s going to bury you underneath it ?
that &apos;s french science .
all right , then .
if you look at this trucks here , it &apos;s the largest trucks of his way on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest-growing co2 of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s why canada now is the number three , in terms of a <unk> per head .
and as a dad , i can &apos;t imagine what a soul is doing .
by doing this , we we &apos;re going to be able to put a large part of our largest <unk> , and it &apos;s the most greenhouse of the future of the future .
the <unk> of their work is the <unk> that you can buy in every store and millions of indian women on their forehead , and it &apos;s a a ritual that &apos;s intimately linked to the institution of marriage .
<unk> shaw , in <unk> , was born in <unk> , and in london , in london .
i hope you can convince you that complex and complicated are not always the same .
the most famous <unk> is the one that we want to influence -- the public support for government .
so i suggested in my first tedtalk that we should spend a planet for $ a week , and i &apos;m talking about video games .
only <unk> <unk> per day , for a <unk> improvement in the mood and <unk> of the joy of the joy .
why do a game ?
how could a <unk> game could be such a huge effect in such <unk> , sometimes <unk> conditions ?
there are four kinds of strength , or resilience , and there &apos;s scientific <unk> things that can do every day to make this resilience , you don &apos;t need to have a trauma .
through more practice , it &apos;s going to be .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you &apos;re going to watch your hand six seconds , the <unk> of your blood will be strong , the <unk> .
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world and we &apos;re doing it with us , actually , thousands of people involved in this project , many of different things .
and then a few people came from chicago and said , &quot; end , the theme of chicago &apos;s <unk> festival is the global warming , we have a 3,000-square-foot square gallery and we want you to put them with their reefs . &quot;
wool and <unk> are not two concepts , which are good .
<unk> said , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . they &apos;re <unk> .
so we have , from wool , by the domestic force , the proof that the most famous <unk> of mathematics is wrong .
and their individual ideas , and their work with this mathematical method .
this particular <unk> trait -- the self-confidence -- is my opinion , the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll understand what &apos;s going on inside of what &apos;s going on inside .
this person is otherwise in <unk> understood and intelligent sense , but if he sees his mother , he has his fake his hand , he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this domain , if this domain is damaged , you lose the ability to detect face .
tables and chairs and <unk> -- nothing happened , as usual people , but if i show him a picture of his mother , the only <unk> activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . it &apos;s a soft , <unk> experience .
maybe you can solve the <unk> , the spasm of the phantom .
and my pain are gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t know phantom phantom , and therefore no more <unk> in the elbow , no , , no <unk> in the <unk> . all my pain are gone .
<unk> is blue , <unk> is green , a different sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is buba ?
your favorite is to <unk> , which most of us are not going to be .
that &apos;s kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video is <unk> .
good .
he learned that he &apos;s both hands , when he <unk> them with their <unk> <unk> , much more and more <unk> .
a frame meaning a hut in the woods .
does he look where the sound is coming ?
because we believe that it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular supernova explosions , which remains like this remains .
on the right-hand side , gravity has been . einstein has explained this .
and beyond that , it &apos;s a new way of change .
it was very early , but he was a moral system , a inspiration for scientists who were concerned about the control of the guns .
suppose we have seen ourselves , we had our most disastrous species from far outside the outside of the the other , but it &apos;s the four billion years of the earth &apos;s earth .
martin author asks : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s worse , &quot; then i would do a photograph of this and a dozen year-old .
now , these are students , so they gave them a lot of money for things like <unk> and make-up .
and then we asked them , how do they are .
but enormous different incentives .
this is <unk> in belgium .
the teams , which we gave money to spend on each other , then they were to the other teams and the end in the end .
if we heard about hearing from the <unk> , from the high levels of the , we often believe that this is one of this most profound conflict of the middle east , whose roots are as as age of itself .
ironic , as the <unk> of iran was in the world peace , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that &apos;s focused on terms of diplomacy , is the diplomacy is inevitable , is war .
you can look at the specific levels or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port <unk> at the end of 2009 didn &apos;t be as good as it , not as well as the map of california .
the trick is doing .
and the explanation said , &quot; he wasn &apos;t environmentalists . &quot;
this system wants to be the status quo , the status quo , the status quo .
so it &apos;s not that my theme is the most important . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , the republic of the republic .
for example , some people in this room thanks to a fellowship for a fellowship .
it &apos;s on my pen . &quot;
everybody &apos;s just a little bit of a little bit .
i don &apos;t want to say that law is not true , it &apos;s true .
here in the model , you see the attacking the <unk> .
if you see fireflies in north america , they are like so many things in the united states , they &apos;re going to ignore each other .
so , each of your favorite <unk> depends on this critical region , the <unk> that over the 10,000 independent cells , each <unk> , an electronic rhythm -- a high , a high , a high -- to pump the <unk> signal to pump the <unk> .
they were a while , but then they were going to be apart .
so i &apos;d like to show you a few interviews with people who are the opening up on the bridge , and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t think , don &apos;t think of a metronome , but we &apos;re all walking -- we &apos;re going to walk back and walk back .
on the one thing , this weighs just a few tons , so they &apos;re going to go pretty quickly .
but the <unk> scientists in his domain .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but it was in <unk> sequence , and i told them , you should look for your name , your <unk> , or the <unk> of your mother .
also , perhaps this <unk> , or maybe a <unk> that &apos;s not worth the <unk> , a <unk> , a way to disease or pests or a different property that is useful for climate change , and the others don &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see kids on television .
the idea with svalbard was that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under the <unk> .
and if anything happens , you can come up and pick it up .
thank you .
watch your position ! this is not right here .
maybe there &apos;s a lady , a lady ? thank you very much .
you &apos;ve tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one of the russians .
excellent ! i have to talk about innovation -- the stuff that we &apos;re developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then you &apos;re going to die through something else .
i can &apos;t tell you when it &apos;s going on , because i don &apos;t want the competition to my schedule .
i mean , i mean , interesting , this is going to happen here .
ok , we &apos;re going to talk a little bit about the commercial development of the <unk> space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has an epiphany .
institutions are &quot; and if you &apos;re naked , well , the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle is <unk> .
the toothpaste is from the <unk> .
they know that bees and fish in their lives .
all around us , there &apos;s a medical revolution , a revolution that will help us to be some of the most salient diseases of our society , cancer with .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a <unk> crowd , <unk> in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the blood supply , after treatment .
but the real question is : how do it work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a <unk> , it prevents angiogenesis in a very effective way .
but even more interesting , the study is that the men who evolved to have the <unk> , so that the more tomato sauce , actually had fewer blood vessels that lives their cancer .
albert of <unk> once said that &quot; discoveries consists of seeing what everybody has seen , and think what nobody thought nobody thought . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> in discover magazine .
it has to be fun , unlike any common issues , frankly , not frankly , are not really good puzzles .
one of the the the background .
you cannot do that , but on a computer , it goes .
i wanted to make a sequel .
so , what the direction of that , are the ones ?
so , there are games like &quot; the &quot; brain &quot; for the nintendo , a <unk> .
looks like a black figure . where is this ?
i really think that a girl , so powerful is that we all didn &apos;t have to train to be that way .
i remember , as example , my dad , who was very , very violent , i was stunned .
we &apos;re used to being able to be able to become to be able to become to be able to become to be <unk> , to be their own life , and they actually have to have them in their own .
and she looked into the eyes of her babies and said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , it was a ritual where they &apos;re girls who are <unk> , the <unk> , with their families .
and i &apos;ll be the rest of your life on your side . &quot;
i love it , i &apos;m not going to take the things off .
why should you want to be <unk> , <unk> ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers would say , and <unk> the <unk> , they had done this in the photo array .
but the incident came in the middle of january , in the northern hemisphere , at seven o &apos;clock at the end .
that &apos;s 10 meters away .
and what does this case -- what is important to us in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a <unk> , and i went through africa , where i asked people why they built fractals , what a great job is when you can get it .
and that puts in some of the villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would spend a long time of life because it &apos;s very fast , and they &apos;re very cheap .
just and odd gives odd .
we have a <unk> in ghana .
the bad news .
instead of being friends or dream , they look at a <unk> of <unk> .
today , <unk> development is deployed in a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to the <unk> .
the fear of <unk> are going to do .
we &apos;re looking at a few rules and keep in front of them .
the conversation will go . &quot;
just when i was <unk> tonight , i began to come here , one of my daughters .
and we developed 10 .
i was a teenager when i first met &quot; anna <unk> &quot; and the famous first first grade , &quot; all happy families .
i want to show you how something like this is so beautiful to look at .
if i &apos;m here , you see a <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> is the <unk> , the water from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> . it &apos;s the dry .
and plato , with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : <unk> ...
i &apos;ll show you .
but tesla success was not been from any time .
one thing i want to be is the moment is that not all the neurosurgeon .
we can turn them down and turn it down , or turn on .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it in the circuits in the <unk> of depression .
we &apos;re to grasp what those circuits are , and what the brain for the clinical symptoms are responsible for the clinical symptoms and symptoms of those diseases .
evolution is actually more than an engineer as an engineer .
that &apos;s enough .
what we &apos;ve discovered is , if you look at the leg of a human being , like richard , or a <unk> or a <unk> or a shrimp , relative to the relative <unk> of this feather , the same thing we &apos;ve seen before .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s amazing , students , they couldn &apos;t say .
he does this with a <unk> glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a role model , and imagine it with another fellow colleagues at berkeley .
showed that from the <unk> of the <unk> leader , two thirds of the most famous men , but only a third of the women &apos;s most women .
on monday , i left san francisco , my <unk> , and flew at this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at us and say , &quot; what is it on you ? &quot;
there is a famous study at harvard business school over a woman called heidi <unk> .
and i got my hand back and i fell back to all the other women , and then you have more questions , just by men . &quot;
a woman contacted me this , and i looked at it -- she looked at a little bit young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as usual as they should , but they do it .
so not fear was the <unk> .
but it &apos;s the middle of the black ones .
now , i want to talk about this , about how we &apos;re going to go to this country , how we get to information .
so , you &apos;re in <unk> , more , more , more , more , more , more , more clear .
we tell them that everything is fine . that it &apos;s okay .
this patient is about 50 , so we can actually tell pretty much how large is the risk of prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need the educational level of the listener in this room .
and this bumblebee had accepted , &quot; i &apos;m now that <unk> , the flower , i get the nectar and i &apos;m going to get off . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , as an artist &apos;s my favorite subject , how is the idea of the <unk> ?
all right , we &apos;re all equally <unk> .
the only technology here is the cheap <unk> : quite new , to a <unk> , , even i could <unk> a <unk> of 10 to 10 .
if a <unk> <unk> , the grass is the grass , and it &apos;s going to happen to be something interesting .
and now i &apos;m saying that i want to build a game on top of the world , but that &apos;s not true , because it &apos;s already in the development ; it &apos;s going to happen .
if it doesn &apos;t , it &apos;s a shame . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come on a certain time , you get your drinks to half the price .
and then you can actually get a good way of doing it .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a community of a community that tries to find the best news , the most exciting stories .
we &apos;ve talked about the last week of a few years ago .
you can also see that , i &apos;m not going to throw this around here -- hopefully i don &apos;t touch the world too .
you can see , here it started .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> , who actually should teach students to teach , and the law of the <unk> , just as a hobby , as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it &apos;s what it does to work in a place where it &apos;s fun to work .
and that &apos;s why we work , and we &apos;ve even got people excited about it and crazy enough to work on it , that &apos;s really your goal .
thank you .
what what &apos;s exciting about how he said , for his passengers was the experience of the experience .
what does life do , more enjoyable ?
so , part of the , they &apos;re doing this by using a great new facility , the basement of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of the time is <unk> <unk> and the part of the present problem .
and as exciting , we can see ourselves in systems , a bigger impact .
from my astonishment , he &apos;s a <unk> , the waiter , the waiter .
mark <unk> and i have been trying to do this question .
yet it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm demanded .
but for the <unk> , the <unk> availability of all those <unk> on the marketplace was like a <unk> .
the americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice in the theory seem to be more attractive than in practice .
<unk> parents would be more like , &quot; noah was just for the same time , but he has been taught us so much .
robert frost said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that has lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very fancy <unk> of pink . &quot;
the three issues have one in common : they &apos;re <unk> problems that are controlled by natural forces .
so ... thank you .
it &apos;s going to replace competition by working .
and then we build a <unk> , which we can actually test the power of the machines , and we can be very , very fast .
girl : no .
and so i realized that the <unk> of the best didn &apos;t understand as a <unk> , but as a <unk> movement .
the nuclear weapon enters the stage .
and then the 92 of nuclear power that would provide the energy , the rest of los angeles .
then you can take it and put it on the screen of your television , and it &apos;s the outside of the outside , so that &apos;s what it is .
if you replace the word monopoly or the west &apos;s internet , it &apos;s very well that your idea now is very <unk> . listen , we &apos;re going to be in .
i think it was this exchange that led to the .
ph : i hope you understand how <unk> is this .
finally , the race to win momentum is won the future , as the company company .
mm : because it has a role in the audience , something to do .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars per minute .
and where television is what the <unk> is built , is a very exciting new kind of communication , and we have the <unk> of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is an spanish architect and designer .
color can be simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think .
it has given me to me -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we &apos;re all talking about and build a few installations .
the use of the city for public space , is great , almost a international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls . &quot;
and that was what i was like , after some of the <unk> and <unk> , at the design of the stage , i ended up with you .
he said , she said , you have a new , better chairs .
or they &apos;re going to be the position position .
i knew , but i knew from experience , and if i went to the offices where there were <unk> <unk> , that there was no one to the idea of the , <unk> , to turn a <unk> and the the church to turn them in position .
and dengue has turned into <unk> .
so two days ago , i can &apos;t remember that , i can &apos;t remember exactly , i &apos;ve read a <unk> that <unk> the first <unk> <unk> , about 52 cases , <unk> , with 400 <unk> cases .
we need something that was really <unk> , so that it didn &apos;t spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : men are females , all of the offspring .
so , <unk> are not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time i &apos;m barely taking away from that i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
look at the data data .
well , our mobile phone can now become a history of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : your health depends on where they live .
that &apos;s my grandfather .
the reason that nobody else is talking about it .
as the beginning of the beginning , you &apos;re going to grow phosphorus from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from an <unk> of &quot; nature , which the debate about the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of the time they &apos;ve lost .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we &apos;re going to take one percent of 25 percent .
we have a working technology and one that uses some of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
and he was a so-called <unk> , and he looked at all the <unk> and the <unk> to find rules and laws , rather than to look at the norms .
and in this case , you see that the one steps are over , but they &apos;re going to be able to be without being <unk> .
as an architect , i &apos;m just about the parts and all the , but in terms of behavioral thinking , it &apos;s always going to be a business for companies .
we &apos;re at the level of the <unk> of the building of the building , where we could build five hundred towers towers , but they should all be able to put on the 60 <unk> of the mass to a single mass .
and again , we come back , a few years later , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is actually in fact as a after the redwood .
the difference is particularly in <unk> in the desert , or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever they want .
here &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were illegal , and now on the air .
we have the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by no implants , the huge problems of water quality costs , rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important <unk> for <unk> .
but we can do this and there &apos;s opportunities .
irrigation is the largest <unk> of the <unk> .
work to work .
so , what is this kind of system d ?
we want to see our products in the store .
the whole system system doesn &apos;t pay to control .
we &apos;re interacting with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we &apos;re using biological <unk> to reinforce these <unk> structures .
this is what it looks like .
here we &apos;re , or cut the nerve , or cut the nerve , and the other parts of the <unk> and the other pristine pristine , we gave us our own -- signal , two , the <unk> of us , the our hand -- signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode in the <unk> and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal , something clinically clinically to the .
this is jesse and he presses a <unk> .
so thank you .
sub-saharan africa is tremendous than the most prolific , because there are 22 million people living with hiv , which is estimated that are estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are the world .
governments have to create effective accessible to ethical solutions in clinical trials , which are available in the various developing world , <unk> in the various developing countries , which are the government and the <unk> of the trial .
the fundamental issues that we face are , is to be a too high consumption and too many people .
so they &apos;re all criteria that people don &apos;t like .
so you can see this power that goes to north -- the <unk> in this case -- the way to the galapagos , and this <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
we also know that not only <unk> are threatened , but equally penguins and others .
now , i want to show you that penguins are going to be pulled into <unk> .
turbo has <unk> <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ll put it in and he &apos;s in in there .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes very comfortable with .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t have solved : our fundamental political political geography .
so the two pieces are going to be a very long border .
again , as in the case of mongolia , china has not conquered russia . it &apos;s <unk> .
for <unk> countries , china is its <unk> , so that <unk> and cambodia were cheaper to to china and from <unk> to china .
so what i want to introduce you here , i &apos;ll call it a day day .
these two arrows form a bow , a <unk> of <unk> and other infrastructure that the west bank is connecting to gaza .
most of them .
so what is next ? what is the future of european union ?
53 countries , and most of the sudden , the most of the most of the <unk> lines on the map .
this dream exists .
it &apos;s bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone serum is accelerating growth .
so how can a hormone is then the speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 are hormones , which are active in the most of the conditions of conditions -- in good times -- if food is in the , and not much of stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the detail about how it works , but we know that foxo genes are an impact on the lifespan of human beings .
in principle , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of what i &apos;ve been talking about , which is a very rapid <unk> , like a bird , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
they &apos;ll never see an ad that you can see , because nike wants to buy your shoes .
they all show the heroes , the <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to walk on a <unk> .
this is why that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> how prozac are basically the chemistry of the brain , as if indeed , the brain of the container was the <unk> of a chemical soup .
and my <unk> fellow , <unk> <unk> thinks that .
and by the <unk> , we found that a <unk> , much longer needed to get back to the <unk> , and when we were the genes that in this mutation , we could detect a <unk> .
and that question has been asked for a long time , but in flies , we can actually test it .
so , mosquitoes find us in the dark , by changing us , and they smell us .
just to see it , this is the cheese .
people actually have told me that they &apos;re being bitten by mosquitos .
in <unk> .
and every time i felt the <unk> looks of the eyes of the eyes behind me .
and as <unk> , is fat one of the best sources for adults .
as we speak , we &apos;re going to go to about clinical clinical trials to study the use of the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have the angels in the world , not just in our country : venezuela , in our world .
so what happens when what does not happen ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
and i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i stopped hearing on the headline .
<unk> <unk> : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make these receivers , help of material that is coded in the dna .
the animal jumps , it has its wings out , it &apos;s <unk> , but it can &apos;t really start off , because the fly between two <unk> is .
for a smart nature like our fly , is not a rule of stone , but it changes the animal that &apos;s learning through experience .
through many of those experiments , we were able to get the identity of the critic &apos;s identity of the the the the <unk> of the the the the the the <unk> of the the the the <unk> of the the <unk> .
there are a few ideas in the <unk> and the synthetic intelligence of how you could do that , but we still haven &apos;t solved one of the way intelligent behavior of the physical matter of living matter .
here &apos;s what libby , or actually , a <unk> of libby .
ed : yeah . stop . it &apos;s a little bit after the middle of a little bit more to the middle .
in my own experience , i know that the clinics can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
and one of the things i tell you , this kind of <unk> , which is all the way of your goals to your goals , the <unk> transformation that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime in health care .
they &apos;re not stick on the way or glue , or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if they climb down to the bottom of the <unk> , and it would be a <unk> , or we would shake the leaf ? &quot;
and so , <unk> , and he does this .
of course , in a <unk> , you would see that in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea levels .
and i would say , people are working in the oceans and think about the goals , we think we &apos;re much lower .
this is the ship that i was the last three months of antarctica .
when this ice melts up rising sea level .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news is the <unk> of the galapagos .
you &apos;re the relationship with the water .
but then at the end , you see the <unk> in black .
we have very interesting ways of co2 co2 in the atmosphere of the <unk> of the world , but in this case , we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked , &quot; how gravity works .
einstein had already been space and time and <unk> and curves in the gravity .
but deep in the structure of the room , the idea , could give more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a violin , you can vibrate the same thing as well as you can vibrate .
not .
is this just an interesting mathematical constructed , which perhaps is able to explain some of <unk> <unk> <unk> properties of the world , or can we actually detect these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates on top of them .
now , can you see the predator that is what is the is to attack ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information , it &apos;s true for all of the information .
and we &apos;re looking at about 30 seconds of what a pretty hammer is in a 18 minutes .
why ? because if the <unk> in this shadow would be in the shadow , and the same amount of light on your eye would have to reflect like the <unk> outside of the shadow , you would have to reflect more easily .
how do you know ?
and she comes in the hive , finds a void <unk> and your hands -- and that &apos;s honey .
he &apos;s going to find him . excellent , right ?
do you agree ? yes ?
often there &apos;s no right or wrong there or wrong .
in 2010 , in the new york not that way .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
now , some of the things : understanding of certainty , the risks that are the <unk> , the <unk> , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need to understand the many risks that we face are facing .
think of cancer , avian flu , swine flu , sars .
there were no new insights , but less afraid .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i &apos;m like to call it <unk> by trying to protect our <unk> and data to our <unk> .
i know , i know , a group of the other group , to detect if my airplane was certainly to fly .
this is the people people .
and he was found here nearby , at stanford .
they had good deal with their teachers , students .
so let me ask you some questions about finding out if that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took some of them to get to get to get to get to get to get to me , or to save me as a volunteer , but i found out that nobody did .
we opened the first stage in 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky
and groups have been called the &quot; terrorists . &quot;
they need a <unk> process that &apos;s the core of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about that we probably have a revolution in the history of the arab world of the ground : a <unk> .
paradox is that the <unk> decade was so <unk> .
at once , the ngos , their slogans are not just on the streets -- they took them in negotiations , partly because they were victims of the weapon of those weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think , &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was a completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange man in the film ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day comes out the sun comes out , the <unk> coming , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to give you a little bit , i &apos;m a little bit of a little bit , because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we should think differently about cancer , a a lot of people who are a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics by just seeing the genetic appearance .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; okay . at least this guy &apos;s good connected . &quot;
so we &apos;re essentially measuring every <unk> than one of the own .
if you have malaria , we give them <unk> , or some of the <unk> of them .
where we really have to get , the process that just is happening right now , and at the level of the most dramatic activity on the stage of the time of the , how it does not dissolve it ? &quot;
danny hillis : cancer , understand how through proteomics
they all are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give up those people .
because at stage three , most of us are .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before anybody did this .
in fact , martin luther king &apos;s king sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair and i &apos;m not doing anything . &quot;
and suddenly they got the <unk> out and trying to figure out , &quot; how do we see the population of africa ? &quot;
automatically , we &apos;re the little bits up up the top .
these <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who were designed to be so much to the ground , to <unk> the power of the ground , they were not as permanent buildings .
they <unk> the stability and safety that can offer the lap of an uncle , comparing it to the <unk> of a <unk> niece in high school .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most powerful form of <unk> gratification .
i can &apos;t really explain them , and he doesn &apos;t .
stories like these , symbols like these , are practical aid in a world that is looking for , to bring to the <unk> of the suffering from suffering from the <unk> of the suffering that might not have us to be <unk> .
gandhi was also a really <unk> man .
and the first day , our <unk> <unk> and taught us our own , we had to use every day for the rest of the summer to produce the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of their famous ones .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we cannot be part of a group , without understanding the other minds of the other .
so this is the world that we live today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my
okay , number two : go into the wilderness .
and imagine that , imagine an inner picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , sadly , very <unk> , and my parents didn &apos;t have higher school .
and so we believe that through all those changes that are happening , that we are amazing opportunities today .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
we now send 30 different technologists to 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people , trying to learn how to do this particular segment and demands .
and on my graduate school , my dad came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember , i remember that every generation has to do better than the previous one .
i know a lot of people who are very smart and yet , &quot; why can i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started with a different family , in 1980 .
don &apos;t believe that we have the responsibility to take the conservation seriously ? &quot;
i drive the same four ford as well as before .
but this is not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s .
whether you believe or not , doesn &apos;t make any difference for me .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what is this in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this piece of a desktop , your identity , what they are .
when my kids were little bit , i was still , i sat in her room , sat down on her bed and i looked at my kids sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i have three to 10 to 10 to 10 -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
and in a village , we have a hundred laptops , each with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly 10,000 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for <unk> .
and you answer the question : how does it feel like , realizing that you &apos;re going to be ?
we &apos;re really going to learn this really bad lesson .
think of it for a moment , how it is , is to feel in right .
and unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with it , trying to figure out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly <unk> book about a subject that everybody hate , to an audience that never would give .
and of course , it &apos;s not just <unk> <unk> wheat , but mountains of grain .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
the answer was <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s worse . &quot;
our <unk> crops went on a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom , our <unk> has <unk> our <unk> .
and bhutan , for those who don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re often stopped happiness in the west , as if the happiness was to capture , a thing , or maybe , several things we need to get .
and we ask you to ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as a leaders is that we can change the production of production by doing the right conditions , so that our employees can live their calling .
bl : all right . one , two , three .
underneath the deck , you tell you the <unk> , you move your way . but the eyes are moving along the boat and say , &quot; i &apos;m quiet . &quot;
amy : do you ask ?
the way did you do ? what did you see ? what did you see ?
i just read one of .
real scientific education should be a voice and you to empower them , and that &apos;s why amy the last word in this short history .
poor people have this option of choice .
we were <unk> into the &apos; 70s .
and to come along there , we have to realize that the principle of a <unk> is not only the species we &apos;ve talked about , but our society is <unk> .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody you &apos;ve been wondering , &quot; yes , great stuff up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at the <unk> davis and i got a lot of attention to it , and that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they drop apart , they &apos;re <unk> , and they end up here .
i mean , people are wondering , whether cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> mobile phone .
and for those who can &apos;t read , &quot; it seems like this : &quot; it seems like this , it seems to be a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
and green , and natural <unk> , where not <unk> , are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> of the <unk> of our bodies .
first , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> death of the <unk> .
i found that months later , i knew who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold him alive , if you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper in our hands , we &apos;ve shifted the hope again .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows he &apos;s been beaten .
so to give you this , we have to put it back to the driver &apos;s seat .
we <unk> the area , we <unk> it , we sent people , we put it in the building , we put the building in the first <unk> , and the quest to save .
if i do this , i &apos;m not going to do the original detail . the other , i could write a story here .
you will be withheld from the public opinion .
it &apos;s not particularly good .
and that &apos;s a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : which is the rise of <unk> , china , or india ?
because the indian man has been in for two years from two years to the indian woman .
what political change is , they &apos;re introduced to <unk> .
so , china , i think , has a lot of very exciting , <unk> -- particularly in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality , a sense of equality , a sense of equality .
it was a place where people with <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
and now , you have the problem that they &apos;ve spent the whole money to afford this advanced electronics in those countries , and now is all the <unk> .
a slightly devastating environment , where many ideas came together , where people are more , interesting , interesting , <unk> , people have had different origin .
about one or two decades ago , a wonderful <unk> program , and i read that darwin &apos;s <unk> from this period .
they <unk> with their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it .
does that go the other way ?
in the 1970s , one percent &quot; 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
so many of these political factors can be summarized roughly summarized in the category of capitalism , and political changes that are very comfortable with a group of good associated with , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
and as you can just watch , as a matter of how globalization and technological revolution are creating this global lifestyle of money , it &apos;s much harder to contribute to the whole .
therefore , they &apos;re unprecedented amount of time and resources to train their children .
we created the modern <unk> .
this is your little hand .
we &apos;re all going to die of this .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we had a new development of this .
i even think that in places like oregon , where you can take care of <unk> and a toxic dose , only half half a percent of people have ever done .
so , long , long , long , a long talk , you came to canada .
but i heard about cancer as most of the most primitive condition of our time , how adapted the good and the bad thing ?
some of the papers went to even as far as to say that <unk> is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only but not only for cancer , but it &apos;s not just to the other that metastases in skeletal muscle .
16 percent . meaning that this <unk> tumor in skeletal muscle was , but only 16 percent of the real metastases -- what <unk> that skeletal muscle may might be able to control those blood vessels for themselves .
this is a very much <unk> idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and then i left my translator .
she was the girl , in the breaks the other for her team .
and the same thing i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had 11 old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot;
so the two came to lunch for lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had kids from all of their own , and he found family for them .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open the window , look out , and see how co2 from the side of the sea &apos;s the ridge , the hotel are burning .
so we ran into the bath , they took off , and they stopped in front of our faces and the kids .
until the adoption is , a year ! what does it take for that long ?
this is their <unk> .
this is sydney , which is three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there &apos;s bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
but there are a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and this deeper <unk> , the principle is that the science is the way we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , all of the stars , all of here .
thank you very much .
see , in the middle of the country and zimbabwe <unk> , russia dropped one percent .
they find the highest hiv in the world in the african countries , and yet they find in senegal , the same rate as the united states .
look at the kenya here .
it might be that it &apos;s something else that is more likely to be more .
we know that about <unk> billion people have ever lived .
this was not just an economic history .
and the result is even more than a more than than in germany , in germany , in germany .
it &apos;s the same way it &apos;s with .
they have to give me just to eat . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions about the future billion , in order , if the united states is in the world , in the world , in china .
no , we &apos;re going to be able to get , regardless of the vast <unk> that we have to have , regardless of the indication that we &apos;ve lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical history .
niall , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider silk .
spider spider is almost entirely from protein .
the fibers that make a single spider , you &apos;re pretty diverse .
and also , <unk> has a potential to be a potential to the <unk> .
what i want to do is not the <unk> , so lovely as it may be , but the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
now , this sounds alien in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of the <unk> <unk> has a lot of people .
the first thing happens when you &apos;re a problem , that the first goal of the institution is to the end of the end .
the inventor , the inventor , not know what the invention is .
there are people in the states that are trying to figure out whether the bloggers are not , or not .
it was created by the <unk> of the many of these tools , and it &apos;s certainly afford the intelligence agencies today &apos;s intelligence in the world for the last week .
you have <unk> , which is probably the most part of the bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because <unk> is fibers .
everything is in its place . first stage .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , and you look at the different of the potential of the potential to a deeper level -- my quest to turn around the answer to the question , &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
so this is transformation , two different things .
and if they &apos;re shaped , they go back to the extent that they &apos;re alive and character .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of spent of a <unk> of a little bit of a beer .
it &apos;s going to be a kind of <unk> , as we work through this talk .
it &apos;s very , very long , to write those scores , and at the time i &apos;m working on a piece of the , the <unk> side , and that &apos;s a big part of my life , and i &apos;m the hair .
it &apos;s demonstrated by brian <unk> , who is an extraordinary artist .
so , you have a little bit of the <unk> of the piece .
what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two <unk> with dinner : a bowl with <unk> broccoli , and a bowl with <unk> <unk> .
i mean , last , , if we look at babies , the <unk> of us , they seem quite useless .
and our babies and children are much longer than the babies are in any other species .
the <unk> is the <unk> to change the hypothesis .
now , there are two things that are really interesting about this .
boy : that .
our consciousness is going to be extremely bright and vividly , and everything else will be like dark .
&quot; babies and little kids are like the research and <unk> of the human species , &quot; the <unk> curtain <unk> , the <unk> curtain , and their research studies how babies can make and make a zillion information and making decisions .
if i just could borrow a little demonstration for a little demonstration , to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
then you repeated this process over and over again to something more quickly -- in this case , the figure is to walk like i walk .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that .
here are a few simple scenes of how he got to .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did it .
some of the studio already use our software to do that , and we &apos;re going to get a few of our <unk> to see a few of our <unk> in a few major <unk> .
we thought that he would just hold the balance .
here you &apos;re learning to go to the <unk> , as most of you possibly know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m convinced that art and creativity are essential to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re the more lonely , you write a new york times , and then you get hundreds of email , most of what i &apos;m today to today is that i &apos;m talking today about frustration .
some stories are just classic , and yet , even classic .
it &apos;s <unk> . nobody ever bought it .
there &apos;s a limit that we don &apos;t want to cross . so what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want a new way of making a piece of the word -- that could happen !
but i think there are actually two <unk> .
the other products were being supported by microsoft by microsoft &apos;s standard instead of apple &apos;s standard .
and <unk> , if someone write a <unk> -- what happens everyday -- i say , &quot; leak me . &quot;
but when i looked at the most disruptive technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and others in the <unk> species of digital technologies , i made very much about the <unk> species .
and to limit the risks of this new stuff , we ultimately have to limit the ability to be the individuals that they &apos;re essentially given the access to the <unk> .
i think the challenge we face are -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is the : will we use this <unk> with the back that we &apos;re using this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you have , you have all kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a hint of the last of little firms fund -- it &apos;s <unk> to 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s quite remarkable for us .
and if you exercise the concept of <unk> , you can make a much more <unk> resource -- the resource of the market -- to deliver feedback loops .
12 years ago , i began to be fascinated with me , and i shifted my research in this direction .
wonderful and so swift things .
there are ice underneath the surface .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form of form of life .
it &apos;s even so much energy for biology in this cave that there are actually a large number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we found a few years ago that these are many characteristics that are used to have been used by the people and other organisms that they used to be regarded as habitat .
whenever you have to get a goal , to its whole , have to make certain steps , a certain way to be taken .
and this is also in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
<unk> were made of being made , and it was suffering from tremendous <unk> .
so , before we start able to digitize the <unk> , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by the electrons of the light , they give x-rays .
this was a bad idea , because <unk> from <unk> had a son called alexander &apos;s big , and they lost the battle of <unk> .
because at the moment , they &apos;re <unk> , their data and stuff .
the original owners of the bottle was one of most <unk> <unk> of the 18th century .
i said , 160 dollars for what ?
it has four balconies .
a <unk> pattern is that many of those things are from japan -- they &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was an object that i couldn &apos;t get into the finger , and that was the <unk> cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my flavor the one -- so it &apos;s not necessarily important that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one .
this year , this year , a virtual airplane was sold out of <unk> real dollars .
the really interesting thing in virtuality is that you can measure it .
now , i could develop a game with the name of the name , by just to get a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if you &apos;re real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely key and virtuality is amazing .
and i want to tell you a quick story , so 1999 -- there was a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed through the psychological and <unk> insights that we can get when we watch people playing playing .

this is a <unk> that i got to get two years ago , which was one of the most largest projects i &apos;ve ever involved in and my company .
but i &apos;m going to just step on the beginning of the process , three very <unk> .
if we are so good at what we &apos;re doing , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an architectural manifestation that are absolutely <unk> through the <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
the architectural practice was , <unk> , it &apos;s simple .
and this is the actual concern .
the second technology we did , we use things that they know from the <unk> of the opera .
here you see the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk today about how to collect stories , in a sense of something .
one of those projects is about a year and a half years old .
so here are the images that automatically created .
as long as i &apos;m up , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows you the most exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . well , on .
a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if you thought about one year , what would you do the next 35 years of their life ?

during the one , he had told that he wanted to be , and he had a about a <unk> of a given .
don &apos;t understand me , &quot; just , has absolutely benefits .
and with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then the communication is limited .
very funny people , if the means that it means .
you don &apos;t do this .
if someone had seen in a black board in 1993 , the <unk> would have been a little bit different from the time of &quot; love story &quot; , but he felt understood what was the .
i &apos;m about the <unk> , i wanted to say if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week at the whitney <unk> , and also in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
afghanistan is not an existential threat for global security .
and the same is true for the troops .
instead , there was a <unk> of <unk> optimism .
diplomats dig in <unk> .
and finally , we have to understand that the secret of what we in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our 20th was to the big part of our practices -- in the very careful <unk> of our <unk> .
rory , they just mentioned the .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on one finger to show you in the sense of what it looks like .
there are also <unk> , the <unk> , but if they &apos;re these <unk> , they &apos;re used to use this for a different type of <unk> .
the <unk> . this is a hard problem for reasons that i &apos;m not going to be .
there &apos;s another , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is to lead to a is a very valuable information to lead to a general bad job .
so , i think it has minimal foods that we probably can do to make things .
and we decided that we &apos;re not going to think about the cost of what the costs should be thinking about the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that is called , &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t understand a lot of people who are not as you are .
so we can think of things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half , if i say that you don &apos;t believe in hospital , if you &apos;re going to be able to get to a front of the front of the front , no previous <unk> , mri and <unk> <unk> .
then he looks at the door of his students .
in a few years in the late 19th century , early 20th century , suddenly the doctor of the doctor trying to make a diagnostic , the <unk> .
and between the perception of the patients and the doctors in terms of the most successful care , a real relationship .
also , another experience that i did in texas , before i went to stanford , i felt .
the bad news : the very important thing we don &apos;t know . do you see ? you can &apos;t see it ?
i remember so many large , <unk> , very quiet eyes , which that ritual to me .
some call us <unk> , a more <unk> term .
in this case , we have a <unk> .
for you , here , there &apos;s a miracle !
and there was no to <unk> .
religious <unk> .
harder is to move the dead to an answer .
my friend simon <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , the book &quot; the big bang , etc .
and now you open your eyes .
you can open it completely open , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it turned me to think of that these guys , at least most of the most , knowledge , what they do for their livelihood .
everybody thought it was impossible .
you can produce any amount of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to be .
you don &apos;t need any .
hugo <unk> has invented the <unk> <unk> and middle class in venezuela . he was just being pushed .
and that &apos;s how it goes .
they connect people with each other .
the reason ? today &apos;s modern medicine uses a 60 years old .
there &apos;s a catch .
it &apos;s a <unk> times faster than 26 times less than less than 400 times less than a <unk> of the pancreatic cancer .
now my experience with the world &apos;s world is quite different .
so there is the figure of the character .
and why does sex care about babies , and why are babies are a erotic disaster ?
because in the , the secret of desire .
especially important to this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same thing -- particularly interesting is that there are no <unk> in desire .
this is your <unk> and <unk> , that &apos;s biology , natural instinct .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to take . this study needs curiosity , <unk> .
you know that there &apos;s a erotic space that every one alone .
other places in the country had similar rooms in the country .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfectly .
ok .
it &apos;s going to be played smaller rooms .
so , early <unk> have some of the <unk> .
so i asked me , &quot; ok , is this a model for design , the <unk> that we do ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; that &apos;s on me !
how do we solve the next three issues that i want to put here to language ?
albert einstein -- i &apos;m just going to tell you when i was in princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s in life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people .
he spoke from his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rarely have a powerful mind with so much , the <unk> of the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he argued .
i &apos;m not going to be about the <unk> of the <unk> .
but for that , you have to sit around 10 minutes and a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i was never in .
harvest <unk> .
with tears in the eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
in 2010 , a young woman is president <unk> , and he says , how they and their siblings , their parents died in war .
we go to rural areas and everything we do in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look at the <unk> of now and see that there &apos;s a <unk> girl , a <unk> , <unk> girl on this stage stage .
lg : pardon to .
licklider licklider &apos;s recognized , computers can do the necessary <unk> to make insights and making decisions .
each interaction is recorded by more and more sensors : your credit card , your credit card , your computer credit , your computer credit , and we get the opportunity to understand our presence .
these records were human <unk> .
by a <unk> process , which is a a job for 40 months , was a simple task for three people , for three people . all this is <unk> .
we should stop seeing it outside .
for dinner with my wife and the children .
people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t have time to be , you &apos;re going to be .
she became a much bigger dog than i thought .
this is the implications of all of us .
the boom of the national <unk> of the national <unk> of our problems .
think of <unk> , <unk> .
in the age of katrina , we have more in common .
and they probably all have done that , and if not , you have to have it .
help me green , and help me green , help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch , to make an interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m just skeptical about what these <unk> .
in this case , you take a <unk> , put it on a pile and the pile of <unk> , the behavior of the different characters in a game or a story , in this case , the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can program to code to learn .
when kids like <unk> projects like projects like projects like projects , they &apos;re important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk to today is the context of the thing that cars are the way that cars are .
i want to talk about that .
and i think that this idea that great cars are a soul , very useful , all you know . you &apos;re all know . you see a car with a soul , and you know how much it is .
this is one of my favorite <unk> that really describes our relationship with the cars .
right ? and they decided that it was cheaper to be a studio and six or seven <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very close to this day , we broke up and <unk> , and we <unk> the concept of the true nature of the true of true and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring him to boston .
i have just a little laboratory .
now , we have a clinical trials in four <unk> of this disease .
we have no team of <unk> and <unk> that can get us this pharmaceuticals that we can get to the market .
it &apos;s 100 billion is the only number you have to know .
what you have to think is that we have to do it with a universe with a hundred billion stars , with the hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explain , was why entropy was ever low .
contrary to low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to that , we have a good theory that can explain that , if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , it &apos;s going to be going to continue the universe forever , and ordinary matter and radiation can be <unk> , always a certain level of radiation , some thermal thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give the big fluctuations .
it keeps going .
it &apos;s a <unk> fact of the universe that you &apos;re taking and not question .
i had never been using a computer .
it was a future that i couldn &apos;t .
now i want to do something to all the way out there , like me , to the african and the poor who are struggling with their dreams .
no matter what drives me in my real world was just <unk> with my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in the years .
i took this very literally , and i took it to my <unk> , and put it a little bit of a little bit of <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> .
the camera understands not just my movements , but also , can also understand what things i think in my hand .
and why only <unk> ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is about my learning in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is the third largest park in rio , june .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig down below the earth to build a stop .
so i &apos;ll give you a quick example .
almost every year we have this horrible <unk> .
we are below average in terms of the <unk> of the city .
a city of the future is a city that anybody can be from this great community , which cities are .
the best answer is to try and find a darwinian <unk> of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is , you make it beautiful , so that it &apos;s sort of a kind of replicating , so that it &apos;s fun to make it , you just watch it .
and some are in any case to large , to use it for butchering battles .
our strong reaction to images , to the expression of feelings in art , to the beauty of the night sky , and our offspring are , as long as the human race exists .
now , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see the computer in the environment , and since you can &apos;t see the structure , we actually see the driver with red leds , so he can actually see what &apos;s going on .
so , if mark can &apos;t get .
or for blind people , in everyday devices in the home , in the office and office .
a subtle <unk> , the <unk> , that normal people don &apos;t hear voices , and i heard them , he said that something didn &apos;t agree with me .
my psychological <unk> was a catalyst for <unk> , <unk> and physical and <unk> and <unk> , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , you would be better because cancer is easier to treat cancer . &quot;
to <unk> , if social change starts , it can &apos;t be more <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that we should look for life , rather than on mars , but there &apos;s also a lot of <unk> and more interesting .
and the usual astronomers were in contempt of it .
because it &apos;s the way that life can live in the life of life , it has tremendous benefits to life on a planet .
there was another item , this high <unk> of furniture with creatures and <unk> and naked -- pretty much of a little kid .
the first projects came up , but they took technology and turned it into things that people can use in a new way and maybe a new function of the .
the other thing that is the <unk> is to <unk> , is that we decided to make the whole technical <unk> of this whole , and trying to make it as beautiful as possible .
so we called it y , so that &apos;s another example of all the combined in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas that brand brand is that it &apos;s all tightly intertwined intertwined .
this is my <unk> anthony , in switzerland , he had the laptop for the afternoon , i had to take it back to a afternoon , and it was hard .
yves behar on the design of the design of objects stories stories

then then the situation will be able to be .
they have to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation , which are in a world where everything is in the middle of our best conversations on a screen .
finally , it could mean that they could print their own medicine .
and if you wonder why it &apos;s the most interesting , then you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia because it &apos;s a country that is very close between the <unk> .
maybe there are some of the things that some of the things that are bad traditions and they need changes .
so let me give you an example of one : in turkey , where i &apos;m from , which is a very <unk> republic , we had a very <unk> republic , until recently , i &apos;d be the <unk> that should protect the universities , against <unk> students .
now if i think the only person that thinks that this is , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as an example , as an example , they have seen , they were independent , <unk> .
and that &apos;s why the e.u. , the efforts of turkey , to join the e.u. , within turkey , within the <unk> of the demographic &apos;s <unk> , while some <unk> countries were .
there &apos;s a very large nose that doesn &apos;t seem to seem to seem to seem to be able to be connected to something .
if scientists today , a century , a century , you want to make neurons , then let &apos;s get off from the inside , and then you &apos;re going to make this from the inside of the .
carl <unk> : glimpses of the inside of our brains
but this trend is actually less .
but for many parts of africa , it has a colleague of me so <unk> , &quot; the <unk> on the tuesday morning , was voted on the right time so that the genocide on the table was beginning to start . &quot;
and instead of having this opportunity to have local leaders and international leaders come up and <unk> , and they went from the second <unk> , the events of the <unk> , and the wars in the <unk> and in iraq .
restorative design requires a strong focus on the <unk> , <unk> thinking and <unk> and <unk> .

mo <unk> from canada , from the united states , and from england , and we said , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i say , &quot; last year , we had the lucky to have <unk> <unk> . &quot;
this kind of entertainment , men involved in participate in every age , is so important and important , and i think , as much more important than the resources we collect .
he could see what his forest was happening , his environment , because his grandfather took him under his <unk> when he was just two years and began to teach him about the forest and the way of his people to teach .
when i thought about it , i wonder what our grandkids and our <unk> would say , if they ask a question .
we need new models of a leader and human being our world .

or maybe he was just an yogi that sitting on a rock and the skies of the sky , and the sun and the moon .
and if you &apos;ve been living in a life , you will get to the <unk> , or what the french call it , &quot; -- -- the skies of the <unk> .

you know , he &apos;s been building the largest building , she &apos;s called &quot; big . . &quot;
&quot; why i chose this way , why don &apos;t you care about , i &apos;m just going to get me . &quot;
<unk> <unk> opens us the eyes of the view of the myths of the world of india and west -- and shows why these <unk> systems of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of us , and the <unk> of us , and the <unk> of the <unk> of us , and the <unk> of us , and the <unk> of us , and the <unk> of us , and the <unk> of us , and the <unk> of us , and the <unk>
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 and the world , &quot; i &apos;m completely , completely competent , &quot; to <unk> himself with the <unk> praise .

it costs a <unk> of special education to be an expert in the normal <unk> of a <unk> .
some women who are breast cancer , die , many years later , a lot of years later , and fortunately most of them survive .
so , <unk> <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of power .
we bring this to go to the <unk> of the way to see what they &apos;re building .
mill .
they have slept in this <unk> .
this is a <unk> vision .
it &apos;s a question of the consequences .
so let &apos;s get to the point .
what did i do ? i heard my stomach ?
that &apos;s interesting . this is a different way to think .
the <unk> is basically a visual pattern of a human being , where any body body is proportional to the surface of the surface that he &apos;s in the brain .

ue : no . that &apos;s just smoke .
i &apos;m going to meet with some scientists .
and that &apos;s why i had the hope that by taking some natural elements , a little bit of a fog , i could make the space tangible .
<unk> is that it &apos;s a difference whether you do something or not .
the big mountains in the distance are going to move .
how do we have a idea that is both tolerance to individuality , and also to <unk> , without two different directions ?

we found very quickly that we had a system that connects people together .
today , this is the first time you &apos;re talking about this topic .
this is a picture of me and my daughter on top of the israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , do a poster with me . &quot;
they came and it was so many . i remember that <unk> spoke with a psychologist and him said , &quot; who will see ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;

and we saw this guy , <unk> ,

so what i &apos;m <unk> is , really , to say that we have a very long time , a situation where we &apos;ve had a number of choices .
and then you ask why economists ?
but it &apos;s what we &apos;re doing to do about it , very much , too high cost .
the <unk> malaria is a few million infected in a year .
what happens here is that we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good film in terms of that i want him to see him , right , but don &apos;t expect to <unk> in his next film brad pitt &apos;s <unk> , like it in tanzania , or something like that .

the <unk> isn &apos;t that right on their place .
we &apos;re going to be what really cared about .
it was released six months ago , and you get in germany .

i think it looks very easily looking for human skin , which is me .
but i think it could be a fairly sustainable and sustainable supplement to our <unk> resources .
chinese workers are not going to <unk> in factories because of our <unk> demand for ipods .
just because a person spend your time with it , a piece of something that doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s going to be a piece of something .
min &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; some of you understand that . you understand nothing . &quot;
this is the <unk> , the <unk> , my family on the way home to her family .
the taliban are going to do their schools .
if any kid in this is hit this rules , it &apos;s <unk> hard .
if i &apos;m to be the <unk> suicide bombers , as i , or in my age , i &apos;m so inspired by her <unk> .
and this one is going to come up there , from <unk> , from <unk> , hopefully , the one at some point in the future future , specifically equipped to pursue that question .
is the internet actually a place that you can see ?
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started trying to deal with it , was just a cable along the african west coast , shown here in this map of steve &apos;s song as thin black line .
and that seems to me .
this data will be put on the device on the device , starting with the foundation of the product , and put it on layer on layer by the new <unk> in a <unk> process on the old layer of the old game .
it was produced by the layers of layers of layers of about four .
an repulsion will probably be less likely .
they can just make it directly .
here &apos;s the product .
without any doubt , i think that this technology is a revolution in production and the <unk> of the way we know .
he was concerned that when he called her name , especially in the public , you could think he would be the legacy of jihad .
they &apos;re using their <unk> .
the good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be that .
but many of those factors that have a role , but now , the last work is done .
i was susan <unk> , the <unk> , in the mathare valley of the slums .
she said , &quot; you know , the poverty didn &apos;t know , it was the <unk> and the embarrassment of the whole thing . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to miss the violence or the drugs ? lack of privacy ?
one , instead of months instead of months , and forget about months ago , was a lot of <unk> .
but it &apos;s less likely that they remain .
and during my first year , i began my company .
it &apos;s actually that more energy needed to be required to make a solar cell , than they &apos;re going to be in their entire <unk> .
solar cells , but a half hours of light .
they also stand under large pressure , and are therefore dangerous .
this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , the generator and all the <unk> in its <unk> , and this is the hot <unk> , the hot cylinder at the top -- this part will be hot , that &apos;s going to be hot , and it comes electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can cool cool .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a <unk> , that we have the energy as fast as we do it .
we bubbles it up and we look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory that we did in the region of this molecule in the region of this molecule .
but i &apos;ve been writing bad poetry , and he never stopped the <unk> in the air , but he went to cuba .
so , from <unk> , great things can happen -- -- from whom i &apos;m going to end up a picture that eventually will end up in my work .
i &apos;m working for the new yorker , and i &apos;m doing <unk> , and then the 11th , and that was , , , a <unk> end of the world as we knew it .
then , &quot; you know , clearly , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> with the tongue , but that we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his <unk> had to be extinct . &quot;
this man is mad because someone all over the <unk> <unk> , and basically -- you know , <unk> , seem to be here .
and she also came out with george <unk> , so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s not .
td : since my youngest childhood and after , i got a lot of different obligations , and when i was young , i felt that my journey was already <unk> .
that &apos;s beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process should be in the inner level .
td : lakshmi worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , but i mean , , but i was actually the other thing that she has done , and i was pretty much more resistant to this week .
in those two examples , we have seen machines that have been studying machines that have been studying , and others who actually have learned in the reality .
if i say , &quot; we , &quot; i mean the advice for the <unk> .
but nobody thinks it &apos;s actually be very effective in the fact that it &apos;s a real outbreak .
the most part of the expenses in the bush administration is actually more in relation to anthrax and the threat of <unk> .
we know that the virus will mutate . it will be a different virus .
but in the scientific community , there is a <unk> debate about what percentage of the <unk> between people and coughing and how much about the hands are happening .
some of the poorer countries that most experienced at the most experience with h5n1 , have been the <unk> of drugs that are already up .
and i think , even our leaders would say , in this case , we would have a lot of doing a lot of them .
i &apos;m looking forward to answer your questions .
our centers for <unk> have been a of them -- as fast as a <unk> .
and in the most cases , in humans , they were similar bacterial infections , and they were no problem .
just don &apos;t pay attention to how much fun you have it , but also how the <unk> <unk> is completely changed the way to interact with a city like san francisco .
please put a <unk> on a <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> with a young juggler , a <unk> juggler , and he <unk> one of the three clubs .
since my childhood , i played with <unk> and climbing , so , the case is done . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
manhattan is not in infinite .
so , if i &apos;m not going to be here , right ?
i &apos;m going to stay in the middle .
she was one , i was to the triumph .
because of the <unk> petals and limbs are very dark and very quiet .
i and my colleagues of the <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that live in the woods .
we &apos;re looking at the media , we have a <unk> ; we have <unk> .
and then students come to our <unk> , and they have their own <unk> with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn how to take the frog to <unk> <unk> , which is a rural extinct of the endangered species in the states of washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; see what you &apos;re hidden in front of you . &quot;
therefore , we see a rising demand for <unk> , and therefore , therefore , we see a rising demand .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
i was really , i was really important about this day .
the deeper we go down below water , the higher is the pressure .
so i started doing this about 15 years ago .
when the air is the air in the <unk> , the air is coming from the <unk> .
so any of the computer can do the entire system , so if two of them are out there , there are some uninhabited .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat keeps progressively progressively over many miles .
so sharks aren &apos;t quite as dangerous as most people are doing it .
when we found it , we didn &apos;t even know what family was saying , we called him <unk> , because he looked like he looked like he looked like him .
they &apos;re <unk> , and he <unk> .
this means that every one of you know at least a child that &apos;s suffering from a <unk> disorder .
and its communication and social interaction has been expanding so much that he could visit a normal school and even a <unk> .
he &apos;s kind of like life : if you &apos;re in , you can &apos;t get back again .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him , but remember this day , one day , you &apos;ll hear you &apos;re going to hear , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he &apos;s been dying before .
he had a lot of love , he loved everyone .
we all have , all of us , are what happens when a <unk> of hydrogen and helium so long , that you start to wonder about their origins .
and this <unk> show that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to be the diversity and the incredible size of life on this planet , in the first step , to truly learn how to communicate in a contact with life in all of the .
it &apos;s kind of as important as aluminum aluminum , and we &apos;re going to expand it by 350 antennas , so it &apos;s more sensitive and moore &apos;s law is the elevated input .
and then we would like to look for the <unk> search for human health care .
many people say , it &apos;s the best place in the world to study the development of climate change .
so every cylinder is a <unk> of time .
while they &apos;re <unk> with the ice , they put a little bit of gloves in an oven , so you can put a new pair of gloves , if your <unk> <unk> your your fingers are stiff .
i think that &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , a little bit of a <unk> .
and our soldiers don &apos;t look at the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , if they actually have the service to <unk> american <unk> .
you can keep this further , and efficiency almost triple to a number of <unk> improvements and therefore the size of the big <unk> .
we could build more cars , which would make security , but it should be easily .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan , because we have our <unk> <unk> , and the other ones aren &apos;t .
and by the <unk> of the <unk> mass , the <unk> mass of these kinds of materials , or in this case , to make <unk> , as good <unk> , the <unk> can be able to do it as it was the way that the internet has gone back to the internet .
it can &apos;t just be a huge <unk> approach .
there were two kinds of negative feedback that we have .
let &apos;s think that it really is going to be stable .
<unk> , i &apos;m wrong .
at the end , he found a <unk> , a dutch <unk> named soviet meegeren , who made a lovely vermeer sold to a prize that &apos;s about 10 million dollars .
according to his <unk> , he looked like he was discovered , as he was discovered , it &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it comes to it . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive they find them how much they get to sexually or romantic , depends on what you think of who you &apos;re looking at .
but each of those three objects has a value beyond what it is a leading one , because of its history .
but i don &apos;t want to copy , even if i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he put joshua bell bell , he would take his <unk> in a subway station in washington d.c. , to take up to a corner , and see how much money he &apos;ll take .
the second shock hurts less because you &apos;re a little bit of it .
and if you zoom in , you can see that there &apos;s a kind of political <unk> .
they <unk> that she &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of the american <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is very glamorous and exciting .
and what you can find is , of course , is that people who eat vegetables and olive olive olive oil , fewer <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most amazing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> conclusion when you give a drug in such a high dose that it &apos;s more side effects , and that your new drug is going to be .
the big ones are closer to the true answer .
that &apos;s a problem for this , for this point .
and very soon they would have begun to <unk> this coal , 2,000 2,000 , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , back to china and all over the world .
can you imagine how you would feel like you were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know that , all knowledge .
there &apos;s this thing that the <unk> of the world , and the one is from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man , the americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
they generalize . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are the chinese , and everybody else are chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of you woke up to his child , and she &apos;s <unk> , and said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back after .
it has changed .
and all this has been enormous implications of the world .
i think thomas jefferson jefferson did this very well .
for the <unk> of the audience , even though , why are a major budget of a greater budget , and that &apos;s because of <unk> <unk> in other languages and cultures , so the market for those films are bigger .
but it will happen in this century .
this is not the most of the united states , which is about a million , but gdp per capita gdp per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
also , as everybody knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a lifetime that &apos;s growing up on the gulf of the gulf of the <unk> .
a lot of our actions on this planet that are focused on our living environment , just by faith and desire .
it &apos;s been a for thousands of years or millions of years .
we need to calm down before we &apos;re going to ruin the planet .
e.o. wilson : the life of life on earth
another <unk> is the famous european <unk> .
the genome of the passenger pigeon contains 1.3 billion base base .
the inversion of extinction is falling into this particular category .
real <unk> of light is slightly <unk> chickens .
it &apos;s a program for the <unk> , which is just brilliant .
this is an emotional theme . some people are up .
my grandmother was a <unk> .
i also made my own comic books , which was another way to tell stories , by words and through images .
and we sat in a moment , in silence and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
so use your own style . draw &apos;t like you tell you .
&quot; better , , i have your <unk> .
i &apos;m also going to publish a book book called &quot; <unk> police <unk> : the <unk> who <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us all the physiological , psychological , cognitively , and <unk> .
this is a 32 million pounds of cheap , important <unk> , which was built recently in britain , designed by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by this .
people who say , don &apos;t let the team up beside this team because the noise like and the other quiet need to do .
&quot; upwake &quot; &quot; upwake &quot; a story about zero , a contemporary business of life that &apos;s life in the suitcase , and the between a dream and and and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and not able to get the same to the .
<unk> <unk> and a half years and a half years and a half later , what was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
i know that theater connects us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create a smart important important and unusual , and <unk> .
if you look around the bathroom , you see some products like , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also toothpaste .
<unk> collagen -- or since the 1970s , the collagen of the pigs -- it &apos;s used to inject it in fold .
in fact , i found 185 products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid you have a long time and a half of a year .
i said , you should say , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they have given me feel that one , in a time , i felt like a one in which one of them felt like a one .
they &apos;re just working on the <unk> performance , so she <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> , and now the letters is the letters .
and hundreds of verbs can behave .
you can see that as the language of thought , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why are the <unk> , <unk> requests , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are often being <unk> .
you can try to imagine what if language could be just literally used literally .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with this .
here &apos;s my argument . it &apos;s it ? is it good ?
it &apos;s doing it . it &apos;s <unk> .
what do you know , you know , you won me that ?
all of those different roles . you can imagine an argument that you &apos;re in the room , but also in the audience , and you see yourself in the audience and see yourself in the middle of the ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most part part of me : we want them to <unk> in the world of nature . we bring a <unk> and finding the masters of the <unk> in nature that might inspire us to .
it changed everything . from there , these engineers weren &apos;t going to be in the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the <unk> national laboratory .
it would be <unk> for cells cells if they could go without a <unk> .
this is not easy , because life is just a subset of the elements in the <unk> .
feeling and react to say , feedback .
what you can &apos;t see , you cannot count .
my first business was a <unk> . i began under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia are almost half a million companies .
because , as from the <unk> , smaller <unk> in direct context of the <unk> are .
and the world in the world are not exceptions .
people are <unk> whether this <unk> and this kind of <unk> .
i have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , himself <unk> cows on my <unk> &apos;s day , and i want to use paper paper paper paper .
we first got it off .
what does that mean ?
when i began to deal with them , i realized that they were incredibly well adapted .
but the researchers had a problem .
until they finally went off and the campus -- and certainly happy to come there -- some of the time later , and discovered that the crows are still in .
we &apos;ve figured out they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other .
<unk> for example , you would come to the peanut , looking for the peanut .
but there were three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about , but more importantly , i &apos;ve found a <unk> .
who would ever put it ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region could offer something .
so let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the <unk> of the future , you have to understand .
that &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny <unk> of the sound .
about 10 million <unk> each one .
and here we see , in the words of the parliament israel , &quot; how the hand of the penis in a way that is remembered to <unk> . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i would not be eating until end , if you &apos;re not about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should do an experiment .
he had a line in his book that was supposed to be out of the <unk> , and there was a <unk> maria <unk> , the trouble with conception .
now , you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said , because i think it &apos;s so beautiful .
i think that i think i &apos;m very unfortunate . not because i want to use it . i wanted to see him .
and this is actually the beginning of our history .
now , i would have thought to that moment , that age of 50 , one of the things that i really understood was to bind my shoes .
i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know where to be the different colors .
but i can see in their face that they &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have a little bit fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i &apos;ll put a few things in the room .
and now , you &apos;re all here in there .
so my dad was , my adolescence was interesting interesting .
the song as the mere fact .
i &apos;m going to say , &quot; wait , &quot; wait , it &apos;s good , i put the wheels , &quot; <unk> protest , i bought the <unk> wheels , and i put it on and -- you know , i &apos;ll have my <unk> ?
it just sounds , but i think we &apos;re in our society and culture with the <unk> of the <unk> .
he had designed the <unk> himself , and he was really quite proud of it .
human , i love the thing .
the consequences of a planet , on the already seven billion people .
and particularly proud of the cushy seat , he was the very simple chair he had been given his <unk> , and the beautiful round of the front lines around the seat .
intent -- a life of intent -- in fact , is , in fact , the original slightly better .
i saw the the whole of the the mass of a left and i swore that she was lost , <unk> , all of the things i didn &apos;t do yet , but not possible .
then i began to be wondering how many times ago , how my life would be different if this man had not injured at the time my genes had a different different experience in experience .
i was , but i was , but i was a <unk> myself , and i suspect , i suspect , i was going to myself .
i had a lot easier to trade on something much simpler : this <unk> <unk> of four words and i put back to my way back to my way .
he spent six months in jail , lost his <unk> for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we work with the machine <unk> laboratory at the university of california , san diego together .
first , the perception of people , and secondly , a natural interface , a natural form of control , so that the interaction with the robot is to be intuitive .
and yet , i made this idea of my own .
so , after i realized this economic danger , i thought we have to find a solution to this problem .
some have even been estimated to the speaker of nathan <unk> way to speak , or the one of tim ferriss who may be seen as a realist .
i don &apos;t know tedtalk that includes this .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i thought the problem was a little bit harder .
and yet , there was one of the things that all of you were : the expansion had to slow down .
bear the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the head , because i &apos;m going to call you three <unk> of string theory .
the <unk> went up at about 10 to the <unk> .
and he was working on this number of describing this number , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of those universes have added dimensions .
because astronomers from today , by making powerful telescopes to the sky , a handful of photons , photons -- sort of a kind of <unk> <unk> , billion years .
now , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it , and we want to do it , but you &apos;re really excited and more curious .
he said , &quot; go , milo . <unk> them . &quot;
pm : this is dimitri &apos;s right in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know anybody here .
so the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the television television , the sea &apos;s <unk> , the united television is in the street .
it was a very popular meeting of reporters who have been working on war , the staff of ngos , and of course , the fearless , brave people of sarajevo .
if i asked , why i keep doing , why i &apos;m going to stay on , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my work of this statement , and this is the <unk> , the core of the thing , for us to be reporters for us .
even before a goal appears to be a destination , and she &apos;s trying to find the goal of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where it is .
basically , we &apos;re the animals so that they learned to explore these <unk> and objects in the virtual world .
in an experiment we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju was the <unk> .
please ask your hand .
the last reason has to do that , that women are part of the solution , not the problem .
in the seriousness , in the average , one of seven women in childbirth a child .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> when he <unk> the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good for the investment of girls in the developing world . &quot;
this is bill &apos;s book .
and this was the feather of a bird .
this whole layer of the gyre is a single of our <unk> tells us that there &apos;s a <unk> .
and even this picture , the strange idea of the funny sense of being <unk> -- how something of the <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> circus .
one of those possibilities was that we can actually have a <unk> .
they put their fates to say , &quot; i want to trade this with the finished <unk> arrows . we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where you can all the three or four miles to a new language .
if 27 individuals from those 27 member of the table , they were 23 languages , then they tell you a single bill that you need an armed army from <unk> <unk> to be prepared to all the possibilities of all the possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they have language language .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is invisible space between a text and the other image , and how the image is changed through the text , and the text through the image .
this is <unk> <unk> , which is the bottom of the atlantic ocean and north america .
they &apos;re going to turn the negative .
but by the idea of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> can change the <unk> .
larry <unk> was eight years a 10 and a half of <unk> <unk> , in arizona , for kidnapping and <unk> <unk> a <unk> boys on a <unk> .
before , people are left themselves .
and they &apos;ve taken them for us to get here for the .
and now , you drive the <unk> with the <unk> , where it &apos;s in that moment .
it &apos;s just the vast length of space that is so much as a positive thing .
something called a feeling , &quot; addicted to happiness and human design .
partly lies at the legacy of the <unk> , which is the pursuit of happiness for the <unk> of the individual , and cannot be found in the realities .
a <unk> of the science of happiness is that happiness and no <unk> in a closed feature .
it starts in the <unk> of the <unk> .
here &apos;s a three year-old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to increase the status , that is dominance .
i want to close with a few quotes .
why would you choose rats ?
once the rat understood it , we make the problem a little bit .
you can actually cure for t.b. , even in people who are hiv-positive .
with the knowledge that a patient , the microscopic <unk> remains to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- per year , can you can be sure that we already have a lot of life .
here we see neurons .
so it &apos;s important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question is : if i just watch how a person &apos;s being touched , why am i not confused , and literally this <unk> of the naked watching how someone &apos;s being touched ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
it &apos;s not about the <unk> , but it &apos;s the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken through a <unk> <unk> by the way in kew .
even each one of us have a story to tell us a story of the <unk> .
we have to be as well as the breast cancer to tackle this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980s , when we were women and death , and death up and death , they wrote an editorial for the new england journal of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington d.c. , d.c.
we decided to look , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , x-ray , <unk> , for women whose <unk> <unk> the heart of the heart , every time we &apos;re modeling , that &apos;s just a little bit of a little bit of a few radiation , we &apos;re asking : &quot; is this test ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they &apos;ve done what they said they have <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> .
the cells have something like <unk> , in the dish , they don &apos;t feel native .
what does that mean for us ?
over three years , we took eight to 10 hours to 10 hours of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> that came out of a year ago , which really surprised us .
and finally , my son is playing in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> roy &apos;s here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in play .
this is the first time that our son has more than two steps -- captured in the movie .
and this is an important thing to be a question , because the better understand how the brain works meaning , the better we can communicate , and i think the better we can think and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to the . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is we &apos;re trying to paint our teams and paint the whole <unk> of the whole wave of the whole wave of the whole of the <unk> .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just polio , but also , the way for relaxation .
so there &apos;s not a .
if you translate this into the building industry , if you have a <unk> , and a window is broken , we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we continued to set .
are we just stupid ?
you can have <unk> in two years when you read eight hours a day .
so , you can <unk> in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why do you not do that , and why do you not do that ? &quot;
and the police are waiting to get the the department of the car department to make the car into the room to get the body of the driver .
and that &apos;s enough to the present to the present , in the united states , on the one of the one of the <unk> of the divine .
all of this leads to us -- <unk> , just to name the time , what we &apos;re doing most of the things we &apos;re doing to use digital tools .
this is the implication of the world of more than a third of the brain on the right side of the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be out of the healthcare system .
he stopped then , in the right position , he would fall my teeth .
so alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and inventor who &apos;s fascinated to close the difference in the conscious mind , whether he &apos;s a deaf hearing or a blind thing , or a blind thing that sees the movement .
now , i had to find in the dark years , and they would figure out what was going to me when everything that was doing this today .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and this was the developing world : they had big families and a relatively quick life .
and those are on this page . a large <unk> of africa and the ones .
and then deng xiaoping came and bring money to china and bring the country back to a middle place .
a search search , which we can copy the data into a <unk> format and worldwide , and what are we going to hear if we &apos;re looking around us ?
but this is what this is making .
you know , darwin has the life , after it turned out , what was the essence of life ?
and i learned to know , francis crick .
there were the in the literature .
we weren &apos;t the best chemist in the room .
i was a unhappy , and my girls didn &apos;t get me .
you can actually compare to dna to the same <unk> and <unk> areas .
and so i &apos;ll end up by telling us that we &apos;ve been looking at at schizophrenia .
in average , the rate costs of the , the rate of two million dollars , and takes 18 months when they win .
one , fighting not the patent , but against the patent .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;ll going to go back with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; &quot; asked the girls .
the dads were in a place where they were their daughters to play their chairs and their hand could reach out .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left left in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in human beings .
you cannot see the enemy most of the time . and so , we have a different approach to eradicate polio than we did it with smallpox .
it helped control the pandemic of control , sars for example .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how we get polio to a standstill
dj : so , we found this <unk> of all kinds of animals , especially with the big cats .
and to our astonishment , it became a <unk> .
for us , this elephant in many ways , a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of the hope that we &apos;re accompanied with our work .
it was amazingly amazing than she took it in safety , to protect it from the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these <unk> , the <unk> , it reminds me in a very difficult way of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny lies in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman , as a community and as part of the planet and we have to continue it .
it seems obviously , it seems to be obvious that the earth is large and <unk> , the sun &apos;s tiny and even portable . but it &apos;s worth what <unk> <unk> is going to be .
and this is because in middle middle world is always there .
nature of this model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there are many of them , and because between you don &apos;t agree with you , there are no consensus about their favorite <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , as we see it in middle world , <unk> and regulations .
people as being a machines may be in treat scientific and <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> time in time you want to figure out what the most fulfilling person next .
over night , i was going to be the <unk> <unk> at the same age of 40 .
so , about a <unk> , i &apos;m controlling my head , allowing me to see the <unk> of the robot and send the to the way i &apos;m making buttons in a <unk> .
with the help of people like you can do this dream .
so in the oceanography , for example , a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> is developed by basically the <unk> that are revealing dolphins .
i think we can create a global community together .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
now there are some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from it .
but we don &apos;t usually do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also assume that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- what is really sad , if you think this is now the most common language on the internet .
what are you going to look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this image , you might think , &quot; why should i be interested in all ? &quot;
but there are all those different techniques that allow us to go out and see the world and find out of it .
they would bring wealth and safety , religious violence and make sure that states never have the <unk> .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is this ?
i love this court .
and the war was , the 20 million people started life life -- to the world war ii in the world .
<unk> sen , who is this guy : &quot; i should have all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all of this time to look at the american man who had my prescription .
chinese restaurants have mostly done the same thing , i think , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the company -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which in fact , in new york city in the early &apos; 60s , when i was in new york city in the early &apos; 60s , so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , the <unk> search for medicine is the same way to do the same .
so people would have a really big deal .
when the <unk> started getting less to become less , i was obviously <unk> , until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work .
do you remember than a child to all of the line ?
18 and 19 sleep , i slept the night .
and again , i &apos;ll be a little depressed and something that &apos;s a bit frustrated .
many of us , it &apos;s clear that there are a lot of us in the next few years in building a better world .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world of the treatment of the known problems that made from the potential of the and climate change ?
if you &apos;re the impossible , you can do it .
but we have a deal with climate change .
and there was god .
the <unk> power is a remarkable remarkable : they use two ingredients , protein and water that are in their lines to create a material that is as much as a responsibility is to create a material that is as much as a <unk> as kevlar .
or you &apos;re <unk> beautiful things like this , if the camera can capture .
here you see how it &apos;s taken from tissue .
with my new project , duke <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s the , and the round of applause and the <unk> -- hopefully not -- to help him some of his next decisions .
what should i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this unprecedented demonstration , heather knight <unk> <unk> a <unk> , which is far more than <unk> <unk> -- he collects the feedback of his audience and how to be the answers to the answers to the crowd of the crowd .
stanley yunus , inventor of the known <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , in the <unk> and <unk> that it would be a relationship between two to seven .
how does our view of relations in terms of relationships ?
there was a truism that i &apos;ll tell you , and where he could have to take that <unk> in the ear .
oh ... my dad , a <unk> ? !
it was his dad who decided they needed false papers .
this sense of responsibility over the life of the other age , despite 17 years , and his fault to be a <unk> , because he was in a camp , and he was stuck in a camp , and he was his friends , he kept his whole life .
and as my graduate student and my <unk> gave up , and i was having my father &apos;s wrong papers .
i asked him , the the the victim he had , whether he had ever been doing it .
we &apos;re growing up a few million people on the seven billion people we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> at <unk> level , which is a <unk> to the next <unk> , which is seemingly in a good condition .
if you &apos;re the forests , the border line of the <unk> , you &apos;re the ability to stay in the <unk> of the .
with the realization of <unk> , fishers , the <unk> of great <unk> reef , and scientists that the great deal of the great deal of the reef is the <unk> .
but the drama is , of course , is that it &apos;s not an option option .
so , leads to another reason why i &apos;m here : because i really like the media .
this is a <unk> of a race of a long time .
first , he &apos;s essentially using a ancient way of making the <unk> and connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new way to this time .
and through the process of sugar , i made portraits of them .
it became very large pictures , and i took them with a very large camera , a <unk> camera .
my interest in <unk> , especially worse , very much worse , it &apos;s enough .
on the back , a sequence is also in chimpanzees .
we can ask , &quot; is there any general differences between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of today &apos;s living .
we can then ask ourselves the same questions as for neanderthals : have you see yourself with ancestry &apos;s people who are today ?
there are many people who designing their own vision , such this vision of the 20th century .
and i think , for my belief , the airplane of the future is your own consciousness .
imagine , you &apos;re growing up in the 3d printer , and they &apos;re embedded in a <unk> , and consequences of the forces that are in their components .
they didn &apos;t speak . but most of all , they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would <unk> . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about one of a hundred .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that the research that you have been busy with , really , a really impact on the reality that they can actually have to prevent those experience that i had begun to have my way to this field .
then you pick up .
<unk> <unk> , you in a rigid position -- chin on the <unk> , arms <unk> over your <unk> .
they were doing all the way we had to teach them .
and after the battle , they get this mobile class , and they do what you call &quot; <unk> &quot; to teach you what you did wrong .
and people have changed .
i said , &quot; well , what is he now ? &quot;
that &apos;s not easy .
and she showed up on the left to tell me how problem was this image , which was the idea of it as black represented black .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the <unk> that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m doing .
now , this is a obvious statement on the top .
and the kids said , &quot; how do we do . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long do you have to do it before you decided you have nothing about it ? &quot;
their <unk> levels increases in 50 , which is the fine schools novel in delhi , in a <unk> biotechnology teacher .
76 percent . at the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
according to eight ted talks , he wanted to be <unk> .
that &apos;s 10-year-old .
suddenly i saw the darkness from the darkness on the <unk> side of the place , which were the the moon on the moon .
if i had to reduce the entire history on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life turned into a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand that .
so , blue , blue , everything is blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of play in africa .
it &apos;s one more that is the one of the things that are in the interface of health and shops .
so let &apos;s use the markets as the most iconic of the <unk> we have , and we figure out how price people would pay for the people so that they would have the dignity of choice .
thank you .
the <unk> was this : if my mother could not understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we were destroying two <unk> and 10 television television .
the little <unk> to take off from its tracks , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i would like to show you a video of a few of the models i work with .
tissue of <unk> density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually the key to use these models of <unk> .
thank you .
trying to get them just flying , like the attempt to shoot an arrow at the end of the end , it was tough work , and boy , boy , i have a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even more <unk> , as <unk> as <unk> -- with darpa , california institute of technology and university of the university of the university of technology .
be careful , behave like the wood or so , as you know , like wood .
now i didn &apos;t try to be <unk> .
they go forever .
that &apos;s over two billion .
it requires about three years after the estimate of three years .
don &apos;t forget that one of them .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we can understand in the human mind and machine can be able to win .
i have a lot of a lot of it . where do you come from ?
it &apos;s afraid that the way in the more <unk> in 20 to 30 years .
all of the evidence of this is that this cancer is being in a virus .
i took the opportunity to be true and took a few samples out of jonas &apos; tumor and some samples from other parts .
and she got him to the veterinarian and this one discovered .
ultimately , cancer is a <unk> suite of the ability of our cells to become the parts of their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would <unk> to wait for the waiting for .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low <unk> can &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t feel that the numbers on them .
i &apos;m first going to show you the <unk> for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken , if we &apos;re conscious of this <unk> .
but what we &apos;re in the 21st century is asia , which gradually gradually , to harbor over half of the world &apos;s population and over half of global performance .
you could look at this as the privatization of the <unk> .
after 800,000 , the soviets had the soviets , it was , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re in japan or new delhi or <unk> your view of china &apos;s being a little bit different than you live in beijing in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we &apos;re able to get this into more historical history , we &apos;ll be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests , so that it &apos;s not just a <unk> , but positive sum .
this is the conventional approach .
this has typically <unk> the responsibility to make a robust <unk> to guarantee a robust .
they &apos;re more on the long term .
for whom ? especially for young men ?
after the most of the most effective , the law is the , you can &apos;t even get .
the supply would be from the age of the , according to the conflict , government .
this is the <unk> of my hometown of my hometown .
the military has understood it . they call the world &apos;s <unk> , security security and stability as governments are talking about how to react to the world .
it allows you to get more productive , so that they can afford the insurance insurance .
these are certainly the examples of possible solutions that we feel about the way of making a <unk> world .
listen to how chinese students do english , they &apos;re shouting .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , abstractions , which we &apos;re trying to make logical , and we take the hypothetical seriously , that we &apos;re really asking ourselves more about what is .
luria was a thousand times before they were in the scientific age , and he found that this human beings were resistant to a <unk> of the concrete world .
and there said , &quot; at the north pole , it &apos;s always snow .
they chose <unk> instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively professions .
would you be being killed ? &quot;
you could say , a <unk> .
it feels like i landed in a hive of angels land . &quot;
and they <unk> me to do a degree of something .
he &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris did it with a personal sacrifice , this film .
i &apos;m one of your <unk> .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is serious .
we were all angry at them , &quot; why do you do this ?
it &apos;s much more real when you read it . &quot;
we had the game for weeks for weeks , about seven weeks ago , and we had essentially <unk> 50 <unk> crises .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
a lot of people announced , well , good jobs and <unk> the <unk> .
it &apos;s like your own connection .
if i put all three legs of this , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so , all you do is -- it &apos;s a very <unk> case -- this old <unk> , and this old piece of the <unk> , this <unk> <unk> is very simple in an old <unk> .
that &apos;s possible if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> paper -- you can be in a <unk> school or a state school -- a leaf , a piece , a <unk> , and a pen , no glue , no .
what we do is a very simple <unk> .
this is a little straw , which is , you know , this is the two corners of this , it &apos;s going to be like a <unk> .
here are two magnets .
it was very many of the passengers on the ship , and they were bored , so the captain would get the <unk> .
at the <unk> conference , <unk> <unk> , and yet amazing plans to transform waste in really <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which can build kids themselves -- as they learn basic principles of science and learning .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that many evidence .
and there are a few examples of projects that are conscious to mimic ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can get an area of traffic into a turn , the open space for people who connect people back with food and waste into opportunities .
this photograph was taken the day of when it was later , it looked like this .
if you &apos;re <unk> seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to go to the people of the people who are <unk> <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
i borrow somebody who is jew because i &apos;m jewish and i &apos;m very important .
but the actual <unk> was that there were a lot of men who wanted to go out .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with himself .
he like to go , unless it isn &apos;t on a <unk> .
i was basically trying to be like <unk> .
because you remember my <unk> : you have to reach a <unk> of 700 points , and nobody did this .
most of you are . <unk> are the average 33 years , not eight years , and if we look at the <unk> demographic of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the morning .
imagine , their sight is very , very good .
these <unk> have even a lot of other benefits in terms of attention , and a sense of attention that is also improved , is our ability to pursue objects in our environment .
so , i want to ask you to remember , to remember , to remember , to remember , and it &apos;s in the context of a different group of <unk> , a group that actually is highly interested in our society , which is the people who are doing the multimedia-tasking .
so let me step back with a project that is called the mental trajectory .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just take all kinds of programs of this particular case of the , if we look at .
so it was a big , very complex project , which i didn &apos;t even know if it works at all .
so wolfram alpha knows a lot of things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with its kind of more complex language and a large network of <unk> , , able to get a lot of them .
so , with physical <unk> , we &apos;re used to be used to the world and to realize that certain materials for certain technological , and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited at the discovery that there were candidate universes with amazingly simple rules that have a special theory of relativity and the general relativity and gravity and the end of relativity and the end of relativity and the least evidence to quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i actually lost more professional professional , and teachers who are me to <unk> hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
my mom was a woman , she had no right on a property of property , and i was owned by the family , anyway my dad , so he had the right thing .
and the day before the actual ceremony was dancing , we were excited , and they didn &apos;t have all the night .
he was wearing sneakers , and this one village , which didn &apos;t even have a <unk> streets . it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a <unk> girl , i would come back and do anything she would ask for me .
when it was pregnant before the marriage was pregnant , the mother was being pregnant and prosecuted .
as we speak here , you &apos;ll never be mutilated again .
consumers , the 72 percent of the american gdp , are actually , just like banks and companies &apos; companies to <unk> their <unk> , in everyday life , to liberate itself in everyday life , to liberate itself from the <unk> and risks that we face when we move forward .
and what you &apos;re looking at here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually <unk> and essentially future education , the future children of our households .
<unk> are the <unk> , the <unk> of the suffering from cornell .
we also observe a trend to something that &apos;s important . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and the emphasis on the neighbor for the .
we also see a big <unk> .
the trend to the <unk> is immense .
then we take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i came to the question , i &apos;m the only one that does this .
you could exploit it .
that &apos;s what i do in my life -- stories stories , novels , and today i want to write with you a few stories about the art of the narratives and also about some of the supernatural creatures that are <unk> .
our <unk> could shrink . our hearts could be <unk> , and our <unk> could be <unk> , if we were too long within our cultural cultural <unk> .
and i first came up with the first time i call it , &quot; representatives &quot; &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no refugee , or <unk> . i &apos;ll ask why i do . but the way between languages enabled me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge deal , because i was prosecuted .
it has to lead us to the other side .
i could be a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe it will be a happy story , and in my next book , i write about a <unk> , <unk> professor professor .
so you &apos;re . you &apos;re using existing songs , you just cut it into little bits , so it &apos;s sort of the pieces of the little bit , and you get a new song , but this new song is clearly made of old songs .
instead , these laws and laws worldwide is the rather unusual ones in the property .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;ll summarize what it does . <unk> alarm : the <unk> of the telephone , by combining a icon with his finger .
our creativity comes from outside , not from the inside .
and then you say , &quot; okay , but how do you know your address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper &quot; the guardian . &quot;
what beautiful is , you can probably see this limb in the way , sort of <unk> <unk> , which is the from the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
so this led to an understanding of nuclear structure , because it &apos;s so <unk> that atoms have a single nucleus , with <unk> , the orbit .
this picture shows a galaxy , a <unk> , , like , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it &apos;s ultimately , it can also be the <unk> ideas for us , about our place in the universe and really the value of our home home .
this is here . this is home . we &apos;re .
and with each click and every bit of the and every touch of the screen , as <unk> and <unk> <unk> of our personal information , all of our way through the digital forests .
when our daughter sat down to the <unk> , i asked her , &quot; will you have a lot of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t be <unk> by this .
now , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much about and talked , i decided to my 27 birthday , i decided that i couldn &apos;t speak more , just a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t speak ...
and i explained to help with a friend who would my sign of my language that i was john francis that i was going to be , and that this was the last time that somebody would be my language language .
anyway , i &apos;m going to go back to my backpack again .
i started talking back again because i had studied <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i was thought about my my husband , but never my decision , just to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found out little jobs in exchange for dinner .
i was always worried that i would be back and be back back back .
i felt like that , because i had so much food , but my father died of hunger .
but i believe that your gesture of love and caring about the life of another joseph &apos;s life , and thousands of other people can change the , and that have the hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much more powerful than i expected , and easily making it <unk> , and making a <unk> <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my graduate work as an architect because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for the society , but for privileged people , rich , the government , developer .
and then in the next year , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in the in the in the in the japan .
so i &apos;m asking , what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re going to learn some of the most important things in our life before we &apos;re born , even in the womb .
fetuses are even learning the particular language that &apos;s been talking about in the world that they &apos;re born in .
it &apos;s a mixture of influences that are so individually and curious , like the woman himself .
why should malnutrition have to be in the womb of debilitating disease ?
you can see , but you can see , but also see other eyes .
this is the trust in the <unk> of the <unk> , for any kind of <unk> .
the audience will <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is very logical , but not with what your eyes is happening . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , you may not be able to smile .
you may remember it as the <unk> <unk> , okay . at the time , as the biggest deal of all time .
if you &apos;re a <unk> of the <unk> , and somebody says , &quot; what does it do , &quot; what does it do for the eliminating hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an campaign ?
so this is actually a strategy and i don &apos;t argue that strategy plays a role .
for me , all the music .
so if i use my software software , the camera is the <unk> , and the position of the <unk> in relation to the <unk> , and you have an whiteboard .
i remember that the poor thing needed to be something -- eat , clothes , housing , housing -- what they didn &apos;t .
i actually felt a <unk> of shame .
now , i heard him , i was very excited for a very different reasons .
i didn &apos;t have a donation to a donation , which was really my way .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the history of the poor and it &apos;s about giving us a way to get a way of what their dignity would be , a relationship , which is a <unk> way of a donation , can happen .
it &apos;s a very large combination , a very strong combination .
now , the is the very first time , and it &apos;s really important to me , for me , it &apos;s just a vehicle , only one tool .
what does the future of humanity ?
now i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we ourselves , or is we live in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions that we &apos;ve done considerable progress in the last hundred years .
look at this .
here are photos of me .
the rate of even all 18 months and every <unk> member of the <unk> knows , that &apos;s the law .
but what about them ? what is it going to do with you ?
they sail in their operations across the sky and occasionally toss people to the experiments that their parents don &apos;t agree .
so we &apos;re interested in doing things like that .
now , the previous generations couldn &apos;t do these experiments .
and i found out that the first technology was <unk> million years ago in the form of <unk> .
we can learn a lot of them .
and i look at <unk> and i &apos;m trying to protect my child , because with such a kid , you don &apos;t tell anybody alone , even a minister of not a minister .
and second , they tell us that they had a <unk> gang , but some outward adaptations for the <unk> .
until now , our knowledge of our ancestors became the corresponding individuals , because the fossils , the <unk> , missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the origins of mankind in the vast ethiopia . he talks about how he &apos;s the oldest skeleton of a single child , and what we can learn from the most of us in africa .
and if all of the rules should be , you need to be able to have an effective system to the <unk> and the <unk> , because as we have discovered , it &apos;s also trust in everything .
it &apos;s been looking at as high seas because the continent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
we have to work locally , but also all the <unk> .
we have to create a new paradigm of being <unk> and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay numbers to do what i do . &quot;
so that was a pretty good idea .
so , to say , i &apos;m a journalist , not technologist , so i want to be a sketch , like the present and the future .
and finally , i think , we have to think about whether we want to be our reality -- and if , what it is for our ideas and everything that comes next .
it looks like oil oil .
the symptoms of the complex is that you have the strong and informed opinion , the right answer , no matter how difficult is the problem .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times , and to explain how it works .
we can do this .
and making a lot of money .
it &apos;s for example higher than the americans americans .
we &apos;re probably going to try . probably all of it .
<unk> immediately . &quot;
<unk> was trying to do it , but he couldn &apos;t prove the guess .
i &apos;m saying that our attitude is simply not sustainable .
china wants to have achieved in 20 years .
we &apos;re not even slow down .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yes , it &apos;s going to be ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to be in our lifetime -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that &apos;s coming .
and here &apos;s where you come in .
and what we need to think about is this : if you &apos;re going to go into your flames , what comes next ?
and we thought we can make these debt on our children , but imagine you &apos;re going to imagine that we can do this .
everything else is <unk> .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what the stage of the development is the cell .
it &apos;s not going to be amazing about it ?
all we get is <unk> .
you &apos;ll be able to be able to focus your listening , perhaps the aging can be able to do a number of things that we cannot do .
it &apos;s not a thousand years in the distance .
we should ban those cheap , simple <unk> , and nobody for their kids . &quot;
and here we can see this average .
we cannot be risking that the trust of the customer .
he only got 500 to get 500 to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge jar of <unk> , full of <unk> , they got , and he said , &quot; come back a week when they &apos;re still sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the way of the web -- the things we &apos;re talking about -- is <unk> a little bit less than 5,000 days .
of course , it &apos;s been the internet since about 5,000 days -- the web only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine we &apos;re now is a <unk> system , a human brain , if we look at the rate , it &apos;s going to be six billion more .
now it &apos;s not that -- if you &apos;re a table and things in the work , a word document , you &apos;re not part of the web , but it &apos;ll be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people are going to be the broader sense of the machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want to be <unk> .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea we &apos;re going to be .
three , it &apos;s going to be more ubiquitous , it &apos;s going to be our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i felt that the second <unk> of jesus christ was the sun was sun was <unk> moon , and i was prepared to be prepared by god &apos;s <unk> and prepared to be prepared to be the <unk> .
these are the dead of <unk> .
and it allows everything . it &apos;s all logical logical .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , how we line things .
this is a project that we just completed in <unk> for a huge amount of <unk> , which is the result of this process , it &apos;s the result of a number of forces that are developing .
and this led directly to another project .
it &apos;s actually a wrong attitude because the lack is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are doing to the education of young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
everybody from them to be aware of his neighbors .
so , as we have to pay for school fees .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can change our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a brain system .
this is very , very important , because there &apos;s a <unk> .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , flavor and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , one time , we all have animals like animals and then no longer . &quot;
these are men and women who even can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be

i &apos;m looking inside , you fit in a hundred years , and it can go back without a push in the earth .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you want to apply it all over the world , and you don &apos;t have to take care of <unk> or <unk> , because you have a lot of alternatives .
first , they catch atoms in a particular bottle .
i &apos;ve got a competition called &quot; dance your <unk> . &quot;
my country is in the way of 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s a lot of <unk> than all the speakers in front of me and all the ones that come to me .

the other half of the audience may not be <unk> -- from deep , cultural reasons , they think it &apos;s boring -- and finding a different pattern of a lot more interesting .
you can think about it in two ways .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of a head and a number .
and back to the most of the most profound <unk> , because of people are busy .
and only one percent of it .
he <unk> , &quot; i suppose that &apos;s a sudden death in a family , the likelihood for another one . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet pretty unlikely .
the whole control quality of the <unk> effects on industrial processing , it &apos;s the ability to do it by statistics .
the <unk> , maybe hundreds of life has saved hundreds of lives , the world .
a intelligent power force is prevented because of power is , until a intelligent <unk> is recognized .
yet , on the other hand , china is a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
you have facebook , we have <unk> .
yet , the <unk> itself can create a very strong force , which is never in the history of china .
so , chinese view of this <unk> is as real medium , not just as mere headlines .
how a great ted , not ?
so in the last three years , <unk> <unk> , in the last three years , <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re more transparent because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
and the chinese , free of the free of freedom and human rights as their <unk> , rather than a from america .

you cannot be able to say , &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in the two .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there is actually a theoretical argument for why technology is developed in <unk> .
now , evolution of our species had hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution used to basically generate the technology to the next stage , which was the first stage in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world , so we can make the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of the growth in the <unk> per year .
another big revolution is the <unk> .
so , to the exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars in computing is equivalent to the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to get the full of of these trends , and they have to be able to figure out how often the turbulence in the form of technology -- faster and faster , if we get to that point .
you can blessing and <unk> with yourself .
they &apos;re harder .
they were from the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , it &apos;s not something here .

thank you .
<unk> argument that it makes fun to fall in those big adventure , not quite the way i think of my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother &apos;s next year , a <unk> in antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation of the message that vc is to convince you that you are entrepreneurs , where you invest and make a lot of money with it .
and the way to do a company , to create a company or something -- that doesn &apos;t have to be company .
there are no <unk> of <unk> , which is no trouble in which there are no trouble .
from there they are taking them with -- on an solid , a reasonable path , the top of the end .
if i know somebody who &apos;s been doing this device .

statistically , one of them have a beetle .
if you imitate something , you might have a effect on it .
and if you have enough , you can click on a further link , you click on another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the chart , on the last place than the culture that doesn &apos;t make innovation .
as we think and behave , our <unk> is broken .
we have a <unk> memes -- seriously .
but forgive me , the problems are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the biggest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very <unk> .
we think we think is backwards .
through a change change , change , as transparency , for example , how to use <unk> , and collaboration cooperation , and not <unk> , those things are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are always made , the only way to us to get rid of the old <unk> , and new solutions to the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play , we can turn to to a little better .
it &apos;s for <unk> , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my masters took me with the <unk> , because the <unk> was the <unk> .
so , after i had a gesture of a gesture of the <unk> , they were very -- i was accepted and i worked on it for about six months .
nine days ago i had a fire .
you know -- all of stuff .
my kids , <unk> and henry .
we <unk> a lot of magazines , we did our homework , but what we looked like , we were surrounded by images like this .
this image literally formed in seconds after my baby was going to be in the arms , and i got it over .
rg : oh , oh .
av : taboo number three : don &apos;t talk about their opinion -- but i &apos;m going to talk today about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become more important than i &apos;ve been at the wonders of birth and family .
but you realize that you can imagine that you can get to the control of the wonderful way , which is what we think , our lives , there &apos;s a lot of meaning and what &apos;s profoundly satisfying .
rg + <unk> : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a episode of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we all have seen this &quot; star <unk> &quot; with the <unk> .
imagine being able to hear , big , already , late <unk> <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , to be able to be able to play in the way you would play personally . john <unk> walker shows how footage can be analyzed to the <unk> and <unk> , and then analyze them on <unk> wings .
now , since we &apos;ve been experienced a time of extraordinary economic development , the longest parliament in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , as good people are always going to be in the <unk> apple without to bite the mine , &quot; how someone did , they can &apos;t hide .
now , i didn &apos;t really understand it until i met this guy , a <unk> , slightly chaotic man who <unk> off <unk> and iron for completely <unk> .
but interestingly , it &apos;s also a future where society is a few of the capitalism of capitalism , which is how you &apos;re using the dna of the <unk> innovation in society by trying to do things , and then those who work and <unk> .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis and some surprising new insights , which i &apos;ve been working on the relationship between the structure of language that you &apos;re talking about , and their ambition to save .
and if i want to talk right , force is <unk> me to think about it .
well , this is a <unk> theory .
squeeze this device , you can actually hold this device , you can actually measure your <unk> hand , so i can measure your <unk> .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate across generations .
we have a ph.d. they &apos;re constantly losing them .
but i &apos;m about it as a maid .
but they didn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
at the same time i was on the field of the <unk> , although i was a ph.d. in <unk> .
people and <unk> and the birds and the birds , and everything that &apos;s the red line . these are human beings , livestock and pets .
we focused on the future of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this was the last night at the party , and -- you can see how it just <unk> , and you can see any <unk> that you want .
and he was a dissatisfied about how people the buddhist religion in india has been practiced in india .
and he goes back to the village .
and he has to close your eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the <unk> and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re from . we take a sense of memory of a mother and large , and we &apos;re all living in this meditation .
and you think of how do things are , if they &apos;re happy when they &apos;re happy .
and of course they &apos;re cruel and <unk> toward others .
although the change in your attitude is something for other things , and they feel that new quality in you , and it &apos;s also helping you and it &apos;s also to give you a role model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of a sudden , one of the society used to get tools to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very simple if you know how to read it .
okay , let me close with four <unk> <unk> , an example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to keep it with detail , but in the lower right-hand corner , you can see an example of what we have .
do you start doing this ?
and then , from that , the <unk> of the things , what the <unk> has been talking about what our new type of organization is , or better , how do we organize ourselves ourselves ?
the inventor of things are going to be less in the situation , it &apos;s just going to be in the use of the , in collaboration with the <unk> .
suppose we assume that astronomy has mentioned yochai mentioned .
it &apos;s also <unk> , professional argument .
so there &apos;s no argument of two atoms , but between those camps , there are all kinds of interesting positions that are going to be taken from people .
that costs costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to pursue their <unk> and actually , a team , it was done , and the spain and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for it .
but the truth is , that life is right here .
so people people have , and they have news like this one .
he said , &quot; i am like batman to the dismay of my anonymity . &quot;
and the one that didn &apos;t have a data , so that turned out she was just moved into a different town and a new job .
and in recent years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , from gene over the neurotransmitter , dopamine and things , to the <unk> .
some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on the gender .
this was one of those cases , because in their own , there was no violence under their ancestors , but my dad had already been .
they &apos;re kind of like a similar way to be able to be .
by the way , i have an email today that is that we &apos;ve finished the last part of the atlas .
and these guys are the weak force that may be familiar most familiar .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue , or why atomic nuclei , they should basically be able to make a <unk> computer -- why dna has the shape that you have once -- -- it has a little bit of a time --
the comparison is that the people in this room represent higgs higgs particles .
but it &apos;s really so that with this theory of the physical <unk> , the the <unk> of the big bang , a absolutely wonderful prediction , and the model didn &apos;t have to do that , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this wonderful image that turned the darkness into light and it allows it to see the civilization from all of the .
another big insight came from a study of the rwandan state at 2010 , the baseball maps of the <unk> maps of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
in a similar trial , in germany , researchers use fmri <unk> to measure <unk> , and after they had <unk> <unk> , they had had to suppress the smile .
&quot; because the colors that they order to have to have to do not the european standard , and he said .
&quot; safer ? why ? were there getting more policemen ? &quot;
we built the light that people people who were people from <unk> , to think they were abroad , if they were to <unk> their concerns .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something , and you &apos;ve done it already . &quot;
all around in port-au-prince came entrepreneurs and offering for the <unk> for mobile .
one of an illustration of the <unk> power of technology is in kibera .
by 2015 , there will be three billion of your own world .
in the shops of the environment , the batteries and bread .
this flow of time is embedded in everything in the <unk> of a <unk> , in the <unk> , the <unk> of rose .
do you read an interview with a writer ?
and also , if i look at the big bear , i remember how i &apos;m going to be a kid in his head , not to slide from his shoulders , and i &apos;m feeling again like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen again how creative technology can be and our our lives , we can choose those solutions to innovations and moments , the flow of the time , but again .
my mom was <unk> .
in every single refugee camp , they had to <unk> soldiers who were nine to the older brother , and i wanted to make a child child child .
and i should do it alone .
take something you want to have , from the suitcase .
then i ended up in <unk> , because i didn &apos;t feel my feelings .
thank you .
so almost everything on earth is going to be wiped out about five times .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why should it play a role ?
so , in theory , we can grow any organ in any cell in any cell .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
so if the <unk> goes down with the same speed , the robot .
and you can see how resilient is the control .
and he does this , as he put it out of the air .
they take their neighbors .
this is showing that we can double the <unk> , triple , as we can , where we can get them to build teams , as you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where he wants to go .
i can understand that . but there &apos;s so many , and i want to expand your trajectory , the awareness open and your perspective on honeybees .
it has been a huge problem for many years , essentially since the last of the <unk> , the many different viruses , bacteria and <unk> .
they don &apos;t experience that .
so they take the chefs for their recipes , and the honey -- they &apos;re using the honey to your bars .
the bee dies . honeybees are going to die if you stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , now , does that mean ?
of course , we have , especially in the last decade , the world with a dense chain of <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before , many people weren &apos;t aware of this fact .
in fact , not many of you don &apos;t know that our bread was not in the way .
and particularly the meat meat in <unk> and china drives the <unk> .
<unk> has been , and here are not a lot of farmers among them to be bad , to be bad , to be the environment to the environment , to the environment , the environment .
all of it is together .
and so , as i &apos;m doing my bread -- and i got it <unk> , and i &apos;m trying to burn it .
it &apos;s also to keep the long time of the country , with the available tools , materials and <unk> .
you take someone like me , and i &apos;m analyzed a scientist , analyzed and test and and i have a new technology , and the anthropic <unk> .
because i hope you &apos;re going to take this today from here , a new connection with nature .
this was a few days ago .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is the last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them . and shekhar kapur , a film about her , <unk> queen , you should see .
but i think the most important thing is we can do it .
but this is actually <unk> as a fit .
this is a <unk> patient who was in the time -- he needed to get a bypass , but it was to be a <unk> .
i like this slide because you can tell you about what people really motivated to change , and what doesn &apos;t .
if you eat a meal meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . american food even , because ever , and even more , even more , and even more , and even more , more , , but the actual number higher , the the is the case , so the the is the case to reduce both .
one of the most promising research studies found out that 70 percent of people were clogged , the average of people had bad breath , 54 percent had had headaches -- that &apos;s not healthy diet .
on the other hand , everything is all intimacy , <unk> .
i hope he &apos;s not going to hang .
the film is based on an <unk> of f.
two <unk> were involved in the project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to do the most of the most important and technology .
so we <unk> ourselves from motion capture .
the number seemed to be infinite .
and that &apos;s the data that we get from this , and then we &apos;re used for the model .
and this is what the finished picture was used in the film .
this was a very , very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the middle of the state .
and it has a <unk> .
people are going to transcend this cruel , <unk> past , where they lived their lives .
we were to <unk> -- two of them as a driver -- and imagine , this vast is a sea of sand , 40 degrees fahrenheit , a water bottle .
i think this camel is the best animal animal in the world . &quot;
and they &apos;re using it as much as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;m going to show you another film .
i don &apos;t <unk> until my body temperature , 40 degrees fahrenheit -- enough to be an egg .
<unk> , thank you for inviting me .
start a a poem . that would be an idea .
but how would you like to do if they never knew how they would be the next day , how do you live the next day , whether you &apos;re a living god , their shoulders in the clouds , or you &apos;re sitting down there with your little <unk> ?
who could sleep at this night ?
but knew that judy <unk> in your age 150,000 dollars per film that <unk> d is the french army led to defeat the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> pascal had cleaned his room -- no wait , i mean he invented the calculator calculator ?
at the end , they were sitting in a tree and a <unk> hand in the other .
and the human <unk> is more than that , but if you remove those two column , probably not have much left .
we also have the problem that you cannot build construction , which is to be a single case for an individual .
one of them is understanding . here &apos;s a <unk> , &quot; the ability to understand the emotions of the other . &quot;
now we &apos;re now more complex terms . here &apos;s consolation .
it &apos;s not good for them , it &apos;s out .
there &apos;s a very simple job that you have to do .
a philosopher told us that it was impossible that one of the sense of fairness would have invented a sense of fairness , because in the french revolution .
now , it &apos;s not a lonely insane , it &apos;s not two kooks , three is a lot of power , a lot of power .
the last decade i &apos;ve been studying it pain and <unk> , hopefully for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i must say , thank god .
so i heard in , in a way , it was a success .
over the years , the most important economic system can create .
a.j. jacobs : how much of the healthy life kills me almost kills me .
and i think that many of the <unk> of the perspective are sharing .
so , a really cool thing .
now , these studies have been valid scientific , and they &apos;re <unk> , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask for the part of the story that doesn &apos;t tell you .
... a priest ?
finally , one group , the people who thinks that the indus people are the ancestors of the people in the most of the world &apos;s disease .
on the left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful to produce more data , which are then <unk> .
this is the most common one of the indus script , and just in this text appears to be twice .
it turns out that in india , it &apos;s been a long tradition to give the point of <unk> at the basis of the birth of <unk> .
space , we all know what it looks like .
this wire is <unk> the <unk> , the name bell famous .

actually , the young people of the city .
somebody who sit in front of you -- that &apos;s okay , in a <unk> , , but you would sit on a <unk> , and somebody would sit up beside you , then they would <unk> .
the dalai lama always says -- he says , if you &apos;re in the spirit of the <unk> of the <unk> , it &apos;s because you realize that you and your pain and joy finally to become a little playground for the intelligence .
so , take this wonderful thing that <unk> showed us , and they blew us a fear of the <unk> .
a man front of a tank was a a picture that was a symbol of the <unk> .
but what if they could not do anything , if they had the modern communications , to make a sense that the wrong thing to go back , right ?
combine it to combine the power of a global ethic that &apos;s power to communicate on global level and global globally , and globally , to organize globally , and the most largely global nature is .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there is a photograph of a <unk> boys -- and the museum of the children &apos;s life , which were left when in the course of the country of rwanda , a million people have died .

they can move on very different <unk> -- they vary in the <unk> , the movement of the surface and the the .
this is a <unk> of the <unk> algae .
boy : <unk> .
slow down to see the spikes in action .
mark cutkosky at stanford , one of my partner is an extraordinary engineer , which created a technology called <unk> deposition manufacturing , where he actually can put into a synthetic foot .
they &apos;re almost like the <unk> of the <unk> , and the secret what it is to stick , your <unk> toes .
so here we &apos;re going to pull the down .
these <unk> structures are allowing it to spines , <unk> and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , difficult surfaces .
so , <unk> long beautiful , the <unk> of beautiful texts that serve as <unk> and males and give a mate and choose to choose a mate .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet apart , they have to be less than half of the time of the <unk> .
if we think about the <unk> of animals as the dolphins , we have to be aware of the consequences of our interventions that we thought of a rather clever thing .
after the <unk> , the marine <unk> has made these systems to learn what scientists could hear .
they &apos;re only hearing the low frequencies .
if males and females and females are using this signal to find a mate , and they &apos;re scattered , imagine what the implications of the species of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population .
as ships can be made of <unk> , they found that with a better <unk> noise of this noise , to 90 percent of this noise .
it &apos;s about 50 percent .
we see foreign worlds , we see foreign <unk> , 300 , and it &apos;s getting more , and they &apos;re not like we .
you have all kinds of possibilities .
we &apos;re going to see a continuous rise in the men .
and obviously there is one , the hundred .
with initiatives like the $ 100 laptop , and it &apos;s the idea of that we can bring a whole new generation of people into the old <unk> computer .
thank you .
i think there &apos;s no problem of this problem .
our daily lives are , but <unk> , in an extraordinary condition , we &apos;re going to say in a <unk> .
it &apos;s usually one or two per year .
and there are you !
but we &apos;re a lot of more .
part of the challenge was to try and to <unk> the rhythm and space by not just my hands -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet of my body and the balls to my feet .
and then you play crazy .
ok , because you all don &apos;t understand what a <unk> is , i give you a little hint .
now , again , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have the top of someone who &apos;s the most popular principle is this whole life , ok ?
<unk> -- and then it &apos;s quiet . just a little bit of a number of time .
with space and straight in the other way .
and then <unk> levels .
in this year -- could you show the slides -- in this year , we &apos;re going to do the <unk> of the <unk> of the design that we have helped develop the <unk> in the design .
we can actually call this one of the <unk> , and we can put it on the clothes that you &apos;re doing this .
scott adams : i realized that i &apos;m the way to be the foremost expert in the <unk> .
and we &apos;re also known as a new product as well . it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s been shown in public .
currently , the farmers can only in the rainy season , not in the <unk> harvest .
electrons are disappearing in a way of <unk> and then it &apos;s still energy , and energy can &apos;t see .
this is what he thought he was there .
potatoes , potatoes have <unk> chromosomes . did you know this ?
all right . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what is the point of , henry ?
we have been <unk> about four years .
if google is , you get it in a very nice building .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the 1940s , everybody would be excited .
but imagine , it &apos;s not going to be interested in .
but also , many of the right , which is very clear about propaganda .
if you &apos;re going to get your <unk> , it means &quot; <unk> &quot; with a a.
if i walk this pink sound for longer than a few minutes , they would literally stop hearing it .
so many people get to <unk> , but this is rapidly big , public spaces like this , shared <unk> , in millions of tiny , tiny little personal <unk> .
you can also do this in a beautiful place like a sea .
and finally an acronym , for the end .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you so much for you . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and so they went away .
because they weren &apos;t on the pavement and couldn &apos;t see the exchange that between me and my <unk> , a exchange that &apos;s fair to us , but strangers seemed that .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you , in the last year , there was a lot of competition , because the arab spring remains still in the <unk> ... what ?
this photograph actually was put on a police station and on the ground , they see the <unk> of the people who were being persecuted by the police .
the kids do just pictures in a class , the teacher , they &apos;re tuned them on the <unk> .
in the talk , it &apos;s about the brain and , and you know , there &apos;s a <unk> in the outside .
so that &apos;s something that we can work in our lifetime , and i thought i can make a difference in the <unk> , and i was trying to get out of the <unk> to come into the <unk> .
but sometimes science has some of the other characteristics that they really really interesting .
what do we get there more data ?
there &apos;s something that we think it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t think of the alligator as very intelligent , not in a human species .
in humans , we &apos;ve developed the most part of the neocortex , the <unk> part of the neocortex . nature has this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you look at it and say , &quot; what are i seeing ?
not like a <unk> . it &apos;s not a <unk> .
those are the things that are going to come first .
we need a little bit of a police , we need a military military , but only to the .
you can see it on your office . &quot;
she travels because she was the time of elections in the elections of the country .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then when she closed the door , she said , &quot; no , no , no .
they &apos;re so much in hand .
this group uses three , everybody one .
it &apos;s real .
she has done it from learning english and learn this as a foreign language .
the computer already , and in one of three people , in one of three cases .
if you think , you think differently than the companies of the united states , which is actually part of our <unk> , because that &apos;s what we did .
we repeated the same experiment with the same groups , but a delay of the enlightenment , how we handle the data , and the actual onset of the <unk> .
the price of this is the displacement of paradise .
and they moved and rubbing each other and they had their arms to each other and <unk> .
we &apos;re really good at talking about capabilities and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you ask your own coach , the <unk> of the <unk> for the lean down .
i don &apos;t feel like emotion with emotion .
the first one , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to peer into the people of other people and figure out what they offer .
they have <unk> humility .
that &apos;s what the unconscious call the unconscious .
we found them between <unk> , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey ?
and it &apos;s not normal , in a home home .
so what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : the way of dictionaries .
well , first of all , i &apos;m going to blame the queen because it &apos;s funny .
dictionaries have to be different .
the bad words -- look at if someone thinks a place , and then it doesn &apos;t happen on the map , he thinks , &quot; this card is ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think that words are tools we use to give our our mind , how do you know that homosexuality are better than hammer ?
the <unk> has 33 different <unk> of the <unk> .
and then this mike <unk> . mike <unk> lives in britain .
i have the whole time of the the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary .
so , i &apos;m a chair .
and to make a long story short , i &apos;ve got up here .
and so , piece of play , during this three days , you start by understanding , why do i hear all this stuff stuff ?
you may be from a ted speaker , and we can come back the conversation during the year and next year , and next year , and next year , after the same intellectuals and emotional journey .
the producers didn &apos;t have the <unk> in their cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not sure what the public is going to be so precise to the public with such as precise <unk> , which actually might fold on the hand .
there you were afraid whether that was already <unk> , and it was technically not able to find the place .
instead of the <unk> of the <unk> , you &apos;re doing it .
and , &quot; you can trust . &quot;
we call us <unk> &amp; amp ; we and we &apos;re living in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a <unk> man .
we debate the case of what the world needs now is nuclear , &quot; right ?
and yet , there &apos;s only three <unk> of it -- coal and gas , <unk> , which is almost all the way you &apos;re all the , -- and nuclear power .
we &apos;ve become the russian warheads , by using electricity .
<unk> emissions are equivalent equivalent of all greenhouse gases and particles that causes the warming , and to co2 .
now , if you think of the fact that the spread of nuclear weapons is because we &apos;ve been able to know that india and pakistan <unk> nuclear weapons in <unk> .
it &apos;s the area of the bigger , but the <unk> is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- only one or two voices are necessary to the global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough of the sources of renewable sources .
i used to worry about the 10,000 years ago .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was assassinated by apollo .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some of a few people , and the available technologies that we &apos;re going to allow us to use the exploring of the universe .
26 thousand groups were used to the competition , and there was a million dollars between one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can put it to the space station .
and the advantage of the great for the donors is the sum of the <unk> and social <unk> .
would you surprise us , you know , are the most interesting .
that means that distances itself can replicate themselves . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was , how we can express this new algorithmic order in a pillar .
what i didn &apos;t know at the time , because we only had the outside , was that the distances continued to go back to the surface of the , and it was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of division , michael <unk> algorithms , the incredible , fascinating forms of distances , no human being able to build it by hand , but you can build it . and you could build it .
so , look at this image here -- many forms of the shapes are dancing here for them .
it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip <unk> even the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led to young people .
and i think a lot of people here in the room , many of you are in the same position as i .
so i think that women are in our society , because they realize that it &apos;s very important for your future generations to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that has been given people to the way of youtube and social networks to give their stories to their stories , to show their stories and their stories with their own voices .
at the same time , we invite you to come to come here and we &apos;re going to explore our part of the world .
so i became less than less than &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do these ants a few apartments , you &apos;re going to be there . &quot;
this was called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back the next day .
and it went ...
my work , roughly , roughly , five , six , six , six weeks ; they can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i took it around , and formed the <unk> .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very <unk> job , but the best things come in little <unk> .
they expect to expect their employees , they asked them to have them , if they &apos;ve done the task , you can do more .
there is this absolute concentration of being , this absolute <unk> of consciousness , awareness , an absolute center of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of the divine .
my <unk> body flew in the direction , my <unk> wheel in the other .
i put all the <unk> of all the <unk> that i probably didn &apos;t do with you , the <unk> , i didn &apos;t have a <unk> , the friends i don &apos;t have any <unk> , the <unk> that i couldn &apos;t go with them .
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in the back of the , against the wind , you just get over and it power <unk> in the muck . &quot;
20 years ago , doctors would have been off my leg and hoped there was a 15 year-old .
as i got more and more human -- and at that point in my life , i was probably 14 pounds lighter than i &apos;m now .
and nobody does this modern <unk> in my eyes as a david black .
upright walk , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s the international unit of international <unk> for <unk> , which is the most popular name that i ever heard .
he was born and a half months to early and it was really a great <unk> of him .
so , as soon as i tried to get the piano , i became a strong <unk> .
and the end of the end , you were so quick , that things like the flight of &quot; flight &quot; no problem , right ?
do you want to hear me ?
dp : tiger <unk> .
i don &apos;t .
they struggle to be their own lives in this forest in a world that &apos;s even clean , a world which is not <unk> , in a world that &apos;s not being <unk> .
we know that they can be able to do the research for absolutely impossible than i started .
the long caring of caring for the mother who are <unk> during this long period , and also the one can still keep going to keep life , and that can be to be to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and the vast camp of the <unk> forest in the forest now need meat , and so the the pygmies that lived in the <unk> and there in their wonderful lives , and in their wonderful lives , for many hundreds of years .
yesterday , somebody said that .
now , there are now in every state , and the problems in florida are others than the new york .
do you know , and i &apos;m going to down here ?
there are the politicians in the politicians ?
what we want to do in the lab is pretty much the same , but with a few dozen of different kinds of molecules -- so a <unk> reduction of complexity , but yet trying to get a little bit more <unk> .
it &apos;s actually very <unk> . if they &apos;re forming , they actually don &apos;t actually do something .
now , where they &apos;re all the experts in protocells are we &apos;re playing with these protocells .
we then see the self-assembly of this body of the <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black <unk> represent this black mud -- these <unk> , very complex , organic black sludge .
in his lab , martin <unk> , &quot; protocells , &quot; the <unk> of chemicals that behave like living cells , and his work shows how life could be done on earth first -- and maybe elsewhere .
this is a <unk> to lead your tadpole on the evening .
what is this -- how did you know that ? they took it .
but if we did it with each fire fire , we could define the natural ones .
so that &apos;s the filth that &apos;s otherwise in their pretty pink lungs , and the associated with --
the birds could jump from one another .
you can <unk> the news of him . they can talk to him .
but those herd , i think , will be a big toll of our planet .
next to the skin skin cells , they multiply them in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working for thousands of years with the <unk> of the , including like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we make it all over the world of our research research , we see that it &apos;s almost a universal quest for people to have a car .
so let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge amount of energy to produce mobile energy .
if we can see this <unk> future , that &apos;s also other .
you had to survive .
and we would certainly be in our school district to be funding for funding and support .
because why should our students get so far away from your life ?
it became a book , then to a performance .
there was an incredible idea , a a insane idea .
here on the west coast , they destroyed their forest .
but on this picture , you see how we started building the <unk> , which is soon a big part of brazil .
when i came up with the time , my <unk> , i studied this new <unk> of the <unk> .
if you &apos;re in the south of the south , you see the expansion of new york city as it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the <unk> of the <unk> .
or the <unk> , the <unk> meadows , insects and <unk> places .
maybe there &apos;s been a <unk> .
it &apos;s so much force in it , science and visualizing that images are like this , and it &apos;s like both sides of the <unk> .
and we have a really dramatic level of our society currently .
so i don &apos;t have to get into this .
you &apos;re going to be the pristine , which is to remain .
this is a <unk> building .
so , an example we all know , is that the cell phone . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and <unk> way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of the that help us make it .
seriously , you clap -- that &apos;s really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future
you could think that this could be a huge problem for a law , but congress doesn &apos;t seem to be very much about it .
but if you build a lot of high-quality copies and sell copies , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we &apos;ve done this stuff that we &apos;ve found , and every single option caused to <unk> in those industry .
so that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very <unk> , <unk> , <unk> education in india , and that blew me nearly broken .
and i thought i start a barefoot college -- english only for the poor .
a professional is somebody , with a combination of competence and confidence and belief .
when i said that , they said , &quot; show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do . what do you do ?
the entire power comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , how to be the country , what you should do , if you &apos;re getting arrested , what you should do , if you have a animal is sick .
and there &apos;s too tension in the tension , the attendance is coming between teachers and parent , so you can call the <unk> and the parents and say , &quot; give you the hands .
you use language language language language .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , &quot; i can &apos;t president president .
a <unk> .
and our <unk> are creating one of the largest , dynamically <unk> computer in the world for this kind of <unk> .
you see the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data of those two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m going to be physical , financially , emotionally , mentally , mentally , and in almost any other way , &quot; i don &apos;t sleep .
he didn &apos;t embarrass him , and of course , ray <unk> six months later , the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because you &apos;re the experiment that i &apos;ve been used to talk to you , <unk> of <unk> images .
we collected our materials , went out of the room and wait for half an hour .
i &apos;ll show you why .
they were making two of the two images , and they had two beautiful <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> for them for the most important things and we said , &quot; what would you do ? &quot;
we take a whole new group of <unk> <unk> and say , &quot; you know , we give a <unk> , and we can do it in two different ways .
<unk> , the big car and the <unk> is beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh , shit .
&quot; mom , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this is that this tradition is not from the <unk> of <unk> , but goes back in a time before we were stories on <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the way of food , yeah .
the kind of thing that you know , the <unk> roof , you know .
and so we had my dad , i knew he would kill me , if i knew it alone , so we climb into the car .
&quot; and this guy had about a blue , and a <unk> expression in the face ? &quot;
i really want to put in it ? because if i didn &apos;t thread , i don &apos;t thread , to me , enough metaphors for your taste ? -- could it be that i never come back .
see ? we &apos;re a secret club to a secret <unk> .
she says , &quot; mama , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little old lady , damn time ! &quot;
it &apos;s up to the car . &quot;
i &apos;m really big fear .
so what is the social result of this ?
where can i go today and who are ?
and if we have it , we &apos;ll decide how many miles we drive , where <unk> , where we live and work .
so intelligent terminal at the center station , and you see exactly where your bus is on the road and when he comes , and you can buy your purchases in real time .
i want to be the wireless <unk> of the right , and i challenge that this network is to be open standards for everybody .
and they came in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who have a mental illness in touch , knowledge , what a challenge of it can be .
i said that i wanted to tell the <unk> , i wanted to leave with you the three a , and i wanted to leave you with a <unk> .
because they all had three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier is just a genuine person , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the authenticity .
i ate <unk> with <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in the clean sleep .
j so many , that this is the problem of being a problem .
i found it weird about it as if it was a competition , and it was a <unk> wound .
it &apos;s a <unk> of a white , rich <unk> , that &apos;s not the <unk> .
it looks pretty simple , but this was a <unk> .
people are about two things -- they were very concerned about the destruction , but there was also a sense of the <unk> of the new yorker that i thought very much .
because at the end of the four platforms -- with a greater version of a <unk> -- we knew it had to be able to be able to be able to get to be able to get to be able to get to <unk> , and the way of ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was me an honor .
and i know that kids are concussion every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here , and a concussion , , most of us would completely <unk> in a time of several hours to a few weeks .
you have to know about the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turned out , tom looked at a one that a helmet was a good option for the <unk> to keep a 100,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s not true , but tony blair got in 2005 when his <unk> , of course , when his <unk> , of course , &quot; and he described as the way .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that &apos;s in the sequence of a sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are committed to offer patents to pharmaceuticals at least 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the companies to <unk> their patents and make them available for other .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a <unk> , and people were sitting in the <unk> sun , the afternoon , in very high , and they felt not comfortable .
they can adapt to your well-being .
he offers all of those services , <unk> , <unk> , and so little things you &apos;re going to do for a moment , but for people who he &apos;s connecting to the digital world .
and the question was , how do you take from this teacher .
let &apos;s see what he does .
and the husband of the daughter , he was also sick by the exhaustion of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very large .
well , <unk> had a <unk> of our studies .
now , if we feel emotion , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people have a different structural position within the network .
this is my <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re both of carbon , and yet one of them are <unk> in a particular way , on the left , and they get <unk> , the soft and dark .
so to make this something to the , let me zoom down for a moment .
they &apos;re not easy to get older .
among the same circumstances , older people are their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more positive information than in negative information than negative information than negative information than negative .
we cost life .
they &apos;d let me wish : &quot; tonight , i &apos;m going to perform this <unk> for this girl on this bar . &quot;
she &apos;s like , i &apos;m honestly saying , honestly , often , i don &apos;t know exactly what happens when i dance .
they have me and uncles and then , and i &apos;ve been calling myself over five years of five years .
<unk> : the second fort laramie fort laramie is the state of the large sioux nation and the <unk> of the lakota over the sacred black hills .
the fort laramie fort laramie , that at least three quarter of the <unk> had to sign a sign to the land .
they were tired of contracts .
the <unk> is eight times as high as the average of america .
so what are us going to do ?
and today ? child mortality rate since 1960 has been six percent of the average six percent .
you get it either as a pill or a syringe , you know , you have to take it every day to regulate the <unk> .
if we are , like here , we have to do with people ...
but basically , it makes a lot of sense .
it &apos;s : are you smarter than a <unk> ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is , this car looks safe .
now you &apos;re thinking , &quot; if my life depends on it , i would use it every day . &quot;
we have to connect this with a scientific approach .
this is something else being an effective campaign to do .
what is not a new .
the lamps are going to be darker .
we do it for our customer .
we have the ones in the sun .
now , logic -- logical , , logical , , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , from this position to the right there -- without the wrist .
i &apos;m going to intervene now . now , if any one -- a different person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some <unk> .
here , i have to look at from the beginning to take my maps during the <unk> of the <unk> -- oh , we should start with -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what the card is i use ? the lady or the five ?
lg : but you see the hand .
wait for moment -- take any card .
one of the color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yes ? zoe : yeah .
here -- all the maps -- here -- all the cards -- right ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly ... five seconds .
some of you seem to know this kid .
so , after i went back , i was doing my whole company to a <unk> . &quot;
if you didn &apos;t hear a song , you couldn &apos;t go off your car .
so let &apos;s see what this is happening .
i &apos;m always saying to my students , &quot; if you have a fallacy , you can see a <unk> , , then it detects everybody . &quot;
imagine the person before and follow it , the whole journey of b to e , and you &apos;ll hear anything that would say .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 , was a conductor for 20 years , and suddenly a realization .
she came to auschwitz when she was 15 years old . her brother was eight , her parents lost her parents .
so , ladies and gentlemen , look out of the jury here .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , they get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for the 21st century , this <unk> , <unk> doesn &apos;t work -- doesn &apos;t work , often , and often often .
think of your own work .
the standard of living is lower .
these are the building blocks of a completely new <unk> of our businesses .
this one day intense autonomy has led to a whole range of <unk> that might never have been given .
do it because you like to do it .
the aluminum is used for its light weight .
in a series of <unk> , <unk> spheres is it proportional to the <unk> and its distances , to the little earth .
and the blue side , the <unk> , shows in the direction .
this has developed with a lot of <unk> .
the <unk> of the object would probably be a very large picture of the earth .
but it keeps going to keep those 10 percent or more back , which is most of the most primitive or <unk> .
<unk> dollars and a a group of <unk> dollars and a group of <unk> dollars .
charitable organizations have to be able to be able to get us , courageous , large , , new <unk> , <unk> , by fear , that they &apos;re going to get their reputation through the mud .
so what should you do ?
the average , they have the overhead .
dan <unk> : our thinking about charity is <unk> .
then there were the <unk> of the listener , yes , that was the way of the music to the music .
people who have made these <unk> , the <unk> , all these beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about the least of the music as it is written , not about interpretation . &quot;
so that &apos;s great . and what is your eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .
you know , the authority is available to the , if it needed to be , it &apos;s very important .
so in the kleiber , it &apos;s about the process .
as a <unk> , we tell ourselves a lot of stories about the future and about how we might do that .
there are <unk> <unk> world .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that makes a really fun .
you think about whether they should go forward to it .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we don &apos;t have to transition , we have to make this whole community for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced . and to some extent , they &apos;re the games that they play to be able to make this , so that you can &apos;t see what the most are are relatively simple challenges .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really , four states that this big challenge is not standing towards the .
and even if they just could do that , they could give it to the <unk> .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a <unk> when i visited <unk> <unk> , and i was in a <unk> of my life , and i was trying to decide to decide to the music of music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered clocks , a young lady , i knew that sex may be so good for the five senses .
the <unk> has a good senses for the five senses in an extreme level .
of course , the five senses aren &apos;t the only thing that life is going to be interesting .
we &apos;re all born as an artist .
if you have that a conversation , the one needs to come up with the next answer to the <unk> of what it started .
but your parents tell you , &quot; it will all pull off the waves . &quot;
but kids are normally doing art for fun . it &apos;s playing .
but you &apos;re rarely find a teacher .
in <unk> , people are always people who are &quot; <unk> &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; hotel california &quot; while they &apos;re imitating <unk> .
right in that minute , we can turn off the television set . they &apos;re out of the internet , stand on the internet , they &apos;re on and start to do something .
the students fall in a kind of trance .
he said it was profile . &quot; and what are you ? &quot; i said , &quot; actor , &quot; he said .
let &apos;s start by the point i came to this point .
it will be more powerful and more flooding .
if you , it will be a warming in the future .
but the delay is the the delay .
the economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
a large part of the species will be threatened by extinction .
now , if now , if now , if now , it &apos;s a matter of accident , it &apos;s important that we &apos;re not only going to save the stunt stunt , but the crew .
so , for something else , they &apos;ve been used to use , once , once , it was all the thing you had .
but today we use a <unk> .
it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> .
in 1960 , joseph <unk> from the united states force was done something very incredible .
one of the trouble at this altitude , if you go to 10,000 feet -- that &apos;s great , right ? if you &apos;re in 10,000 <unk> , you can actually use oxygen .
and they made a puppet in a puppet , and he looked like this .

there were three <unk> -- not true ? -- that the conference is important for what i want to talk about .
and the girl said , &quot; you know , you know . &quot;
the problem is an artist to be growing up as you &apos;re growing up , and i &apos;m convinced that we don &apos;t grow in the creativity in the creativity , or we &apos;re going to be more .
all over the world .
the whole system was invented -- all over the world , there was no public education system before the 19th century .
the brain isn &apos;t divide in areas .
they made her ballet , they made <unk> and jazz , they danced in modern and contemporary dances .
the festival goes to how much of the <unk> press for you would die for .

dubai is like a hand that wants to put the things of the things that you want .
before i want to finish in the middle east , i want to close to a <unk> of the largest <unk> .
it &apos;s also the <unk> .
well , beautiful . they &apos;re dysfunction , and they are dysfunction .
we don &apos;t have all facts . we don &apos;t even know what the tools be that or what we &apos;re going to be in the unique to be able to get to get to go to that way .
how are you going to expand it ? &quot;
the three are all the same , although they &apos;re all the same in many different parts of the , one is magical , the other , how do i like to do this books because they have something very special about themselves .
the kids have taught them .
they were very friendly .
we also think that the content is important .
i became changed through my kids .
howard does this experiment and when he gets the data , he builds a curve , and suddenly he realizes that doesn &apos;t make a nice <unk> .
this was his <unk> . he was obsessed with it .
howard don &apos;t believe that there are this .
people always tell them , if you ask them , how do you wish your coffee .
a mustard with more elegance and culture and meaning .
so it was it . why did you like that ?
he was <unk> , and spent most of his career in the lower , and ended up in management management , and then ended up the general manager of &quot; oakland a &quot; .
we all know what happened when millions of women were over for the symptoms of symptoms for symptoms of a large trial , <unk> by the national trial , which is found out of the national .
thank you .
but dad <unk> <unk> and he didn &apos;t want to do this .
but there &apos;s also a gray between between .
these are four really different ways to see the world . i named it .
what &apos;s interesting is , as you &apos;re <unk> -- and -- by the way -- that &apos;s from <unk> -- -- showing all the artifacts of modern comic , : <unk> <unk> simple line line , and a <unk> from left to the right .
and that was what i proposed : we might be making comics on an infinite canvas : on the <unk> and the the line and the <unk> .
this is daniel <unk> in britain .
maybe you &apos;ve been able to get it for granted , but for me , i often saw this very difficult day , i had never seen this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
this is honestly and genuine , and the reason why <unk> demonstrates such a sustainable impression of <unk> .
if you believe your baby &apos;s gay , or gay , you should be able to get it to the adoption .
<unk> political solution was to be the second-class citizens of texas , for the rain .
this song is called &quot; <unk> <unk> the sun .
i want to start with something like this evening , because i want to ask you to leave the mainland , and just to go down to the open to the open .
they were coming to the end of the , and the <unk> of the , six million years ago , when whales had legs , they were <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , they allow me to give me this <unk> <unk> .
and how do you do that ?
the <unk> <unk> takes the molas when they come into the bay , and it turns them into a kind of <unk> , and then throws them around .
i &apos;ll show you our last data set .
in fact , most exciting that all their love and her interest for the oceans .
as you can see here , this is a <unk> <unk> .
you don &apos;t hear a day .
<unk> <unk> .
in australia , it &apos;s mostly the <unk> who are in jail .
she told him , and he <unk> the first <unk> of what we call the <unk> .
because no one can get a <unk> .
so why don &apos;t we do something about this problem in the everyday life ?
goodbye : mahatma gandhi .
could i get my last note ?
never , that &apos;s impossible ! no , no ! that &apos;s not possible . &quot;
you could cope with the whole thing that you could .
von neumann , a <unk> and a mathematician , and a mathematician , they took everything together , and then they needed a room to build them .
and the <unk> and output worked on the first one .
&quot; aha ! &quot; finally , they found out that it was a <unk> .
i know if i have to give me . &quot;
he would put the machine all night , if someone at a stephen wolfram reminds that the whole thing was .
now we &apos;re going to sit here 50 years later -- it &apos;s a way of force to this force .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes i &apos;m talking here , four americans who are now alive , die now .
that &apos;s a global problem .
<unk> city .
and he got the snout of this . he &apos;s sorry to have his friends to have his family , to have to be able to get his family and his community .
they want -- you want to control themselves .
you know that for long long time , in this particular sense of this particular understanding .
we don &apos;t teach our kids .
and most of the kids get them .
well , supermarkets .
if you can cook , it doesn &apos;t matter .
in america , many of the wonderful things are happening , if we just look back .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of politically <unk> hackers .
the grid combines everything and it &apos;s going to be a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous does not have the information that &apos;s not going to win the financial .
he said to me how he was in new york on tour of the tour , and 10,000 dollars out of the $ food theater here , 30,000 dollars out of the atm machines , by using <unk> credit cards .
he was born in <unk> in a stable and and <unk> family , with play as teenagers with play as a teenager .
and most of the , with exception of script and <unk> , they didn &apos;t reveal the real social capabilities in the outside -- just in the grid .
i think there are several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into the detail , but some of the ones .
but they &apos;re all the market , and what the market is driving is particularly -- number one is the big demographic .
we also have a lot of examples of the world of the world of the <unk> of the world that are transformed into all kinds of social institutions , many schools , many of the way that this is here .
and finally , i expect the roads to the <unk> of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped encourage you to guarantee that eight of 13 regional <unk> are <unk> in <unk> plans to become <unk> .
the stream was carried from the parking lot .
their people are different than a typical <unk> , but they &apos;re less than cities than cities .
&quot; your vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole <unk> . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender , which is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the way exists in the body , and i think there are a real meaning , our bodies of our own culture -- that this separation has created an division that has been made the lead to the very end .
i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings because this is very lucky with happiness and with her .
maybe it &apos;s at my <unk> south carolina , which is not much smaller than today &apos;s hungary , and once from a future , a <unk> country .
well , maybe he was to be able to be , because he stayed where he was , long after the <unk> <unk> , and even after the <unk> and <unk> in budapest began .
and he got the same answer : &quot; do you get the best workers that you can find and if they &apos;re good enough , i &apos;m going to be . &quot;
and as it says , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all that beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; i said dr. robicsek , &quot; i &apos;ve been in the movie . &quot;
as i said , he <unk> too much .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re doing the most difficult cases , and order to order the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went to russia during the time of the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not more , it &apos;s going to keep it long until you go .
what i want to do with it -- i hope to clarify points .
and what i want to point later in the presentation , 50 percent of the united states are below the ocean .
it &apos;s because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is <unk> miles . the <unk> is on <unk> miles .
and so we went along with the <unk> of the <unk> , and found out the missing missing heat .
so i began to develop a new model of <unk> , with a <unk> , which replaces me , and i don &apos;t have to go up my vehicle .
we find the the one of the most popular .
and i looked at it yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle .
but i would like to leave a kid without license to the control of my tax .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , is just hard to be .
when we saw the effects of the <unk> , andrew , and i was that we had to make it up to so many people as possible to offer the most possible education .
what was the special about these courses ?
the video is cut up all the few minutes and the students will ask a question .
so , we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the most of the most important , that multiple <unk> is not as bad .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask questions that are the most frequent <unk> and how you can help the students , to repair it .
we actually see the beginning of a personalized <unk> or a <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and i think about what my first thought was , what infinity is when i was a kid .
and in our society , it &apos;s mostly about making the reality of the other .
i have my argument about the values of newton &apos;s science , like , for example , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a rational rational .
so , you can understand my surprise , when i got to read in the new yorker , that alan greenspan , <unk> <unk> <unk> , said , &quot; <unk> rand , his <unk> .
i think you can do something about the funny ones that have not been talking about , and not the ones that don &apos;t have , and that &apos;s why i don &apos;t have a jokes about kenneth <unk> and his charming <unk> .
i &apos;m already doing the old days of the <unk> , which i &apos;ll tell you .
he said , i would have to respect more respect because it can take to 18 years to be a good job .
huh ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid that the active one doesn &apos;t like us .
i talked about the thinking about the <unk> thought of beauty that she was talking about it , and that &apos;s called the <unk> in his book that can sometimes be beauty .
george bush : what the security costs of our security , and what the defenses costs our freedom , we need to pay the price . &quot;
10 years ago , no astronomer at the idea of 10 years ago , an astronomer , the idea of the idea -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are actually in danger .
he <unk> the time that an experiment with a particle particle and a <unk> , could destroy the world .
we have to be the same <unk> and the same way to <unk> .
so , we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do ?
and now , the worst thing .
we &apos;re using a lot of money to ensure that we don &apos;t die in a <unk> , but we don &apos;t give anything out of it , and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to be able to be able to get back on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
it &apos;s very , very important , because this is the system , the <unk> of life on the planet , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing realization , and we &apos;ve got it just since recently .
and this is what the system is <unk> , a number of plastic in southern hemisphere , in these circles .
everybody who later comes to the database of it just to the database , and can the information that needed to be done for everything .
we &apos;re the way to ride the wave of a ride , technological possibilities .
in a place , vast quantities of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the bottom of the sea .
the <unk> john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that are our oceans to global , interactive laboratory -- and in doing a <unk> of the world &apos;s surface .
so i think optimism is the architecture of what architecture drives architecture .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the <unk> against the <unk> . you know , too often , you want to understand .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true , the <unk> , as unexpected , will be always unexpected .
but i &apos;m going to make a little bit of a <unk> , and even with errors , instead of the same time , so that it &apos;s out of its insignificance .
risks of the rooms were never as <unk> as they should be in a very big city .
there are the emotions of the victims .
daniel <unk> : building on very large ideas . he &apos;s called the ones that of the vision of architecture -- raw , , <unk> , <unk> , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the car of all the car .
so , is something like that , or will it just be a few <unk> ?
em : you just have to do it . if not , we are in trouble .
using this capital , and install the <unk> on the roof , and then the <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> a <unk> , the lower , the <unk> , the <unk> .
we &apos;ve almost failed , but we &apos;ve got to the way back .
it &apos;s like a jet .
how about earth could be innovative so innovative ?
look at this .
boy when you &apos;re <unk> our cattle and a cross-section , like he eats one of our goats , it &apos;s very comfortable . then just go to him .
we were suffering .
our tradition looks like this : in every single hand , there is a holy fire .
so far , we were able to raise the world &apos;s world fund in the position to raise the very little programs on the <unk> scale .
it &apos;s important -- we invest the money in enlightenment and hiv .
<unk> -- again , again , a <unk> among many of the world &apos;s <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we hide this price behind the top .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> lead to be passionate about the <unk> revolution for <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , oysters , <unk> , <unk> -- that were the known species .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
the science sees the world through the sense of the sense of the sense of the , and we can be described , but you can have a frame for knowledge and knowledge .
from the plan of a few weeks after three weeks , a plan was a plan with 25 weeks .
this is the natural cycle .
this would not be a <unk> photographer , a photograph that &apos;s right , it &apos;s true , it &apos;s , but sometimes it has to be to show the way .
here you see how the glacier is pulling back .
so here have a couple of cameras here .
could india be the origin of the origin of innovation , just like it &apos;s a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
if we asked to talk to people in these <unk> , they were doing the most of them , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products .
you cannot be a professor , if you weren &apos;t even graduate .
the best hospitals in the doctors for the treatments for the treatments , and in <unk> , <unk> , heart disease , for artificial <unk> , <unk> at 4 a.m.
it works a little bit like -- this is a recent <unk> <unk> in the morning .
i said , i know a <unk> message when i see a look .
everybody in our society comes in touch with cancer -- if not personally , by a beloved people , a family member , a mine , a friend , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve been able tumor treating tumor treating fields in the lab at about 20 different types of cancer , and we see this effect .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in sixth months of the tumor , and it starts to be <unk> .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new project , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet , and collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from your courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , it looks like this .
somewhere , a stream , or a <unk> <unk> through this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; in english , we have <unk> and water .
and they have to go down .
these are the beautiful stairs that we just saw on one of the visuals .
and <unk> are about 27 percent : 600,000 people have a year in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in the local , people who get out of the <unk> and they &apos;re moving toward the way to the and wealth .
and the countries on the right , you see the <unk> , basically , every country with a <unk> of a <unk> , we say less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of say three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , it didn &apos;t grow .
buy african products .
but i think a much bigger problem that is that that logic -- that we should put ipods and not bombs , i mean , it would be a great title for thomas <unk> new book .
so , there are 500 people to get to and four of them were chosen to visit the institution and they &apos;re to <unk> to get them to <unk> .
so now citizens are now citizens in planning to planning in planning , by 2020 , not necessarily something about it , because it &apos;s still the dictators who control agenda .
<unk> <unk> : the internet makes the worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was up with us younger guys .
because for me , who lived in this period of time and in this <unk> , the question was , &quot; you want to be , &quot; you want to have a <unk> or drugs -- and we didn &apos;t take care of drugs .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as a indian , and now , and i &apos;m a lot of the <unk> , which is our country , concerned about all the talk about india as a new <unk> , even the new superpower .
in other words , all kinds of stories of stories about countries , regardless of the people who want to get to the of the people who want them to daylight or not .
but , but the death in our country at the time , it took about half an hour to a call call , until a call , a call .
it can &apos;t understand the conversation .
this can sometimes unwanted consequences . ok .
and those of you who have the money , you may have been surprised to see how many <unk> <unk> are in the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> .
i went home and i had some of a little bit of a little bit , and i found some shocking statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a <unk> man .
and now i &apos;m feeling like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , a , , a passage that i just love love , and i would love you to read them : &quot;
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be , mother nature would have a problem : how do we get chimpanzees to mate with the world ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious , and therefore i &apos;ve got it .
ok ? stop . now , this won .
i don &apos;t know why there are <unk> <unk> , but no matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i suspect , in fact , the most reason why we probably know why we &apos;re very , very quick .
it &apos;s what it looks like . you should see this as this .
bob <unk> has a different -- a different version of this exercise was done in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a much more efficient than the creative results , if all of the things are all concerned about the rules .
and suddenly , there was a tremendous conversation about design about a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to that .
you know what it feels like , all of those insecurity , as long as you go back in the corridor , as long as you go back in the corridor , in one of the <unk> , you &apos;re going to take a <unk> case , and you wonder what &apos;s going on .
and that &apos;s why we all have a feeling of , and we have a good time because we agree on the rules and agreed with it .
we do everything that leads to success , but then if we are there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re looking back at all of the things that we &apos;ve done successfully .
i was faster , but as depressed .
i &apos;ve learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the <unk> is just filled with hot girls . &quot;
i actually said , &quot; oh my god , &quot; -- hopefully , for always , the last time in public .
he made sure that everything fit together .
it took 900 people to do it .
and the second thing is , people obviously , a genuine connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberals democracies , the society , the state , not only to determine our own selves , but it requires to be able to do it .
it means that we &apos;re going to satisfy our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers of questions that i want to run with today -- the question : what are the intentions that are coming to the application , if you design something ?
and that &apos;s why i said , and my colleague , sebastian <unk> , we have to give us that better .
and we succeeded .
i &apos;ll give one in the fall .
he <unk> them in the right position , <unk> it with his nose and leave .
we were the first surprise .
there had to be some kind of <unk> to produce a lot of the power to produce a lot of force and the speed we observe and the the the <unk> of the system .
a load cell is measuring forces , and this is actually a <unk> load cell with a crystal .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to be the <unk> and the load cell .
a very , very <unk> solution for the particular problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s the ocean .
i think this is one of the most beautiful classical <unk> that the ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , not even <unk> , that this is a three-dimensional structure .
now look at this -- it &apos;s just standing .
the one that last year , this is this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- -- i apologize for the obvious example -- isn &apos;t the right approach we need to choose .
basically , new york on the back of the <unk> , our streets of their shells .
in these eight rooms of chambers , little <unk> , which are basically <unk> .
so you walked around in london , and it was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
finally , snow created a map of the eruption .
and this is happening every week .
i made her <unk> on the top of the <unk> temple .
and in this area of the amazon , in the amazon , in the amazon .
the other side of the area is <unk> <unk> , where is actually supposed to stop osama bin laden &apos;s supposed to stop . this is <unk> .
this was one of the big <unk> .
this is the <unk> . so , let me move the hubble <unk> deep field deep field .
but then you get to jupiter , and it &apos;s 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
this is part of the part of the understanding of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so , the stuff that &apos;s white white , dark matter .
when you saw this image for the first time , you can &apos;t see a lot of them .
this is a simulation of the <unk> of a month , just to just to make this visible .
with <unk> , we have a resolution , which is about this image of the earth , where you can actually detect the complicated pattern of the earth .
and in the course , we &apos;re stressed .
47 percent .
this is crazy . we &apos;re going to do this in the everyday life .
i got into a vicious cycle , which led to many pain and problems with the joints , so that i could almost keep in almost .
i asked me why you could be more creative , if you seek to the constraints ?
this is not happening from this morning .
so the time of <unk> is an duty of <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> . there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
stalin &apos;s <unk> famine in the &apos; 30s , killing millions of <unk> . in the 1940s , they looked at the nazis , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , many of the women were getting up as <unk> as <unk> after germany .
the one is the <unk> . &quot;
and as a marketer , i think , the idea most of the most of what we &apos;ve learned in virtual world over us , and we have our identity , to live a better life in the real world .
we get to a new way to be in the way alone .
human relationships are <unk> , chaotic and <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
because at the moment , in the moment , in the people , even for a few seconds , they &apos;re going to get <unk> , <unk> , panic , they &apos;re going to reach out of an electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in truth , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have any of the <unk> , which some of our students were predicted , and quite often , quite often , i felt that they had their predictions on the financial species .
maybe , because my father &apos;s always owned by the end .
so i put them in calm -- but it &apos;s been very , and it was to be , you had to be .
finally , i thought i was a pyramid , but i &apos;m going to do the time to go into it .
although you &apos;re losing , not afraid of failure , if we have the <unk> , because who can be a people , than anything he can do .
if i want to call it name , i never know what an answer .
did i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials , they &apos;re trying to use different types of stem cells for heart disease .
it &apos;s only last month , it &apos;s been able to show us this technology that we &apos;ve succeeded in the building of human rights .
we can map them and map 360 degrees , and we can apply the kidney in all its <unk> properties , and then we can just print this information and then print them by <unk> .
i couldn &apos;t go to school . i just went dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to . i want to do this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new section of the <unk> is called the <unk> .
and connected to this <unk> , you have examples of all over the world -- from the election of a president to the <unk> of the <unk> of the and everything in between -- what the power of a lot of things could achieve .
third , <unk> , <unk> issues .
because what you need , this is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want the music that she plays .
i &apos;m hot joseph and bin laden in kenya .
we have to go our wives and children , we have to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure .
late late night , i went home with the batteries and ice .
together : anybody <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , to the masters in moscow and working on work on work on this .
it can be huge expenditure , but if the city of x <unk> can win for y hours , the <unk> of the <unk> of the city &apos;s labor .
they have <unk> , tables and data .
so , that &apos;s where 18 minutes i &apos;ve been given to be here , between two and <unk> people who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and he was in a <unk> <unk> mud .
the building here have a half stories .
these green things are the foreground .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> , you have political activity .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true to that dream .
think about it . those men who didn &apos;t have the same <unk> as i was able to get to <unk> , to get educated , to get educated in the <unk> .
at the time , <unk> were just <unk> with a <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , he could develop a machine that could read any <unk> .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport those books across the border , in the various english language , different versions of <unk> : britain , united states , canada , canada , canada , australia , the <unk> , and new zealand had to have had to have all kinds of <unk> of harry potter .
the <unk> . lifetime has been over the past as doubled as doubled , and it grows to a speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . do you want to be happy , okay ?
second is the new age machine machine , because when the <unk> takes the jobs , we don &apos;t have to do it , and that keeps us more drudgery and <unk> us .
the societal challenges of this inequality should be <unk> .
the economic playbook is surprising to be clear , and surprisingly straightforward , especially in the brief view .
and my greatest concern is that we create a world , with <unk> technologies , embedded in a a society , and it &apos;s been able to be in a economy , which is inequality rather than possibilities .
over the course of the years , i began to feel more <unk> with this notion of god .
some have a few have <unk> that we can only believe in a god that &apos;s our pain .
in the second <unk> , the line is the line , &quot; the wind and waves obey him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the lovers soul of the universe .
by the way the god in the , i mean , my own <unk> <unk> .
one of the first things i started studying was the story of the most famous &quot; technology .
we have no <unk> <unk> that were older than 40 years , and the average age of those hunter-gatherer hunter-gatherer tribes and tribes are 20 to 30 to 30 .
our bodies have to be used to these new diet .
so this is the equality of energy and the matter , which is the einstein pointed , and also the modern science of the <unk> , the entropy and information and energy and energy and energy are all connected , so there &apos;s a long continuum .
so this is a robot that &apos;s your own plug in your own plug , to get more power .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re looking for a new job .
a great trend that has begun billions of years ago , moving around us and continues , and our choice is in the technology , is really in the way , is really in terms of the force that much more powerful than we .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five classes <unk> 30 to 40 students .
we demolished that all the way , and we found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it had a look -- as we &apos;ve got , , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of the ship . &quot;
so we waited , we &apos;ve been waiting for the table and we &apos;ve been waiting for the table .
there are many <unk> . the only problem , specifically for the adults who work at the <unk> who have nothing really knew when they started was that there was only a toilet .
the teachers who we work with -- it &apos;s different from teachers -- they tell us what we &apos;re supposed to do .
about 170 tutors have worked with them on the book , and so this is wonderful .
and just in the -- there &apos;s usually a little bit of a little chain -- just as they saw children , they were taught .
there are also these <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see if you &apos;re in the <unk> , but it opens up slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s got his cousin .
write an email , he &apos;ll ask you any question you can imagine , you can see .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of the refugees in the world are women and children .
there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace is the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace is the creation of schools and creating jobs .
she sent their kids to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one that &apos;s the manual &quot; manual &quot; <unk> , &quot; did you know that ?
on the cape , there are <unk> roads , and we all can go here .
this is my baby . thank you very much .
he said basically , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a sense , i felt always badly .
so i came to this kind of complications .
i found out that very good <unk> are .
and the is the most difficult thing , so it &apos;s a number of hard .
and in fact , in a weird <unk> of <unk> , about the <unk> , the moment of the street , the moment in front of my house , and the white <unk> was <unk> in the sun .
and i became a lot of the great presentation from karen armstrong from the <unk> of religion , but it &apos;s really understood not really understand , but to do with behavior .
the <unk> has seen , geographically , the same size , it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it has exactly the same size as the united states , <unk> an area that is roughly the size of the state .
but it &apos;s not just the industrialized countries .
we cannot wait for the <unk> that had been the way of the political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we have in the sense of this challenge .
before i show you a few pictures of the <unk> , i want to make this beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
so this is that in this case , really , an extraordinary school .
we &apos;ve been talking about keith <unk> , that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful to your lectures , fear of being being seen as silly <unk> .
here are examples that you can actually print ultraviolet cells in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that &apos;s what robots for us are thinking about .
no . so i had to think a little sharper .
we did the same thing for iraq .
so this was a challenge we had to ask ourselves as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces are more . there are more of them , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; <unk> seven &quot; <unk> a whole band .
and there are some employees in the foundations that are called the <unk> .
the idea of justice that our lives are and gives us a sense of what &apos;s right in life , which is just what &apos;s just in life , what we should do , social justice .
and as this is , he <unk> during the <unk> .
so every week , the <unk> show up . &quot; god , you &apos;ve got me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection or an operation .
the muscles were labeled , paralyzed -- <unk> like this .
we do it with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- that &apos;s frankly , frankly , in this kind of pain , are not very effective .
now , you get a sense of how much we rock here .
it was 1908 . it doesn &apos;t matter . it can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see him from the back rows of all . that &apos;s just stars .
in 2005 , nasa launched a spacecraft called &quot; deep impact , &quot; which one -- it &apos;s a part of the <unk> of the nucleus of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and we are that we can have a <unk> and choose , and therefore we can change our future .
at that time , i led to <unk> , the only independent to be precise , the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that <unk> could survive and a great company would be , if <unk> was going to be gone , what turned out to be right .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it won &apos;t work , you &apos;ll never see your money again , but my foundation is going to put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can actually test the idea .
and we said that -- that &apos;s fine , we meet , and you &apos;re bringing us your business plan , which they actually did .
see , we started in east and <unk> with our work and we went to russia .
after a while , we opened a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea of making bonds , bonds on the free press .
and in this way , you do the supply of the funding , so that there are no <unk> , no blind , they &apos;re running around to find out .
so why does it work ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some of the name is a theory of everything .
just example , this is what newton found the law of gravity , which works as one of the <unk> of the <unk> between each other .
the more symmetry you have , the better you do , simplicity and elegance in theory .
one thing he thought about , most of us today , but at its time , it didn &apos;t take away from that .
it doesn &apos;t look the meaning of the product that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and accidents .
but he read in every moment he had , books .
from that ambition , he went back to the <unk> .
but when he was just trying to put his signature under the <unk> , his hand was deaf deaf and shaking , because he had a thousand hands during the morning , he had a thousand hands during the morning .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the white house .
but i have to say , the older i got , the more i understand , what was an incredible privilege that was to be with this aging , for the <unk> lion from a man &apos;s <unk> ?
and as lincoln was told the story , all the war , all the war .
i said , my dad , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to be the story that allows me to spend a life in the past .
he had the temple and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is the proof that the jews in babylon , after all the years , they were in babylon to the rivers , and at the spirit of the <unk> , that they could go home .
all of those of those are respects .
the <unk> cylinder is from the great <unk> of the <unk> of the great <unk> of the <unk> , by the <unk> .
you all know what happened then .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of thousands of iran in iran .
some of you know more about the world &apos;s life , but they think they &apos;re a <unk> thing .
the newly <unk> babies cried in the first few hours , but their needs didn &apos;t meet and they didn &apos;t join and eventually , they didn &apos;t get <unk> , and they start to the air , like everybody else .
a study shows that <unk> 10 percent of a cost costs , as average , about 30 percent .
and that became me , because i had almost been a a a camera in a camera .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you have to do a answer to the answer .
it was <unk> people -- most of them , and family .
we heard each one .
but of course he never came . the explanation has never happened .
and after many , many , many , many , i was excited that this man , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , it has done to get unicef into the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the people who believed in peace and possibilities , etc . , etc . and they were actually going to be really .
we connect with <unk> -- i &apos;ve met <unk> <unk> , and i said , &quot; at london 2012 , it &apos;s about the truce .
it &apos;s about your <unk> , and you &apos;re your business .
the biggest brains of the world should be the most cognitively .
i <unk> the national literature , but i couldn &apos;t find them .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , what we &apos;ve invented our ancestors to a year and a half years ago when they discovered what the cook .
quite simple approaches for the most of the most amazing conversations that i did .
and i think i &apos;m just on the beginning .
but as soon as the fight is <unk> , the physical rehabilitation was facing .
behind him , a kid , his son , red in his face in his face of effort , his dad .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
at night , i spoke with my bosses in the headquarters and i said , i was -- i was going to take a look , &quot; look , we &apos;re starting to start with a few hours a day , just for some repairs . &quot;
so two groups of <unk> started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s it ? &quot;
&quot; but yeah , we have to increase the production of your feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not only in the orthopedic center , but also in the houses of people .
and they should see me during a <unk> .
and this hospital could have been able to afford .
why ? because the way i did was we had been banned .
but i learned something more than that , because the leader of the economy -- hugely bad decisions that our economy had done in the verge of the .
because i knew that the state of the african continent for my children and whose kids would be important .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience i had to be in swarthmore to get to africa .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from which a great society can rise in a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s very similar to the yellow ball of the <unk> , the sun we draw as a children .
in fact , this is something that half of them , more than half of them , you &apos;re not familiar with .
32 pills &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> . &quot;
and those are the messages that they &apos;re passionate ?
because , in the bottom , the canary love , and so he &apos;s going to turn them on television .
a professional <unk> who are talking about dead , they didn &apos;t get me ?
what is <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to get away from you , how to make <unk> , <unk> and community community , so that they do something .
thank you .
and that &apos;s why the entire hospital is just about a generator .
it has to give something better . &quot;
but the user control is control , whether it &apos;s just electricity , or not , because they can steer the <unk> on the ground , how much percent of the oxygen you give you .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and <unk> device that we can do for the hospital .
the various kinds of writing in africa , the first was <unk> the script that the <unk> <unk> describes what the <unk> is a secret society of the <unk> of the <unk> .
anyway , as a <unk> photographer named john <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in the preceding century .
almost one fifth of all greenhouse gases emissions from the <unk> -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the <unk> of the <unk> and animals on the lines lines are not just so fine .
<unk> was a <unk> .
a picture of <unk> would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would think that maybe not that bad thing .
and i asked a question about a year : &quot; why am i know , &quot; why am i know , no , a vegetarian ? &quot;
the weekend you have the election .
you can do a picture with an iphone and all the names , even though it &apos;s even more mistakes .
it &apos;s being lost . he finally won the races .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too large .
you would mean , it was interested in interest in terms of the way that are so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or an aesthetic experience -- an sunset or a big artwork .
human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have a ethical level in the way of that -- is that they are intrinsic valuable .
it could be more complicated in humans , but maybe not very .
jh : is it <unk> with these forces ?
and i knew the same thing i knew , i know , i need to take some remote control .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the fluid .
and i think that can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio .
we take the pizza , our very first pizza , and the the only skin , as the messenger stands in the hallway and we <unk> .
i was certainly 20 before i first went to an art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you want to choose the works .
it &apos;s not photoshopped work .
they were interested in creating a novel , alternative , <unk> , and they needed money , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave , and we did this , it was very concrete -- the attention we got .
and she describes the <unk> of the <unk> -- all she &apos;s like , is like the <unk> of the <unk> fruit .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s related to origami . so we go .
people used mathematical principles to the art of the world to understand the underlying theory .
or they &apos;re doing it on the top and make 50 stars , and they &apos;re going to be 13 .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found this rules that you put bubbles , you &apos;re using the <unk> lines , the little rules . that &apos;s the crease pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to do it bigger , you could need something origami .
and that doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re in space or whether you &apos;re in a body .
i grew up in a <unk> state in the state of washington with much more time on the state of washington .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about it for hours .
and therefore i want to talk about it , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this is the <unk> of this .
and in a moment i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re seeing in the graph -- it starts in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start to <unk> the labor industry , and it goes on to the day .
you were instruction on top .
because i &apos;m talking about all the book , i &apos;m still standing , and i don &apos;t answer the answer .
and that was very daunting for them .
since we haven &apos;t fully processed this information , they come back to us in the form of culture culture , in this weird , and most overblown , where you can see that stereotypical change .
there &apos;s no man or not a woman who is in the middle line , and it &apos;s the cable in the middle .
and with the personal income on a scale , the constant is being kept in order to account at that time , in that time , more than doubled , almost nearly .
and to hear me , and understand what i say , you need to take about 60 bits per second .
and then , it &apos;s happening , so in the last book , i &apos;ve interviewed a few ceos , which is a lot of ceos who are very successful and at the same time , very successful , with great social professionals , with great social professionals .
control is always a safe thing , because you feel in your mind , but not quite a very rapid .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning , which is home , they had their meaning for community community , and even for hostility , which was born with them from birth to <unk> . they didn &apos;t really have the way to go beyond .
more and more people are the future or present , as the past .
i went down to the room i should sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where is you home ?
there was a large gap between the industrialized countries , and the two billion in the developing world .
but this is the world that we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by me to the <unk> digital technology .
and the kids survive the kids is the new green .
and again , they were better than we , &quot; your brits and your mortality rate is shocking . &quot;
but if you have people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i started to work with <unk> , and they made them grow , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice who couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother , and i don &apos;t know how old it is .
you could be the same as well on the equator .
certainly many advances , many of the <unk> live .
this is even real photography , in retrospect , that shows that the limb is in a little bit of a few days .
and here you see , what six months later , the technically <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> is comprised of two different types .
we put it back into this <unk> device .
even more complex organs , with the size of the complex solid organs , the high <unk> of the organs , with each of <unk> organs as heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that are not going to be prohibited , and not tumors .
we need to have five seconds .
for any problem there anybody would have a idea .
so i &apos;m just a little bit of panic , unlike all of the <unk> and the sugar , i had -- but this is an entrepreneur for an entrepreneur .
it doesn &apos;t mean you have to go to a <unk> .
i went to door and sells <unk> .
it &apos;s like a recession . so there is a recession .
and you would do these chairs .
it &apos;s pointless . &quot; you have to get a way to get to the money .
i sold a ton of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the opportunity to find more jobs , and they learn the ability to be , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go to a restaurant and you &apos;re going to use it , you show you how bad <unk> looks like .
these boys , <unk> .
the development of the present students is , all of the interests of the time .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , most of our students .
the values of the past are also <unk> . that &apos;s getting a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a policy of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a spirit . and they have other people .
what we should think about when we think about conservative -- except this case of the 1980s , what &apos;s going to be , you go to church .
yeah , i know , i know , you don &apos;t really believe me .
and that leads not just another outcome , it has the potential to change how we handle .
completely different .
in fact , it &apos;s not the right organization , but clear -- let me finish that -- creative commons offers a simple way to the freedoms that you want to leave you with .
john mccain .
and i wonder how much of the things happened .
he told me that he was the <unk> <unk> , and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re now going to get out there . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i had them through this process and show you how this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general , they were very happy .
i survived , we just understand ourselves .
i &apos;m going to ask people all the time , &quot; is it possible to use these microbial ecosystems to use these microbial ecosystems ? &quot;
another way of how microbes can spread , it &apos;s the people , and architects are like to <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> like to encourage human interaction or exchange to the exchange of ideas for example and offices .
imagine a design of the microbes , for example , on the airplane or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , he was rejected by the <unk> .
and greenpeace wanted to the <unk> , and a method that you wanted to achieve this , was a <unk> of these humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback humpback
at 78 percent of the voices . to give you an idea of the <unk> defeat : which is the <unk> , which is only three percent .
and the last message i want to tell you is , you can be pretty successful .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a great privilege is to stand today before you stand today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in the in the in the world are <unk> .
just like that .
good morning . magic is a good way to be able to be able to be able to make the difference that science really will be .
there are color red and color color , they &apos;re the <unk> shift from day at night .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good sheet .
this is an illusion .
so that &apos;s china , a civilization-state , and not that much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t have a country like china , on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason why , first , the state in china gets a very special -- certainly a very special emphasis than the <unk> , the embodiment and the <unk> of the chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was in the <unk> of the long , connected beijing and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the <unk> -- which is the position of the <unk> -- or the <unk> .
he drives up a street in the court , and the cars drive underneath it .
red = blue equals blue = green = green = <unk> <unk> <unk> equals <unk> <unk> .
and the first song was in english , the second one was in chinese .
she agreed to her song .
i made graffiti , i wrote my name all over the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the face of my friends .
they all have accepted that their image was going to be put next to each other .
&quot; you think you &apos;re <unk> a <unk> face -- that &apos;s a funny piece of a funny line , right ? &quot;
and most places i went , decided i decided to go to the media , i had heard about them in the media .
i took more pictures and we launched the project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were elected , <unk> , &quot; now , god can see me . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind every photograph .
but they actually have basically taken me a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
when i think about the mesh and what it drives them , why it &apos;s now , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a <unk> .
they have a trend trend .
zipcar started a decade ago in 2000 .
it challenges to be part of the , cities , have been <unk> by <unk> .
it &apos;s very inexpensive , and it &apos;s very &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the last 40 years were extraordinary times .
and also , miniaturization .
that would be a powerful <unk> .
it &apos;s vital that the ted <unk> ideas are ideas about which we think about , and make sure that this is a particularly glorious century , and not one of <unk> and <unk> .
my my left family are boring , who are trying to collect <unk> from <unk> <unk> to our <unk> .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he would be crazy , but something that was really stuck .
i was sitting , like , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since then netra became my career , i got a lot of success .
i began to study the <unk> of the human psyche .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much of the things . einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 between all the today &apos;s einstein &apos;s climate , in fact , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you were going to fall off .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , you have the problem , you know ?
sw : big finish .
sw : what about a <unk> ?
my parents found this important for her internal quiet .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s kind of things apart from which i have <unk> .
the body has higher density than the water , at least 95 percent of the body .
and this is going to get them very much .
i asked him what this means .
at this point , you can imagine , you can see , multiple languages and they take them out without each other .

steven so does his story . but it &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people are praying .
i also love this <unk> cochlear implant , including this , the only <unk> that were online and available online .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have a <unk> , you have no data , that doesn &apos;t run the scientific methods .
this is the curve of the <unk> .
but my brother didn &apos;t , he went to end with him .
if we went from here today , we would hit the something that was 300 meters tall , 120 miles wide , so 28 miles wide , and that &apos;s two gigatons .
to change the condition , you need to just take two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do that .
but there &apos;s a very intriguing solution that &apos;s called the so-called <unk> .
they are <unk> , they are using complex systems .
and it has also been affecting the systemic risk .
so we could put a <unk> of each other .
we see the emergence of <unk> and <unk> programs that are focused on to understand our structural world from the point of complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity of <unk> capacity -- unless you use expensive pumps and the <unk> .
and we had 500 of those <unk> prepared .
no human <unk> .
so we were up on our <unk> .
and this graph doesn &apos;t mean , it &apos;s not even something that data invented is invented .
and my brain starts to think very quickly that this is a <unk> representation of the world &apos;s <unk> to the world .
because this is a question suggesting that our external definition of world can predict our <unk> , but the truth is that i can predict 10 percent of the <unk> of a person , if i can predict its entire external world .
and that &apos;s a very important scientific <unk> and <unk> around .
we &apos;re going people to write their <unk> , a positive email of the <unk> of the <unk> of somebody &apos;s <unk> in their social environment .
it &apos;s hard to say -- a <unk> , you understand -- my dad was the most famous man in the world .
and so i went . i went to mit , closed .
they said , do it .
they take a huge disk of cardboard .
he was the first digital largest digital world .
listen ? how cows ? this is in the morning in the morning .
so there are all those things to do , but most of the love i love to see the world , to taste .
and i &apos;m very eager with passion .
their culture comes in schools not , and i want to show you how we can transcend this problem .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go schools where there are no boys .
and i &apos;m going to live in my life .
or moms who brought up boys ?
we have to change the stance to boys in primary school .
and you have the idea that you think that &apos;s okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that this &quot; why can we give us this &quot; why can we give us why to be able to give us why to be able to give us why .
i &apos;m going to be doing that , the end , and i &apos;m just excited , whether it works .
and that was really an important lesson for me to be able to actually act on an object .
we have a newspaper , for example , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s related to my ipad , and this is a software that &apos;s on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> , so i &apos;m going to add you to a <unk> , so that people are different in the glass , so that people are different when you &apos;re coming up .
i &apos;m going to turn into a man &apos;s middle of a man , and then in an old man .
<unk> <unk> were allowed .
radio : what do you think about it ?
just fold up the wings together , and they keep them .
so i &apos;m asking you a different question .
and he made a royal <unk> , with <unk> , the instruction had to <unk> him day and night , but with the secret instruction , but with secret instruction , but with secret instruction , not particularly good at the <unk> .
because they have figured out that <unk> human behavior is more powerful .
yet we have to create a very clearly <unk> <unk> , where you can create this type of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of fair .
now if we have all those tools , we have to just ask the question -- and thaler and <unk> did this -- how we use this intelligent use .
they &apos;re going to have a new <unk> .
they &apos;re a little , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i felt , passion , soul and heart , had my body left .
audience : no .
sb : no , no , no .
all around us , <unk> <unk> , let &apos;s turn on a different replicator in this <unk> of culture .
you probably bought them .
imagine the world of brains and more memes than the place for you .
we &apos;re the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
it was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to produce the resource of the planet to produce more and more and more amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and will we see this third danger , how we &apos;ve got the second one and the first ever ever come out .
in collaboration with <unk> -- this is the <unk> in haiti -- with the department of public <unk> , with various <unk> , we inspected more than 1,500 buildings .
it won &apos;t cost us more if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had a half of 70 percent of my body , it took about an hour .
we also figured that it would have been well , if you were to go back to me , then you &apos;ve given me to the pain of the pain .
and how bad would sound like if i was caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the <unk> people -- who have more commandments -- less cheated , and that less religious -- the people who are almost no trouble to almost ever commandments -- more <unk> .
so if you don &apos;t think for a few seconds , you &apos;re not thinking about money , because you get a brand brand , it does that ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think that all these forces are very bad effects on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i &apos;m working in the commercial .
so , these are the most <unk> that i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon will be the brand and competing with the <unk> , how they want to spend money , what money is and what it is .
maybe that seems to be a big leap ?
the audience i don &apos;t have to tell you , i &apos;m not going to explain -- last week , i had to explain my nine-year-old -- penises are structures that <unk> sperm from an individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the <unk> of the <unk> , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissue by using them over bones .
and that was that every single skeleton that we found in nature , over the same <unk> .
all of whom i showed that was really surprised about this .
a funny song about global warming , by jill sobule .
all right , i must say .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> , are the benefits of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> is totally from about this , and it &apos;s got to a <unk> .
so on , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home to leave the democratic republic of congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> has been estimated the united nations , the united nations , the united nations , over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they have to stand very affordable .
but could not be done for the point of the <unk> ?
they were asked by governments , and in many cases they have them , they have them .
but suppose we &apos;re going to take our goal to be able to take a new economic act on the basis of the pyramid .
because she &apos;s actually going to be a whole bunch of of these little transactions to make their profit .
he liked it on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
in the case , as sir <unk> <unk> , and the british society for <unk> thought that &apos;s why the sun seems .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s something <unk> .
and this is what the energy is <unk> .
so high as high as much as much .
we have to do it to a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arabic country , and it &apos;s also a great influence .
they wanted to most democracy , but they were all the people who had had their opinion on the last month , and was stated to a civil war -- it was only four percent .
but the expectations of people are getting great about their future .
so the question is to say , &quot; what drives the male support for women &apos;s women ? &quot;
i promise you , you know the news .
nobody can tell you , they just have a text to text .
you could see the firsthand effects of the laws of the <unk> , or the <unk> talk on a <unk> , and see what happens as a consequence .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 feet .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> .
from the smallest <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of nature .
we can afford to be able to do in the than individuals and listen to hearing .
we believe that somebody else , somebody else , somebody who is somebody who is a little bit of , to solve this problem .
we flew it in the pacific .
it took 10 to a full prototype , until we had something that was really flying .
and so there &apos;s an incredible <unk> of what &apos;s possible , and this is what it is possible , and this is what it means .
and we think of our moral moral .
and the director was pretty <unk> , and he said that he thought it was crazy , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are severe offenders .
it took me several of those things until i figured out what i should do .
when i began to this program , my <unk> plan began to create a <unk> of the <unk> .
and you look down to <unk> , everything is so small and tiny .
i &apos;m feeling so blessed and fortunate that i had the guts to my post on time on time and to my home home , where i can do these incredible rides with this group of <unk> kids from ethiopia , and the <unk> .
and how many times would my self have to die , before i understand that it didn &apos;t exist from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly enough , <unk> don &apos;t know my <unk> sense of the <unk> of the <unk> of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have myself , which was between between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we honor the inevitable death of the self , the privilege of life and to enjoy what next is coming .
and this is a cafe in the sea in the u.k.
but instead of what we &apos;re focused focused on how we do .
we also discovered that the way that a <unk> structure and a <unk> way that we would get through this structure .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project , and that seed -- but that seeds -- in the leading <unk> gardens , they won &apos;t have the seeds .
we worked with a <unk> system to develop a <unk> of the seed cathedral , so even if you &apos;re a storyteller , it was kind of <unk> and <unk> , the piece of the , you see here .
it &apos;s actually the first few of the <unk> that you see , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book called &quot; blank slate , &quot; the popular idea of the human mind , the human mind is a blank slate , all its structure from its <unk> , culture , education and experience .
well , there are a number of political reasons for you to make people well .
it &apos;s still not clear that these stats are accurate , but it seemed to be the <unk> of this .
one of the most <unk> and <unk> in the universities , which is in in terms of in in terms of in in terms of in in terms of in in terms of in in terms of in .
well , the other hot iron is the result .
and i think you can &apos;t do this , you can &apos;t say it .
i also don &apos;t like the <unk> , just like <unk> , and you don &apos;t like it , but you &apos;re telling it .
there is no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no <unk> .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like , what i think is . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked me what if we challenge some of these <unk> <unk> .
right ?
it &apos;s the way -- we &apos;ve been talking to war , as a society , each of us .
your iphone without the people who are the same shell , the same <unk> , the same <unk> , and over again .
and then it became thicker and thicker and now it &apos;s been <unk> pages .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , is it true that you have fake in the fake ? &quot;
but how do you sit in a regular sense ?
so all the things that came in the <unk> , the proof of his clinician , he was to be crazy in this new way .
he came in <unk> in <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> 30 percent of the workforce , american cities just moved in <unk> .
and i put myself , &quot; i have a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the jewelry are always the most of the most of the things of the interviewee .
anyway , that was two years ago , and this is where my book ended .
in fact , the trend went to the world &apos;s <unk> from the rest of the world .
and as a result of this <unk> , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i &apos;m <unk> the true . &quot;
it may be that a large war between east east and west <unk> , and that it was necessary in the fundamental democracy for communism .
and although president were doing , for <unk> , , very well , it &apos;s very well done to <unk> the islam , it &apos;s actually felt a natural pulse in the <unk> of the other side as an enemy .
when the treasure treasure went down in 2000 , you just watch the peak of the best <unk> that the scientists had ever had the same -- that was at this point as endangered species .
the day after the day , two of us have been talking about the <unk> of the time , and the <unk> 2 novel than 4,000 with oil were oiled penguins .
we have this method in the treasure rescue .
and that &apos;s really important because african penguin a year ago , a endangered way of it was been .
on the <unk> row , the <unk> , front of a <unk> , in the <unk> , and even before the police station .
people are open for the <unk> .
we launched this campaign -- very , very , , called &quot; every egg . &quot;
this is not a <unk> of the second grade .
these are <unk> , abstract .
hillel put himself on a leg and said , &quot; what &apos;s you <unk> , it &apos;s not the fault of your neighbor . that &apos;s the <unk> . the rest are commentary .
now , this is not the whole story .
and achilles picks up <unk> <unk> and hands to your <unk> , and the two men see each other and detect each other as divine .
so this is what the cells actually have in the biology and science in the way that we look at the living cells in the microscope .
each grain of grain has a size of a tenth of a millimeter .
you can see these <unk> .
this is the beginning of the <unk> .
we &apos;re all seeing the same from the inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 700 700 of 700 concrete .
and that on the left is an x-ray .
it has human associations .
in the blink of the , we see all the little <unk> in the corners .
i had to <unk> the car in the middle , for you , it doesn &apos;t really work .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys for a week , and after that week , they just used it as a toilet .
the science says that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m <unk> a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you very much .
how do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we don &apos;t agree .
not a professor and <unk> , just two people , ready to <unk> .
and then my life was fine .
everything i saw in the manufacture was that there were right <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
would then be time to process the information ?
we &apos;ve spent a lot of time to a billion dollars of a business -- you &apos;re going to be right now -- a billion <unk> <unk> , which he was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but later , more .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were horrified that these shell companies were rapidly <unk> their <unk> and the most important in london companies are very <unk> .
it &apos;s too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all the old . we &apos;re all sick . people are leaving us .
there are places that you can &apos;t go to the idea that you can &apos;t think of , you cannot &apos;t think of the way you can &apos;t actually inhabit .
they have a <unk> and a freedom of what i believe is the foundation of a new computer .
it has made the decision to get to not <unk> or <unk> , but your life is to be that this is not a child .
we are all refugees .
but you put this thing on the head , and then it happens .
but this is not doing this . &quot;
i was really michael .
he didn &apos;t know , he didn &apos;t know his staff , but they said , &quot; you &apos;re going to recovery , or you &apos;re going to die and die . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the <unk> , let &apos;s pull out .
when it &apos;s on the box , which is the <unk> , then it forms it .
the the characteristics that the the word &quot; <unk> are often to see that we should abolish this old <unk> word from the age of being able to critique behavior that is associated with <unk> and <unk> .
if i was the ability to <unk> my sister , the 10 percent of the interest i have on your last loan , i &apos;ll have your ability to get more money from me to get it back .
it &apos;s why we &apos;re not going to live in the dark days .
and the third is all the sounds that we create people , the <unk> .
that &apos;s what we logging .
there are many <unk> of <unk> , including the way animals to dance and sing that i have a different time .
so that was extremely painful .
and if you wonder how much that is , this is the <unk> here , this is 16 kb .
so , 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very powerful and a very nice concert .
and those are the issues that are really at the heart of us .
one generation that makes much more important from video games than the real world .
all of those are problems outside of my <unk> .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games are for our civilization .
finally , let &apos;s stop . that was it .
he would like that pretty well .
so , you get from the simple to the complex , if you do more . we like .
and then you look at them , and i thought , well , i thought that long time until she was explaining to me , that was , you know , to think about it , you know , to think about it .
it &apos;s going to drive the other direction .
girl : there was a sphere and a <unk> because it &apos;s two entirely different <unk> , and if you fall them at the same time , you might fall .
but we couldn &apos;t train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and this is a <unk> . &quot;
in the end of the end , we changed ourselves as we have changed the world around us .
it &apos;s going to have incredible effects .
why do you do what they do ?
everybody would have the new version .
they are very much .
they &apos;re even going to get in those days .
i &apos;ll put back back into the sequence .
&quot; well , yeah , i said , &quot; strange , you know , you &apos;re going to ask .
you , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do again . &quot;
we looked at , and i was grateful , because she was so grateful , because she was just said , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s yes . &quot;
the goal of the project is just simple .
this is completely personalized medicine .
now the answer is a <unk> team .
i &apos;m working with the <unk> and the <unk> , which is a few serious problems that we have the project , the problems that shouldn &apos;t have to be .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want change , not quite not , if an <unk> engineer , the answer is .
you can really find novel solutions that didn &apos;t have been seen , and that &apos;s just easy .
yeah , all my guys , my life , because <unk> was a round of beautiful shape .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t stabilize , neat cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth , &quot; i got a lot of the meeting with the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of the planet on this planet as they &apos;ve been here before we &apos;ve been the second of the microbial age .
its impact is the distribution of this very thin <unk> over the planet , and we had a very <unk> of the dinosaurs , the death of this beautiful <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
it &apos;s the top of the <unk> , the t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t. t.
they hate us animals .
that &apos;s when material comes from the depths of the earth and the surface is spread over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m <unk> off the coast of the coast , what will happen to me ?
they have an accident . you have two options : you &apos;re going to die , or you take the hydrogen , and we say 75 percent of them will be rescued , mentally .
<unk> : blessing and curse .
some of you are countries who think that deregulation or even no regulation is the best way to promote , to promote trade .
the answer is simple : the chinese are define these factories as chemical operations , not as <unk> , and don &apos;t check it .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office to develop all the way to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now , we have the idea that it &apos;s a way of a new way of doing the <unk> of the international tasks .
human rights are going to be a very simple question : can i give this to back back ?
or the boys who have to find the boy , the beginning of the time , to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? let &apos;s go .
i was the fire and it .
again , again , we saw how spoken word poetry poetry .
after the struggle , he shook his <unk> , <unk> hair and said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &quot; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot of time when i teach , and i don &apos;t get to see how my students reach your third step , but i had lucky to see that your journey was so eager , how did it .
my parents have me called me , &quot; what a <unk> name is .
i want to talk to you about some ideas that are driven by being a <unk> .
when i saw that the war in any of the world was such incredibly extensive consequences , and that the fact that the <unk> was actually meant to be a factor in the <unk> , i wanted to be a photographer to be a <unk> .
at the same time , in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released , the black population was the last phase of liberation .
the next day i was preparing to rwanda , and it was like i was in the <unk> in the <unk> .
after the fall of <unk> in indonesia , i began to study the conditions of poverty in a country that was the <unk> .
a hospital of &quot; doctors without borders , &quot; in a refugee camp .
the <unk> is so efficient that the fraction of the soldiers who survive a <unk> , in this war much higher than in any other in our history .
to make sure that as little as possible , can walk wrong , we have all this <unk> of the election .
so you &apos;re going to choose to it .
but this is a general and very difficult subject , so i had to have a .
the size of the population -- here &apos;s large china , here &apos;s big india .
and in all east religions , but japan was the same thing .
because the death of a child is going to be a child with a more child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great <unk> .
all religions in the world are able to maintain their values and adapt to this new world .
and then , like all the other of our generation , we lived in a <unk> .
eight .
in india alone , my <unk> best friends and i was at the door with this same image to every single house in india . we did a billion .
this is the <unk> .
i asked them -- they &apos;re all <unk> -- and i asked them the questions that you would like to ask them .
i think we owe the death and ron st. john , i hope , ron is in the audience -- -- he &apos;s the founders of gphin .
larry brilliant : first , aren &apos;t you angry because of the <unk> of the copyright ?
a <unk> , , &quot; the climate group .
why should we have a positive influence on earth , in the world than a company ?
they save 85 percent power with an led which they would have used to be an old bulb bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent are pretty difficult to be , and we had this conversation in the company .
a <unk> <unk> pays himself in seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 <unk> in a very vacuum model , 8,000 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough , and we want to close this gap and we want to close this gap and to go to the high management .
there was an equation in my family , so if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not spiritual .
this is , &quot; he wrote , &quot; is the form structure of the reality . &quot;
anyone who thinks , or your point of view , it &apos;s a way to turn back into the ears or your mind .
and the end of our <unk> , we realized the openness of the other .
and i &apos;m often coming back to bangalore and often often <unk> <unk> and often to <unk> a different subjects , as they were talking about new <unk> , where a drink is often costs than what they &apos;ve paid for their 14 year-old .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness and says that he wants to improve the life of his child child .
this <unk> seemed pretty happy to be , and it had no deaths from no deaths , even though already dozens of <unk> were killed in liberia .
and how are we responsible for ?
it &apos;s troubling -- not ? -- that the media &apos;s the world is doing a bad job , that a little group of activists in the situation is to publish more from this kind of information than the rest of the <unk> .
j yeah . this was the title page in the guardian , and it was then in all the countries around kenya , in the <unk> and south african press .
j the effects of the people who worked on this was considerably considerably .
and there are lots of information .
i would just care about just because of what we &apos;ve heard about -- i &apos;m curious to the opinion of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , do you tell us more .
so you have to be careful about this term hacker .
and just a month , this was passed into the <unk> parliament .
and from all those numbers , i &apos;m just going to start with two or three variables .
this piece of this piece of this piece of being able to read , depending on where you &apos;re <unk> .
first , i read about this in a <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> for <unk> medicine and seven <unk> .
so , according to that , the best <unk> for a chicken is not going to be in order to make it , but certainly not to go black , and a <unk> spider bag , <unk> sugar or <unk> .
and then in the next summer , i was working on the board of dr. <unk> at fort <unk> at fort <unk> , texas .
and this realization is to be tremendously for efficiency chemotherapy , maybe for many different types of cancer .
for example , there are <unk> organic pollutants that are in our schools , care and in the workplace .
because all those solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable , and they &apos;re <unk> -- <unk> for our generation and for the next generations .
and immediately called a voice , &quot; aha ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me and women .
difficult !
a prosthetic is not more for the need , lack of active .
we are all different different perspectives .
i was in the way of the olympic games in the way .
about 80 percent of these <unk> are young people , are young people .
and they are most unemployment , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the banks , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of europe and america of the products they produce .
they have a kind of a type that you can get on a piece of a piece of fish , and it looks like cattle .
people think of questions about questions : will we continue to continue to spend a higher gdp ?
there &apos;s nothing up there , but the conditions were ideal for the <unk> .
now , the software series didn &apos;t even have been , so you are the first one that can see this .
mars is more than the earth , it seems to be as being as <unk> .
sousa was afraid that we &apos;re the way of this , quote , &quot; <unk> , &quot; you would take it .
but much more important was that , in general , , that , in general , use of the work , to generate new <unk> , they &apos;re going to be <unk> to their clients , and then in 1940 , as a <unk> with a <unk> of fees , the majority of the <unk> .
and i ...
for the <unk> , for me , i &apos;m trying to ask as a good leader , of course , to ask a little bit of the government , a mistake , right ?
this is a realization of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
okay , i don &apos;t want to alert anybody here , but i &apos;m just stunned that the person on the right next to you are a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t look like , no . &quot;
but a different study showed that foreign even one time in the first 10 minutes of their own .
here is koko with her pet .
i &apos;ll say it again .
not a liar don &apos;t look into the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , as we &apos;re shaking the head .
science has a lot more of the <unk> of the <unk> .
look at the right and you &apos;ll see the <unk> smile .
in this way , much more <unk> world can be good for us to be a little bit more comfortable in terms of our moral set of rules .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we think that language the world that we live in , but that &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s when you have a <unk> joke , if not tragic joke about harry , <unk> than a ethnic <unk> .

a new song , i was able to get you a .
so i took a moment to study at coke .
and in the remote mountains of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good street .
how do you expect to be incentive based on the impact that you &apos;re doing on these remote villages ?
i don &apos;t have a <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
they wait to be cut .
a lot more people would have been reinfected .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things , first of what we &apos;ve lost , and secondly , how we &apos;re going to .
here you can see the biggest part of the <unk> of the <unk> of the florida .
if there &apos;s no fisheries in a coral reef , because it &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> , then it &apos;s great .
after a few years after five to seven years , the fish are going back , eat the sea urchin , and then the algae happens again .
you can see the boundary of the <unk> , because there are the boats there all the <unk> .
if it &apos;s good , if that &apos;s so simple , how much it is ?
so the protection of the <unk> and the oceans has become a <unk> for governments and <unk> institutions , and that &apos;s not <unk> .
in the coral reefs , we found out that the pyramid is the equivalent to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .

bl : these worms have no <unk> . they don &apos;t have a mouths .
what we &apos;ve seen was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in the <unk> .
these worms grow up at a week !
the concept of the <unk> is futile .
and the rest of one percent look for the formula that you can apply in the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so on .
the students have to do this , they have to make it .
and the best thing , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer to the end of the <unk> .
what is the small hadron collider ?
here you find the fastest growing of the world &apos;s fastest population .
it &apos;s <unk> . there &apos;s no national schools in the slums .
this is a computer that the entrance to the entrance to the <unk> of a <unk> entrepreneur named <unk> , who showed that kids were able to learn that kids were able to learn from the <unk> .

there are formal framework , schools , <unk> , hospitals , where innovation can take place , and informal environments , communities , social networks .
every child , to age 15 , which is a place in a school , will be able to get in the situation .
and as i look at it , this scene that blew me down to tears , and i &apos;ve been doing it for 25 years .
here are some of the parents of teenagers ? we &apos;ve got to cook for them -- and they &apos;re going to eat every night for two , three or four . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he goes on and eat everything !
these gay people , people like me , are being treated as full citizens , and it &apos;s been just before our nose .
there &apos;s people who have a fear of their jobs , so they don &apos;t show who they are really , here at home , and it &apos;s not just the north carolina , in all the states , it &apos;s legal .
think about it .
and i &apos;m afraid .
so , about three years ago , i read an article in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us to be able to be able to be .
that &apos;s how evolution works .
and indeed , here &apos;s this one .
i &apos;d like a little bit of someone .
it &apos;s not only 43 to 44 degrees fahrenheit for about two days , but keeping a constant temperature .
but the contrast is going to be in something like this . they &apos;re <unk> before the background .
here , americans suggested the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started telling me about it , and all the parents here are the <unk> .
i have a <unk> history .
our lives are determined by data , and the presentation of this data is an opportunity to create a fantastic interfaces that can tell great stories .
i also thrown a look at the various <unk> , because you can select what you &apos;re going to highlight from the data .
it &apos;s a <unk> man who sits in the box and controlled this <unk> .
a <unk> of about 11 sheep per hour , which is a <unk> of $ 2,000 cents .
so , in the bottom , you can see what you see on the left is the <unk> , and on the right side , you see the <unk> of the <unk> of 16 people who have no idea what they do .
digital bell : digital , digital ... aaron <unk> : and we took all of these pieces and put it into a new set of <unk> .
but we knew that we had the right person to make us behind the point of ourselves and we could build something .
and underneath underneath all the individuals who have submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i made pictures of pictures , cut , and put them in <unk> .
a <unk> consequence of this is that you can always see a part of the image , and it leads to a very free structure .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , like the earthquake in haiti 2010 .
then i went 50 miles , then 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers of which we &apos;re made , and what we &apos;re presenting to our identity as our identity .
another <unk> is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it &apos;s perhaps easier than ever before ever before , to make a good job .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly <unk> .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called &quot; unhappy &quot; -- &quot; someone who was lucky , the fate , the fate , the fate , not <unk> .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s going to do with the most recent court with angels and <unk> , and the sky will open up .
i told them the act of madame <unk> .
what i &apos;m talking about , really , is success and failure .
we should make sure that we are our are , we are really the creator of our own .

if you train for those exercise , they don &apos;t smile .

they &apos;re in the fluid .
my breath is down three <unk> minute .
and that should worry about me , i didn &apos;t make it .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only <unk> that i &apos;m interested in .
that &apos;s already today .
the <unk> can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly <unk> of <unk> , how many of these things are special about this stuff , because they &apos;re not so good .
many of you have the owners to get the owners to the owners .
this is a important part of our life . we &apos;re going to sleep a third of our lives .
ok . so let &apos;s go from the sleep to go .
so we can change medicine in the <unk> , in all ages , by <unk> or <unk> kids to the senior , the <unk> arena , the entire spectrum of disease -- i hope i &apos;m a feeling of it -- around the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;m convinced you that -- the implications of the <unk> are enormous and the effects of disease are equally powerful in all those different diseases and more .
how do we create robust societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a particular called <unk> , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and destroys the whole system .
and so there &apos;s no <unk> .
and she &apos;s a great thing .
steam should be a faster .
maybe you wonder how we do these <unk> .
so , our is the only cookbook of the world , in the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgery is always a lecture about surgery surgery .
and surgeons were more people more people who were doctors .
but ultimately , the one one is .
they had to give up their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i &apos;ve got to tell you about the big , complicated robot .
and as you can see how it comes out to do something useful , it can &apos;t stay so <unk> .
and we don &apos;t have to have a <unk> , and we don &apos;t have to do .
we are here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , now , it was partly my fault .
we have not only showed that bacteria can be able to make the solution to plastic waste , but also that openness to <unk> <unk> and taking place to risks and take risks of risks .
the film that we &apos;re going to see , they made for the <unk> of the <unk> in new york .
i &apos;m not exceptions there .
it went on . they always always tried to make things .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house . &quot;
i think in my family , we had very lucky , because we &apos;ve learned to design .
fall , very good !
ed : and then <unk> row , and then <unk> row is a historic <unk> , and in the <unk> history of the <unk> history in the <unk> history of the <unk> , where the message was in .
see this chair ? the orange one ? that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
because it &apos;s part of what we want to be .
it was <unk> <unk> of outrage . they were full of speculation . they were <unk> , no robust information .
one of them is familiar : the population explosion . the world population has moved from two to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
<unk> <unk> : being here .
you can see the lines of the lines when the population explosion is happening .
before i talk about the cost , i have to realize that that is that that &apos;s .
this is what liberation actually .
but only for the last time we can , thanks to a , thanks to a , so we can now demonstrate the <unk> and quantum locking .
first , some strands of magnetic field are stuck inside of magnetic field of magnetic field , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it , if they &apos;re moving , because your movements , the energy , and so the <unk> .
and i can also expand these magnets , of course , to form a random rail .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams , the situation is from by hitchhiking .
because , of course , they &apos;re not explaining how to do it , if you want to do it yourself , and not a <unk> .
but although they didn &apos;t believe , they said , &quot; okay , we &apos;re going back . &quot;
<unk> : yeah , i have .
so some will say , &quot; what will happen if moore &apos;s law ? &quot;
today , you can buy half a billion , and they &apos;re better because they &apos;re faster .
but how do we get the software ?
larry page has been a passionate about our <unk> , in which he <unk> the big challenges of mankind .
they wanted to catch the fish .
it may sound insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly terrifying to hear the most rumors of being able to hear that one more <unk> than the last one , or maybe ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a kind of <unk> moment , a moment where the blogosphere was actually been growing up .
probably it &apos;s probably been in three to five percent of the <unk> of jellybeans in the jar and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody &apos;s got something to link , so , you know , others , etc .
he ended up his <unk> , and i wait up to a $ 300 pounds of paper with us , but he &apos;s just saying , &quot; that &apos;s what i want to do . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to end up with a second , a second , a second , a half seconds of the thing .
this is the habitat of the surface of the surface of the world &apos;s surface than all the other habitats habitats .
many of us , i &apos;m an unlikely to think that the world &apos;s <unk> oceans are really getting serious in the last 50 or maybe 100 years .
and those of the wire associated with a cable , our eyes are our eyes and hands on the bottom of the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a barcode on this product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
but i want to share some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do this , we don &apos;t know .
this graph based on a brand new article that &apos;s going on in the journal of biology .
but that &apos;s not all that .
as an architect , i have this one .
mitchell <unk> : don &apos;t build a house , they &apos;re going to be !
i think that &apos;s very interesting and very <unk> , because what you heard about the last few days is the sense of the way of looking towards looking at different directions : directions that are specific and unique to the problems .
now , we all think that <unk> obviously was a vast modern poets , many of us , that he had a few wonderful <unk> , and the most famous feat is a &quot; for a responsibility for the poetry .
i &apos;ll read it .
and to a certain time of his life , they &apos;re sitting on rocks .
but let me show you the latest robotic .
if you used to be before the digital radio radio radio radio , the <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; on the <unk> , that was this noise .
the idea of the <unk> is <unk> is that you have two sources of information that the implications of the implications .
that means that i have to make predictions about the future .
now , there &apos;s a very clear example of where a <unk> of me is a very different example , when it was being made by a different person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person plays .
if those points of cars are on a <unk> , they would have no idea what &apos;s going on .
we have shown that we can explain a lot of data , and people are actually planning their movements to the negative consequences of the noise .
this is from the <unk> of marine marine days .
mars has the largest <unk> of the solar system , the <unk> .
this is my <unk> . it was taken a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is just 3.6 billion .
and the result of our gang was a <unk> <unk> called ares .
we fold it , and we train it in a <unk> .
this is over <unk> , oregon .
i think that &apos;s the packaging packaging , let &apos;s look at this -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these guns for lego because lego -- no , they &apos;re not standing on either .
and then there are some examples of <unk> stuff , and they &apos;re real sculptures .
i have to tell you , for me , had changed this evening .
perhaps most important , the influence on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is leading .
in brazil , there are <unk> <unk> , whereas america have just 700 , and <unk> two in california , and within three years , the fraction of <unk> is up to <unk> percent .
it &apos;s not <unk> . so irrational is a really big thing .
scientists explain us -- and those are just assumptions -- that we have to be cut down the 0.2 rate of greenhouse gases and that &apos;s possible as soon as possible .
i can &apos;t wait to expect what we &apos;re going to think of the crisis .
there are fewer people who are available , and then you get to get rid of this , and then you get this <unk> of the curve , and you get this classic <unk> curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and this happens to each nodes .
the red dots will be the <unk> , and the yellow dots are friends are friends .
would you get rid of the time ?
and there are , i think , three ways of that <unk> data can be used .
the building was in construction until collapse of the <unk> economy and the death of the world &apos;s disease in the mid- &apos; 90s .
although it seems to be a totally chaotic place , if you see it from the top up , it &apos;s apparently a whole net of <unk> and channels that connect every single house .
in this tradition , the future bride are all the their possessions that they &apos;re going to get their new husband .
what a place like the <unk> david is particularly remarkable , this kind of <unk> , where people have a foundation that they can do to use .
we can just say , &quot; how are the <unk> of the <unk> ? &quot; and you know , or what we want to ask .
it has replaces the workers with technology .
you can see the links in the screen , and you can see the symbols that show what is the right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older .
or even if we &apos;re going to be much older to drive our cars , we can visit people .
they were gone on a moment .
it &apos;s always more apparent that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me the outcome of the screen .
one of the journalists said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the <unk> are <unk> , like jewish <unk> .
i think there are some , actually , many reasons , but here are just a few of the reasons we &apos;re going to focus on .
he he <unk> dressed up , he hunt them , he was like a <unk> of light , a little bit of a <unk> .
let me go back door to door at the international community , and see if i &apos;m a <unk> or or a troops for those people .
but for sergio , it was too late .
he saw them .
<unk> power : a complicated hero
this is what jobs and possibilities all the way down the whole line .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the holistic of food , because it was this year , last year , last year , and 2008 , during the <unk> , enough food , for every <unk> pounds .
and i go into those shops , if you &apos;re there , or in the fields , to see what you can get , and i &apos;m sure , you cannot get food .
we see changes from the participation in schools .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of them instead of using subsidies and other things , invest in school school school school .
thank you .
we could do the same thing in cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a <unk> .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it shows me how many 15-hour cups i <unk> every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours of what i do .
it &apos;s never been .
the <unk> of these magnets magnets are so large that we can see a neutron with this technology a single neutron .
you have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is large enough , and your resolution , you can actually use all the proteins in the body and begin to understand the individual system .
most of us find that reassuring , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute , about the <unk> of a <unk> people .
so if i think this -- -- just a few seconds , they would feel uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and they would leave the room in .
they all have been recognized . and this is the melody that &apos;s at the most part in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
while we &apos;re crossing miles and miles of <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> .
as i &apos;m standing here today , i &apos;m talking about the <unk> of about five years .
close 10 miles off the coast and down to <unk> feet .
the ocean is climate and weather , they hold the temperature of the stable and form of the chemistry of the world .
<unk> are easy to be there .
this is the result , if you don &apos;t know that there are borders of what we &apos;re able to use the oceans .
in the past three years , the united states , for example , the united states , for example , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we need <unk> , new technologies to explore the ocean .
most of my early career i wanted to find out how the wings of insects are the power of insects to keep in the air .
so let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual <unk> of a mouse &apos;s lab by jeff <unk> , you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re a <unk> to make any behavior , another <unk> , a different color and patterns , and you can think that this in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and <unk> computer model of the human brain model .
he &apos;s home and drinking tea .
if you &apos;re looking at the surface of the neocortex , you can see it &apos;s made of louder components , like in a computer .
how many per tree is there ? where are you ?
we can look at the tissue , and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , it &apos;s actually activate , and watch what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the secrets of the brain can be solved . mental illness , memory , perceptions , they &apos;re from neurons and electrical signals , and he does it with a supercomputer that &apos;s in the brain with <unk> synapses to find the brain with <unk> synapses .
it would be two or three thousand bombs of bombs .
the air force started to build smaller models , and began this .
so , what nasa did was to get a <unk> that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about <unk> behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because it &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people that question , they think that it has something to do with the culture .
the country on the right , the people who are very much , they have a very lightweight form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but it &apos;s going back to the end , it &apos;ll be more complex .
a online <unk> for imperial dollars .
the the general idea here , by the way , is that we don &apos;t really know our <unk> &apos;s really good .
in fact , in medical terms , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared infrared -- you can only use the <unk> of the eyes .
their intensity can be <unk> and it can be turned off very quickly .
they are critical .
but that &apos;s just by the way .
cars have <unk> and <unk> and can communicate with each other and through the <unk> traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic , and so on .
dna is what &apos;s mean is mean .
it &apos;s actually not that many data .
you have the <unk> genome , and it does a customized medicine that is better than the present today -- it has no side effects .
it &apos;s really easy -- only <unk> genes -- but we could completely embraced it .
we &apos;re not running as little organisms in the world , but part of a large ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we &apos;re poison or earth -- but this is just the consequence of us .
now , i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of dig in the moment of dog dog &apos;s dog in the moment of one of the people who think you &apos;re a dog , first of the , , first of the rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; <unk> , &quot; just to beating , and that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to get .
no , we &apos;re doing &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- boom , he can try to 10 .
they &apos;re like golden <unk> .
and i would say if you didn &apos;t have it , then maybe maybe maybe you couldn &apos;t .
not just with the puppy , but with the rest of the family .
these are just so simple .
their kids are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think of the energy .
because even though i use scientific concepts in songs , it &apos;s very hard to make them sound sound .
and even rarer , if it &apos;s <unk> , and <unk> , the way in my case .
one is a white light of light .
64 with 75 <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert is a mile or two a year .
the homo erectus made the same tool about the other other generations .
you can teach them in the lab , a little bit of <unk> , and there &apos;s also a <unk> in other animals , but the exchange of an object never never happened .
it &apos;s the wealth of wealth , in the joy of your own needs to save time .
we have been achieved as a species .
but there is no evidence for that .
and when people began to start by putting objects like this very , , was that a hint of a hint of a <unk> between groups .
but who knows how to make a mouse mouse ?
but i &apos;m also about the interconnections of the connection , the people , and the way that we never have the opportunity to meet and mating and mate . i &apos;m also sure that the technology continued to be more and so much more .
this is as much as a <unk> building . i &apos;ve got the statue of the statue of the <unk> .
we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , those feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , then the rapid development problem is the problem , because how can we detect things that are constantly changing ?
i &apos;ve talked about -- you know this situation when you &apos;re not diagnosed in the hospital ?
what about the real people ?
we &apos;re a part of your viruses ; they &apos;re new , far more <unk> .
after 10 days , she came back with a fever of a head -- still a fever -- she has <unk> -- little oxygen in your lungs .
it didn &apos;t even sequence it .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely <unk> . nobody ever seen it before .
a huge battery could be .
so , instead we &apos;re doing something that fits the <unk> of the <unk> .
i got a low low low up with low density , a <unk> with a <unk> down , and a molten salt in between .
but david is young and clever and he wants to be a <unk> , and he &apos;s building -- he &apos;s going to build the very first metal tissue with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of all that ?
this is taken in the <unk> of the <unk> , six miles outside the coast of <unk> <unk> , about 20 meters below the surface .
and quick , we realized that our garage was not large enough for this growing project .
i started to find myself , and her methods , and how it was that , and how important she thought that kids are going to detect and they didn &apos;t teach them , in an open way .
evolution is often as a way that we chose , but it &apos;s actually a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the stage of space .
our cities are endangered , because many of you are the coast of them .
there are stars and whatnot .
so if we think about <unk> behavior or language language , as it &apos;s like the social revolution , it turns out to be , and we think about communication .
this expression , as proud of the , was studied by jessica tracy . she showed that people and from birth to blind people , they do this when they win in a <unk> .
so i thought about it . you &apos;re the people and see how they participate , and you could get them to be able to do it , and then you participate more involved ?
what happens in a <unk> game , what happens when you &apos;re at the <unk> stage , like the following little manipulation , these tiny <unk> ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes . where can you really apply it ? that was important to us .
those things . people are actually showing you , i &apos;m the right thing to do .
she was completely <unk> and said , &quot; i have nothing to look for here . &quot;
they need your body , privacy and two minutes . it can influence the other life in the great deal .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to get to your <unk> , and <unk> <unk> an ant crawling , crawling your inside , and drive a blade of grass .
and you have to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i &apos;m important to me that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course they are essentially extinct .
but below all those ideas that are facing our technology to be spreading all over the world , are many toxic ideas .
and how to viruses , we should not try to destroy them .
and in my game , you know , you &apos;re <unk> .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went on tour .
i know , you &apos;ll say , &quot; t. is it not in the music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody &apos;s listening to each other . nobody &apos;s familiar with anybody else .
they &apos;re going to see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to tell that that should not happen , but we have to be better if it comes to the questions that you have to consider when you have to take in account at the consequences and the reactions .
they work in <unk> . they &apos;re the driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she deserves about two dollars a day , building a <unk> , and he explains that she &apos;s not married kids before doing these things .
finally , from desperation , they went and <unk> , wise woman .
it &apos;s not even novel .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you will be the best talk you ever meet your mind .
okay , the vast majority of us .
its message was basically , and the one of the , which is the movement of everything and the unity of everything , and its fundamental value was respect , kindness from kindness to strangers .
who &apos;s struggling when he goes ?
they have to start walking in israel and palestine , in <unk> , in turkey , in turkey .
and so , more and more <unk> , and it has been a moment , and they &apos;ve been a income to support their family .
just go to somebody else with a different culture , from another country , with a different country , which is kind of different and engage you in a conversation , listen to him .
i &apos;m starting to start where the story began , 1985 .
today , before you get <unk> , who had the opportunity to shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of this less famous living houses in which 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a functioning in the house .
21 percent of what we &apos;re fixing are consequences of <unk> , things that were actually going to be <unk> .
we did this . he got a <unk> .
we found out later that in this region , the main largest part of the disease and death is .
and one thing is in context with everything we did , the middle of the <unk> didn &apos;t say , &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not <unk> . it &apos;s the work of people , and it &apos;s the work of people , and it &apos;s the work of people , and it &apos;s the work of people , and it &apos;s the work of people , and it &apos;s the work of people , and it &apos;s the work of people , and it &apos;s the work of people , and it &apos;s the work of people
i &apos;m not going to get to me if you &apos;re a <unk> , really not .
it sounds really <unk> to say that &apos;s the top of the up , but if you seek to use it , it &apos;s effective effective .
and with this statement , i &apos;m performing to you , in the belief that kids don &apos;t leave their community to live in a better life .
this is the youngest of <unk> workforce in america with our <unk> of the bronx .
this is a picture of mayor of the bronx who are kids in his house , not in the prison , so they felt <unk> .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re big kids with little <unk> , they &apos;re the big , thin man in the middle , which is cool , and they create this responsibility among <unk> , which is incredible .
now , you may be wondering about those kids .
hold kids from that shops .
steve ritz : a teacher who &apos;s the south bronx
second , i &apos;m betting that even you see here as a <unk> , you see , as a <unk> , you see here , a grain of the <unk> of the <unk> line .
so , 10 : <unk> , the pig seals , a heart attack .
people with a <unk> , the a <unk> , a band , with <unk> neurons -- here in red -- that three to five millimeters per minute , the <unk> .
the problem is that , 30 million americans have a <unk> , and we need a <unk> . i think we have now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> for the epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> -- an <unk> acronym -- for the treatment of other things .
lawyers take out of the <unk> in the hopes of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the poor patients full of pity .
a year ago , four of five of five of the <unk> of the <unk> of ushahidi , which is the way called &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; also , <unk> .
how do you know what it is really important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about the death . &quot;
i have the first time to get it here .
and this is the people underneath the barrier , because they &apos;re really going to be out of the process to share their knowledge of the world .
they have to use the progression as a platform to develop your <unk> and <unk> that in <unk> countries around the world to teach the teachings of the world .
yes , books , by maybe 100 or 1,000 expenditure in the year .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that it like all , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so , so , this is not very hard .
the days of the <unk> are over when people say , &quot; well we like to have three or more <unk> of our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use a few thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s something like an electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ $ 100 laptop , you can &apos;t do .
and this is the <unk> .
they click on things and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we all play &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a big assembly line , and we can &apos;t keep up with the .
thank you .
i think most people think that a mother mother , always , they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
it &apos;s not possible . this is not possible .
it &apos;s all good . they &apos;re going to live .
first , the <unk> , to prevent the <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better healthcare system ?
the <unk> is , as simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of the <unk> substance at the age of four to 22 years , you take in the childhood , which is this graph , and it shows the <unk> in the early adolescence .
the idea that her dad was singing in the public , so she was <unk> .
this is the <unk> that we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the <unk> <unk> museum in austria to install it in its lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that there stayed up there 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but at night , as we <unk> , i asked the <unk> , like the <unk> , would have decided that sam <unk> would kiss .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working on four generations in the <unk> .
honestly : i have no idea what it &apos;s <unk> with <unk> , but they &apos;re immensely <unk> .
the first thing you realize in the <unk> is the horrible force of the <unk> .
he just crawling it around my leg , i put it up again , bringing me up to a car and i can bring me to a doctor .
it was a <unk> in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about you . &quot;
we calculated that 200 years of the end of our own , the end of our own , the end of our own .
it &apos;s just as easy as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect <unk> like technology .
she &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i would like to think -- thank you .
and i can tell you , corn is in everything else .
you should know that in every community , the number of the <unk> are already rising .
i &apos;ve done three <unk> in antarctica .
but what i &apos;m saying where you are , and to what country they belong to . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> for birds , one of the most important in the pacific .
and we are facing the rest of the world , a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
of course , the <unk> and the open seas , but the <unk> , everybody wants to look at , was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with large <unk> and large <unk> .
now , there &apos;s <unk> , ahmadinejad , automatic <unk> for free to a lot of our devices , even on the screen .
it &apos;s a endless argument , and there are no conclusions , no answer , but if you &apos;re a geek , you say , &quot; well , what do you say ? &quot;
instead , he carefully documented that what happens again when technology for the first time in a community , and in a community .
so there are , of course , there are two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves <unk> paintings .
i mean , it was at least the way it did me .
now , there was a question that i was in head for a while , &quot; well , i can do more of the things that i like to do in the design , and less of those who i like to do not like that ?
and here it is on the front of it .
they &apos;re a horrible situation without a way of a <unk> .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
as a <unk> , for example , i was interested in the <unk> of the <unk> , because i knew the <unk> , and i know how i have to use <unk> , and i can do it quickly with the <unk> .
i have that value of the elderly in so many of my friends , which in their 60s , &apos; 70s and 90s still active than <unk> , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
as a christian change , and made of <unk> <unk> , made young people in the united states and canada and <unk> , which also , and he had violated back to the bible .
the case of <unk> , the last muslim of europe .
the biggest bad man , <unk> , don &apos;t want those rocks to go to the <unk> , so he tries to prevent them at the <unk> .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and when does the article out ? &quot;
<unk> : there &apos;s something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; .
it &apos;s dangerous , if a group itself is extremely identified .
<unk> <unk> : from islam
let &apos;s look at it .
so let me highlight it for you .
so let me show you this .
and when i began to designing with the designing , i &apos;ve discovered something curious about myself .
so they have the eye , and then the concepts come to .
but of course , china has a tremendous population .
but what it shows is is that this type of visualizing information is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure of them to do , because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is named after the the eden project .
why don &apos;t it smell like potato or <unk> ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows you to work a less .
now , for a few months of construction , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule called <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly what it does .
this is the basis for the device that these two people built ford .
they have made it -- and it &apos;s got to be like a coumarin .
that was a good thing .
at the time , a series of things are going on the way that i want to do .
and she actually had no idea of the context where she was landed on the place .
norman !
i said anybody to <unk> <unk> , neither of my mother , my sister , my sister , my brother , my cousins , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my grandparents , no .
i &apos;m swimming on it . i &apos;m doing it , just to say that i had two things when i left the orphanage , i wanted to do this , and the one was to find my family and the other one was to write poetry .
and this is how we &apos;re looking for them .
and then you hope that one of us have a walk and little parts .
he had a <unk> , and it has to be <unk> by others , female and probably a lot of smaller and <unk> , to get his age age 12 years .
is it a good evolutionary adaptation , or will lead to us the more form of the planet that &apos;s going on planet planet earth ?
but will we do this , or we will do it , we &apos;re going to take the way ?
one day , a few weeks , or maybe a year later , i was with my <unk> <unk> in a shop for <unk> -- we had a <unk> .
it meant a fundamental shift for me .
my hint : about 70 layers of this , <unk> <unk> .
do you know how obsessed i &apos;m really ? this project is just for me , and yet i went to ebay to a chinese paper in san francisco to buy the bird <unk> .
when we moved the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , was a perfect <unk> : sun , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever walk again , just with a <unk> . &quot;
i remember that my dad went to me in a wheelchair , and i was in the up to the bottom , and i was in the first time the sun on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;re going to lay you , because we think that &apos;s good for them . &quot;
she was the <unk> , and i called the school school , and i said that i wanted to take a <unk> <unk> .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i work in my work .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> of a richard serra .
how to hell , i do a phone in three weeks when i have been developing these things that are developed over millions of years ?
each of those elements could be stuck on the wall as a kind of <unk> .
in his days , he was the highest taxpayers in british .
i look at the individual and how they flow , and flow , it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the <unk> . it was used to cook with aluminum , and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you think it &apos;s a new way to contemporary architecture , it feels completely natural .
this is my studio . it &apos;s the road .
it was done by kevlar .
the same after i did my dr. dr. , i had lucky to be a member of a <unk> , which was the first time to explore the sea .
there was one of those <unk> .
he uses red bioluminescence like a <unk> <unk> , and you can see the animals that blind light can blind for the red light , and you can see them without being seen .
so they use it to eat and mate .
i challenge you to give you a different science that &apos;s still using hundreds of years .
this is a magical place .
so i made myself to rediscover the value of the <unk> .
and on june 5th , i heard a lovely bang on the wheel that changed my life and that was finished a duck .
and here are the duck .
and the way changed my life changed .
another example of the effects of <unk> on the lives of the birds .
so , if i like this , i mean , this is the clay for purple .
depending on how i got it , i can hear and make music and make it .
one of them is &quot; i have a <unk> martin king , and the other one is by hitler .
now , you can see , you can see that there are the <unk> <unk> now .
you don &apos;t want to say anything to say that could be used for a use . &quot;
absolutely critical .
and what happens if teachers want order to ask order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t trust the law , why don &apos;t trust the law ?
it &apos;s that freedom is a <unk> structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the largest change , we have to be the authority for the explanation of the <unk> and the officials .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise , they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
it &apos;s the frontiers of interest in the interest of the <unk> , and for those fees that they can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to do a <unk> column with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he had just a <unk> .
but the problem of being on rules and incentives , is that they &apos;re doing the most amazing activity , and they <unk> the most amazing things in things .
wise <unk> are not than anything , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any wise <unk> can be able to get for forever .
why does this idea spreads ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to zoom in the mentality now to be the , and the rest of the world -- they had .
this was <unk> , the turtle turtle .
we have this with a full <unk> of the .
what i want to show you is what they need to get to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
what would have if you had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and get the trucks that they just saw , somewhere in the <unk> .
part of the problem is that the <unk> itself , is the <unk> of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent me by somebody who is a <unk> of the <unk> , is the fact that it was difficult to be america .
there are many black sheep out there , the wrong things , and the problems are still .
we can show our results . we can do things better .
how can we tap into them ?
it &apos;s <unk> , a dangerous job working .
imagine we could , we could do it , because if we could do it , we could get more .
governments who are most progress , the governments are having found the way to make shared value , rather than the government to see the actor who are the bottom .
maybe i can take a look at the brain , and i can change my <unk> .
i want to zoom in .
come to me in the 19th century , right on june june .
we could certainly be so productive if facebook or twitter would not cost so much time .
they &apos;re <unk> <unk> on the british government , to get money for building the machines , because they believed that this machines would have tremendous practical impact for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t actually have a less wealthy men , but they also also <unk> to look at the <unk> , rather than to answer the <unk> questions .
i &apos;ll tell you how i learned about life .
if you start looking at the very little stuff -- this person has written a whole article , and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of those aren &apos;t old enough , they have no idea how this infection is happening -- which is this <unk> .
there are about 10,000 things in the way .
this would be the frequency of the <unk> in one by randomly chosen <unk> of the <unk> script in one by random chosen script .
wherever life is , you have this distribution , as opposed to this distribution .
hot to hot .
the cop says , &quot; are you sure ? hey , you know you have lost here ? &quot;
this is the data from one single district in zambia , from a few years ago , i have a <unk> .
as you can see , your head had a lot more hair at the time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars if i had time , or i had the time , or i was stuck in my plan , and i didn &apos;t have been on the holidays .
instead of teaching people how to put the paper on the cell phone , we should build a software that allows them to do the self , without practice and without my <unk> .
that &apos;s less than i earned for two weeks as a fisherman .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in the balloon , we have to change the height .
this can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why you need to have <unk> .
i promised me that i would like the next time i would fly around the world , not will going to be going to be independent , independent by the fossil <unk> to be sure not being threatened by the <unk> .
i think you need a pilot at the universities who can talk to students to speak to students with politicians during the flight , and it really can make a <unk> of a <unk> adventure .
and what is the goal ?
so that &apos;s why all people who believe in this sense of faith , are to be part of this team .
now you need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to create a moment , is what this problem is and what it is not .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
so let &apos;s stop for a second stop .
in fact , we &apos;re the first generation , and this extreme poverty in the eyes , you see the ocean , they &apos;re going to tell you , and i think it .
it &apos;s a way to nerves .
this year , a test for us , specifically for the leaders of the most powerful states that are beginning and the world &apos;s disease .
people are getting this slow .
and with this one campaign as our screen , my organization , data , and other groups , and other groups , the energy and the enthusiasm of hollywood to the <unk> of hollywood to the <unk> of the americas .
step step for step , a nurse , a teacher , a <unk> , and life will be rescued .
the idea that the internet that all of your life has changed , a country -- and a continent that has just so much to become so as a way to digital , let alone -- and i &apos;m going to tell me the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
now , your job is to recognize what these forms is kiki and which is .
now if you &apos;re not just <unk> , then this phrase , literally , false .
if we solve a problem or something new , we compare what we already know about what we already know about what is not about us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit into all those of those things .
pm : i don &apos;t think .
how are you going to handle it , but also with your <unk> ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
and this shows clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was too large .
this is a list of side effects : if you eat too much salt , like a <unk> and <unk> cheese , then you &apos;re probably going to end up in the intensive care .
but soon i showed symptoms for <unk> , and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i probably never see my home back again .
i sat there and i talked a little bit about the <unk> for the transplants and asked him what i needed to be a transplant , could let me prepare for me .
i was on a dozen machines that i thought life was .
thank you .
interestingly , one of those <unk> is also about 200 percent in america .
also , interesting is that the same companies that sell us 80 million pounds of atrazine , the <unk> , &quot; now the antidote to the , and the same company .
we also launched as a <unk> .
what would our kids say to us , if they got a child , i had a little bit of <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a little pink .
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , this connection .
here you see this accumulation of the <unk> <unk> near the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for every <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> cannot be <unk> , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse , which looks the foot of an elephant , and the largest part of them stays hidden .
they look from their <unk> and <unk> comes from all around us .
redwoods have a huge surface that &apos;s in the sky , because they tend to something called <unk> -- repetition .
<unk> are the redwood of the redwood stability , just like a cathedral , and help the tree , live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely <unk> to see that .
but for the same time , all the doors of the <unk> ridge and the walls are going to break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s first look at the <unk> of the <unk> .
how do these infected these infected computers ?
and you can do it to watch how we work -- how do work work -- and trying to find a way , the <unk> that we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see a <unk> , <unk> / d / <unk> , and if you open up this image image on your computer , then this program is downloaded and ran .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the hallmark of the mercedes-benz is the <unk> .
we have to make any way of making sure that all goes on , even though the computer is .
but i have nothing to do with that .
this person is joining with <unk> .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what does the future ?
and this forces disappear completely , no one of the puzzle .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and they would be <unk> , and to this kind of computations , because this would change things in two ways .
that means that we &apos;re seeing a copy self , if they &apos;re only using a part of the <unk> , that in slow motion , and a worse <unk> and <unk> .
and the happy pair of , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their <unk> and saw that their video was going to be spread like a <unk> .
thank you !
you &apos;re going to go to the distance .
this is what he taught him , he was five years since he was five years .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a leader like mau taught me how to browse .
what is it that drives you today ? not about 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re going to do , and it &apos;s going to happen ?
didn &apos;t know -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- -- it &apos;s -- you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t .
so , in that moment , awareness or unconsciously , right now where you &apos;re going to focus on something , you can make it meaning , and whatever it means , it makes sense .
you &apos;ve ever done , and you went to , &quot; i was . &quot;
to death , so , god in its infinite wisdom , gave us a more human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it by intimacy , by friendship , by <unk> , by <unk> in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through them because i &apos;m a bit of . the last element is feeling .
so , a man with family occupied , someone in new york that had died if he had been at the day , and this man who had been a terrorist , and it clearly said .
instead , i &apos;m interested in creating tools that a large number of people can tell their stories , people all over the world .
the color of the particles corresponds to the kind of feeling of feeling -- serendipity , past-positive have shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day of the computer . &quot;
and if i go over here , the list starts to walk , and there are thousands of feelings that were being gathered .
the 10 issues of the <unk> and circling the time capsule .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : revelation of our modern mythology .
we can click on this , and see this iconic picture of betty ford , like she was the <unk> of her husband &apos;s husband .
you can also look at quotes if you like to read a quotes to climate change .
so people feel clouds than something that is in the way .
in life . she has been <unk> , of course , tens of thousands of members of the earth .
you just need a step out to go outside , and to notice that , so banal , so banal is that everybody else &apos;s missing .
so , look up , admire the <unk> beauty , and you always think of the head of the head in the clouds .
they would have <unk> the 25,000 images that would have done this : &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> , and it was a huge machine .
these pictures come from an virtual autopsy .
here you can see how the knife is invaded .
it &apos;s a smaller , mechanical pen , which is very , very rapid <unk> .
now , this is a really interesting project .
so he does it .
so , very talented people .
i went to kids as often as possible to get the academic material to the world &apos;s disease .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> summary of everything we know about the core nature of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into the detail why we think the universe is so , but it &apos;s the math of mathematics and tries to explain physics that we know .
i &apos;m still doing a little bit of a career in my career , but i &apos;m going to do something .
in 2001 , i went to a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this is the one in the year of 2004 .
he &apos;s just recently completed the <unk> , and he was shot recently with someone that you all know .
each one is going to have a <unk> <unk> , but in different scientific disciplines .
i have my first computer as a teenager , and it was a really great device .
he explored the brain using mri and he says this is the most beautiful brain that he ever has .
so on the next few slides i &apos;ll tell you that a little bit .
now , what happens is smaller to enable that , and that &apos;s how our technology is much better .
our <unk> is behind this lens here .
i had a kind of gut that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call you the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
we can see in our galaxy as a matter of the other .
and that &apos;s a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff out there .
it &apos;s much more than than the other and the cloud will be ripped apart .
and i hope you at least i &apos;m comfortable at least convinced that we have a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york and see a few kids between stairs <unk> cars and fire fire .
for example , the people like the 11th of the century , which is the way .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the big &quot; what is the great &quot; what is , &quot; god , &quot; god , &quot; and the price .
through new and more powerful instruments , the age of the <unk> .
but a question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and feelings over time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new <unk> .
until year , 1945 , they took it to 100,000 a year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going to start .
wow , a volunteer , excellent !
but recently , my interest in my interest in thinking of a new perspective of view , because there &apos;s where this really can create a really cool place .
well , i think this is the most salient part of the phenomenon that we call &quot; innovation .
but the element of desire is the most important .
we get incredible talk to the incredible talk of you .
so let me introduce you to this point sam <unk> .
but even if you &apos;re the screen , you &apos;ll be <unk> much more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s going to be .
how <unk> global innovations are .
one : i have to be a service to the audience and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him instead of , instead of saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and that they &apos;re having fun to design your own , ultimate or <unk> tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give you the sugar , so a kind of <unk> , which we call the superpower .
these are the kind of testing , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
he thought he could reverse the waves . couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three major changes , and in the area , choices and <unk> where people have real power .
how do we do that ?
my <unk> , sharon <unk> , &quot; all over the world , more photos of their head in the world than from any other .
11 of 14 countries .
and second , <unk> teachers were <unk> and <unk> , as a <unk> , the tools , because they were in specific areas , they have a meaningful sense of a more comfortable in which a more meaningful sense .
so i wish all of a lovely weekend .
to read and write , it &apos;s getting easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now , you might ask , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
if you have such a <unk> world , this can lead to a <unk> that allows to be solved .
the kingdom says , his laws allow him to strangers or <unk> , which is an economic risk or a risk for health care or a risk for health care or a risk for health care or a risk for health care or the <unk> of the state .
these laws are a <unk> in the face of the science and and ignorance and a <unk> and a <unk> and a <unk> of traditions and a <unk> and <unk> .
why are you going to be pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 <unk> of people are people who inject drugs .
so that social workers , the condoms to <unk> <unk> <unk> , not even by the police , <unk> or randomly become locked up .
here were children born , people died there .
office office work are now obsolete .
they cleaned up the high line , the street , the river below the street , and you get from a end of the road to the other without crossing the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
also , jobs should be shared .
their liver is <unk> oil .
and they killed the 12,000 sharks at that time by they actually were just a <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> bay on achill island to achill island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is going to be the place of a shark , depending on the time , the sunset , the <unk> , the <unk> and depth .
so let &apos;s look at the <unk> of the things that are passed from the genes that are passed from the parents , we see that basking sharks , compared to the first trial , one about 10 less diversity than other .
so , <unk> , and found that the size of the owner is .
and what was okay . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the the gender before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists , whether it was a male or female .
so i decided to give myself the the merchants .
your body will be broken with <unk> , and they &apos;re determined to be used for any <unk> to make money -- people tell you a lot of those stories .
no business with no business with no .
my journalism may not fit in other continents or in other countries , in my part of africa , but it works . it &apos;s about corruption , questions immediately asks people to say , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was moved in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be as a <unk> <unk> .
and had those people ever met a victim of their <unk> ?
now , you can be in 29 states , in more than half of the country because of its sexuality , of its sexuality , of its sexuality .
at some point , i realized that my mission &quot; gay &quot; to &quot; gay &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#93; , because there was a million different different gay gay .
at least i hope it &apos;s harder to be harder , your human rights .
one : the world is , and it &apos;s always <unk> and evil , because of the , because of the , and evil , yang and yang are the <unk> .
and three , i had access to all 1,000 images that the soldiers did .
in three ways : the prevailing way is called the .
this is stanley <unk> , a jewish boy who came from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust happen , here ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when it happened something ? &quot;
stanley <unk> and i , by the way , they &apos;re both in the high school , at the james <unk> in the bronx .
here are the guards of power and anonymity .
<unk> of the other .
alexander <unk> says that the border between good and evil by the heart of one person .
and i hired the experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s an enigma that was really difficult in the .
we have a self .
but on my left , a <unk> , which is the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one <unk> , which is the body .
i promise that i &apos;m not going to tell you , except that it &apos;s to be <unk> .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory , thinking , imagination and language .
thank you . thank you for the -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m going to tell you this -- i &apos;m going to tell you , and i &apos;m <unk> to make me just ridiculous , because i think feminism has partly to the task , to admit the aesthetic , and beauty and fun and fun .
we don &apos;t want a heroine .
you have now able to tell , i didn &apos;t put it on fire .
she spoke about <unk> , she started <unk> , she organized organized , they &apos;re friends -- all of this daily acts of caring and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s this <unk> , which is the homo sapiens of the previous <unk> of the previous <unk> .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves that uses electrical activity in my brain , while i &apos;m going to do this .
we <unk> a lot of prototypes and products to the life that you can control with thoughts , like <unk> appliances , or a <unk> chair .
the headset is wirelessly connected to an ipad or a smartphone .
how to use your new awareness of their recovery , many of the <unk> and <unk> social <unk> turn around , people who are being a different way to be in the way , to see .
it understood the power of human history and that the value we &apos;re in people , change , <unk> and growing .
and said , &quot; how do you celebrate ? &quot;
my skill and my possibilities .
so , <unk> , and very unexpected , gave them .
this specialist didn &apos;t stopped looking at my eyes .
i went to a track of the i know .
and , quite slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t believe in me , not really , not , not , not all the <unk> of me , all the little <unk> in all of us .
i &apos;m . my whole thing i &apos;m .
what we have , is the same thing , the same activity , but in one of them feel great , and at the other , with just a little change in the posture , you feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s a different argument that has to take place , which is to be the amount of control that we have our tax money .
for <unk> percent of this money could have been installing the <unk> in the trains , which would not have the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the more and the more of the possibilities of the .
i &apos;m not asking the full priority of the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world is that the field of economics as a <unk> discipline is understood as a <unk> discipline of human psychology .
if the average would have been to 60 to 60 percent .
it will warn you that they &apos;re not himself , or they &apos;re not themselves , they &apos;re .
gee .
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i have a coin with head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our shell of the observable universe .
thank you .
with us , we had enough , actually , very powerful effects in children all over the world , and now people are all ages .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , great , powerful , that &apos;s going to live forever .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old and i &apos;m <unk> .
this is actually the score of the <unk> piece that he has completely composed in the way .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , do we do a <unk> .
there &apos;s the present place .
i have to write five pages on the day for paper , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last time machine machine , is something i &apos;ve been introduced by hal <unk> , which i &apos;m introduced from my creator in a previous project , bill <unk> .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not the people , because if one of the faces smile , , then the other face are <unk> .
so that &apos;s one of the reasons that much of what we &apos;re looking for western science , math and <unk> , actually , in the first few centuries of our <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
x is the unknown because it &apos;s not an <unk> .
so , not , if you talk to heart of mental illness , you probably have stories of <unk> , you know , <unk> , to be <unk> , shame and discrimination in almost hearing life .
a little bit more than a 30 years ago , the nations of the world in <unk> , and gave this research statement .
what about it ?
if you look at the level of the species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish .
and you look at this resource , you can see that almost 8,000 of this is actually subsidies .
this was in the early days of india , when india wanted to model his <unk> -- as a means to rebuild china , with his <unk> growth from eight , nine , 10 percent , and wondered why can &apos;t we do that ?
it won &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to trust the guts and the guts , and saying , &quot; we &apos;re calculating .
green carbon , the emissions from deforestation and agriculture , and growing up , and we &apos;re growing up 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what those things didn &apos;t mean , they didn &apos;t really , really -- in the way , in the way .
i liked these intellectual <unk> .
and he said he &apos;d essentially had the same relationship with his dad .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move the the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed all the <unk> , and the color color color , which this just fantastic <unk> <unk> .
many of these ideas were embedded in the produced trailer .
if you think about it , your kids to get to the tinkering school , they &apos;ll be <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let &apos;s play with your own conditions , and trust them , they &apos;re going to learn to you &apos;re going to learn how to learn from the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you want to throw a device , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all . this is a number of <unk> .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here my wife walking , four months after that , in aspen , and in the good condition .
how about a completely <unk> <unk> , not just sharing the parts ?
this is one of the <unk> <unk> that didn &apos;t have been shot .
and so , it came to <unk> europe &apos;s <unk> , first of thousands , then hundreds of thousands of thousands of and finally millions of a little sheet of a little sheet , which should bring a one out of the sky in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden interconnections .
when the edison , the bulb , it looked like this .
you have to be a bit smart , and although i don &apos;t have a <unk> , doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid today , and it &apos;s going to get away .
they literally have the door of the door .
if you listen to your listening listening , both ears are hearing .
we have the problem that the <unk> is <unk> .
thank you very much .
and i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
i recently created some pretty sophisticated <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i drew her own special card , and he wrote their name , she <unk> them and send them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re <unk> .
and i &apos;m convinced of it that it &apos;s <unk> , my valuable and limited lifespan on this earth is just about it .
in this mode , he tries to hold his position .
i thought i &apos;m a little bit of how nature creates .
we &apos;re going to think of future technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids , where they have a different charges .
and by a series of <unk> , you can be a a billion fishing , you can do something like that , like a battery , or a solar cell .
in this case you can see <unk> .
if you ask people the question : where do you go to the question , if you have something important to do ?
i &apos;ve been on my desk , i &apos;ve used my fancy computer .
what happens then -- sometimes you have those days to you on eight o &apos;clock morning or seven or when you woke up , and you say , &quot; gee , i don &apos;t really have a good job .
so in office , most of the <unk> and <unk> people people who actually get from the work , <unk> .
we all know that that &apos;s true . you would never see a <unk> meeting that by employees of employees .
and then managers and managers are the two main major problems in companies , particularly offices .
maybe two weeks , or every week , a week , the week , <unk> , who nobody can talk to .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to have seven years , and i don &apos;t know what the future is going to be .
but if you ask people to the three most important things that they &apos;re carrying in , regardless of what culture , which gender and whatever other people , keys , keys , and if you have one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very large , but we have to forget the tendency .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the <unk> , and then -- the owner of the ship takes 10 or 20 percent , and there &apos;s the rest of my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he has a appreciation of the values of <unk> .
at the same time , the spread of these mobile devices is we see an expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we later about that later .
what about we just talking about ?
dean ornish shares a new research research that shows how the <unk> of severe lifestyle can actually affect a human level , and he says that if we live healthier , and you can actually get to your brain cells .
until i tell you who said it .
in this context , we can &apos;t feel regret about many different things .
when i went home , after i went to my tattoo , i stayed at the night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s a fifth one .
i mean , even the bad answer to all of &quot; <unk> can let us go back for days .
and as i said , i &apos;m a <unk> .
i thought i would try to prepare at my ted wish , what i &apos;m trying to do , and how to what they &apos;re trying to do .
none of them . now , there are at least half a million active active .
and i felt that anybody in this whole world of the world &apos;s organization has to be thinking about the organization of the .
and so we did this to do that .
listen to : less than four tenth of one percent of one percent of one who were treated , they stopped the <unk> of their drugs or <unk> , in the way of their medicine or <unk> in the way of their treatment .
it &apos;s a very attempt and i think it &apos;s successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
if the <unk> is deployed , they generate 8,000 watts of electricity . day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with green school .
the women of the balinese cooking , and they use secrets that just know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who comes from , and it &apos;s the study .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and <unk> , and not <unk> . &quot;
then apple alex alex , the best voice i &apos;ve heard about .
there was a reason for this : that was me .
the <unk> is not natural .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s not .
at first time , the internet was a <unk> tool , and now it &apos;s something i &apos;m going to leave my real , daily life .
&quot; it &apos;s human , disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the test .
before i was an architect , and my grandmother said me , &quot; what are you alive ? &quot;
we were two more <unk> than one page , because the readers are true .
so what is the lesson behind it ?
but one day my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re not going to walk .
it &apos;s <unk> and horrible things that happened to me .
everybody lost the hope in my recovery .
so they went to their <unk> and they all collected their <unk> furniture -- they gave me pots and <unk> , <unk> , all .
you don &apos;t know how far away that street is , and you don &apos;t know if they walk straight , and you hear cars and get out of cars , and they had a terrible accident that you &apos;ve got able to get into this situation .
i thought that for some reason , the time , and only for family and friends were gone .
for example , understanding the understanding of the molecular structure .
he took me to the <unk> of <unk> .
can we say we would have discovered all the symmetries in the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it , because i have a little bit of a quick bar , right ?
if i &apos;m a magic train , and then you one , it &apos;s a third .
galois has a series of policies for the way of these tables , and interact with these tables .
so , one of the symmetry we call it <unk> .
instead of all the time , i want to know how many digits do the number . ok ?
i need your name last name . symmetrical objects have basically -- please welcome him to me .
one : worse diet , maybe shorter <unk> .
thomas edison has been very <unk> in a software company .
penicillin was discovered in 1928 , but even in 1940 , no commercial and pharmaceutical , are made of the <unk> of this .
it was the origin of the <unk> , which last year was his 50th birthday .
for me , the doctrine of unintended consequences is now going to do . we do the best thing .
it works with every computer and the browser , minus negative , minus , minus , minus , minus , minus , minus .
they don &apos;t need to be <unk> .
and therefore , a kind of information that i &apos;m going to do , my real desk .
so a means of it would be like a <unk> , so you get back to the traditional desktop . the things are on grid .
now i get the heart of the heart of the people and there &apos;s no borders .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s <unk> with the bite , and with a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re going to think that we &apos;re a bit rethink the role of contemporary math -- not just <unk> , but mathematics in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists on the street street and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flying , which you might have on amazon .
they &apos;re not <unk> ; that &apos;s culture .
you can actually , very much .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s so interesting .
here we go . all it . all right . all .
i want to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> , <unk> , so , with <unk> , a lot of life , but there &apos;s a excess mating of them .
the answer is to allow the car to get out of this side of the street .
warren buffet was suggested that , honestly , what does not work and make this to a year .
in fact , we see the most famous disease because of the in africa , in africa , people have been formed several things in the way that we have .
this is that the economy in those areas are <unk> , because it &apos;s just so much .
but that alone is not a <unk> .
not only it was her , she &apos;s getting weaker .
a teacher of the top quartile will be the performance of its class -- measured at <unk> -- per year .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to be a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and those free courses could not be available in the internet , but you can also make dvds all over the way that everybody can have access to a <unk> .
traditional vessels , like this cup , they need eight hours to 10 hours to the burning .
the sculptors of the <unk> richard serra is how he thought he was a young artist , he was a painter , he was living after his school school in florence .
if i look at these pictures , i &apos;m going to put the smoke back to my clothes at the night home to my family .
my parents were quite great . they said , &quot; we know that you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad for keeping us so powerful ?
this is the number of general in boston .
the pathologist is taking the sample , it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> under the microscope , and then the operating theater .
so in this case , a solution to combine with these <unk> molecules , together with a dye , shown here , in the <unk> of a cancer patient , can &apos;t be normal tissue to either separate .
with <unk> lymph nodes as part of our current <unk> , the surgeon , the surgeon , the lymph nodes , where cancer starts .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause paralysis , and pain .
if we &apos;re these two samples ...
we know that this is , and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of a thousand different <unk> of which we &apos;re learning .
it will affect the common circuits as the good ones that they want to fix .
and one in the summer in summer , we tried it , and it worked at the first time .
we have shown that already , one of those cells , that we can actually push the learning to learn .
and it goes . now .
i want to end with a story that we believe in , maybe maybe clinical clinical trial might be .
now you can see that the animal is actually able to get the walls and the little platform and can use your eyes again .
buildings are colonized in the air , the microbes that ripple through the window and <unk> over mechanical <unk> .
and if they &apos;re out , the air contains microbes that are associated with <unk> and <unk> .
obviously , i &apos;m a very much of a very strong person , as you can see , so i didn &apos;t worry about this thing to be in the same .
the same thing is true for the question that after 9 / 11 , the streets in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of those things i &apos;ve done is something called the google , basically , you just take a abstract term and looking for google , and then you look at the results of someone .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . i mean , , ok , interesting .
if you have the second hand , you can see it .
what was normal for us 40 years ago -- telling stories between the generations -- is now rare .
in the year , in 2007 , the film older than most of our members .
was the story of good ?
why do we see this , not the same passion as this ?
in california , they &apos;re sent to a <unk> , &quot; this product contains chemicals that are being seen from the state of cancer as being <unk> by cancer , <unk> and other . &quot;
so we might have a <unk> of the <unk> , which needs humility to be humility , and for my job as an architect , it &apos;s an accident that the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; architect &quot; since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember the answer , but it was like , &quot; the stone age didn &apos;t end because we &apos;ve stopped the stones . &quot;
and this can be fine for me , but we &apos;re putting in houston , and all the windows are closed , and with all the products that are obviously not been a vertical <unk> .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m certainly the most of you use it .
since then , we &apos;ve been the <unk> most frequently <unk> in a database that we &apos;re available in six weeks of the public .
now we have 160 pounds of severe <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the internet .
we started making cities and using a <unk> of buildings so that all of the people and places where they can stay back .
and this is the <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . don &apos;t let anybody tell that we knew that , because we didn &apos;t know it .
for example , you &apos;ll give that the <unk> of the <unk> of september in september of september 2008 , and then the other : google , facebook , facebook , facebook , facebook , <unk> , apple and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden was similar laws like the united states .
and whoever told you , he didn &apos;t have anything to hide , not long enough .
and their email were reading , and she talked about the <unk> and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right in privacy , there can &apos;t be real freedom , and therefore , no effective democracy . &quot;
a lot of people , if you see a fresh human brain , say , &quot; usually , it looks different when you &apos;re having a brain . &quot;
all those of these empty areas are the areas where the <unk> are going .
and the nature of a particular cell , to basically predict the <unk> , is by by the fact that 25,000 genes are on the table and the threshold they switched on .
now , experts are coming into play and make the fundamental <unk> .
we take this , but put it on a so-called <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their genomes and they &apos;re trying to find the <unk> , the <unk> are connected to the genes .
whether it depends from individual genetic background or their experience , we don &apos;t know .
we know how we can do poverty , we have to do more for it ?
so here are a few more questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , before , it was all the same .
and there were many experiments that all all the same outcome , so i &apos;m going to just talk about one .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it . and we need to steer the politics .
and maybe we start small , with things , where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re going to be .
in fact , it &apos;s more conceptual than scientific work and lack of data on the effects of the <unk> question to the question of how to do this , but <unk> esther <unk> <unk> , &quot; it &apos;s possible to help find out what the <unk> are helping , and what damage -- with help studies .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , in terms of the beginning .
and the legend that alexander is telling that alexander <unk> through these desert .
but you could say , &quot; you invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it would not move . &quot;
so we look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk this from perspective of the ted conference .
in tanzania , last week of the standard of <unk> <unk> was called .
if i had to ask you , &quot; what was the most popular power in 2005 ? &quot; would you think of egypt ?
because there &apos;s fascinating possibilities .
&quot; god is the journey that we &apos;re all going to be inspired to be inspired and to feel one of the universe that &apos;s going to celebrate life .
you put a switch -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought they thought .
i &apos;m going to walk that , so that you can kind of , and i &apos;m going to describe my answers , when i first saw that .
absolutely .
ok , you &apos;re going to raise your right hand .
kt : yes .
kt : no , no . i &apos;m just seeing the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
it &apos;s back again .
kb : how many people have it ?
so let you close your eyes , in five , four , three , one .
it &apos;s not until you want the pressure to get down , you &apos;re going to make a <unk> , so , but only if you want the pressure to get down .
do you want to try it ?
you &apos;re a certain feeling , and if you feel the sensation , i want to throw the <unk> of the <unk> .
there &apos;s one thing i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in <unk> .
kb : ok . do you think it &apos;s here , yes , right ?
first showing us , keith barry , like our brains can <unk> our body -- with a trick that &apos;s also working on the <unk> in some sort of <unk> , and then he shares the audience into some of the <unk> of the brain .
i &apos;m <unk> .
this is not for &quot; one of four . &quot; that &apos;s all four .
i witnessed that both religious people are obsessed with morality .
the <unk> is almost zero , if there &apos;s no stimulation to the <unk> .
and they get a message from the computer , &quot; one has been sending them a lot of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin in <unk> <unk> increases 80 percent .
i have only found the molecule .
he said , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
in experimental , we have given men testosterone .
that tells us that we invented this ritual invented with this new couple of emotional .
and it &apos;s very easy to engage a brain to the <unk> .
to go to the machine , you need a lot of lots of lots of people .
or should you not that ?
they were pretty <unk> : &quot; you have a device that only works on english , so we teach ourselves , so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument , by making a ridiculous statement .
it &apos;s absurd . but i had to follow the victorian beauty .
what will this tomorrow be ?
we need to go back this imbalance to be able to be .
i think , in this , is the focus on this .
i &apos;ve got incredible questions -- &quot; when did the world &apos;s beginning ? how do you end up ? &quot; -- to nine-year-old .
and only one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i have just lost the thread .
<unk> went to local <unk> in uttar pradesh and found out that he was going to be turned into the official <unk> .
so this is the field of <unk> .
<unk> is in the privileged layer that is able to pay multiple <unk> to numbers and several households , in fact .
after these four children , you see <unk> young sister who were going to follow their children , who were also killed their children .
and finally , it was a single one who sat for me and later his participation , so i had to <unk> him , so he had to be <unk> .
with 16 , the kids have to leave the orphanage , even though they often can &apos;t go anywhere else .
one of the interesting things , of course , the combination of the naked hand at the instrument and the technology , and of course , what he said about listening to our young people .
now my career could continue a little longer longer .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him , the sound is the sound of the <unk> .
or we do this , and believe that what &apos;s blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
and you punch and , but why can &apos;t i do that if i &apos;m a piece of music ?
in this <unk> <unk> , the dove evelyn evelyn <unk> , why listening to music , how much more than sound to the <unk> .
and it became so large , until the point where it was a <unk> last year at <unk> &apos;s thanksgiving , and rick <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; millions &quot; millions of people on television .
but this is not the interesting thing .
cp : you have lucky that it &apos;s not going to be in front of them .
peace and love were mentioned .

that &apos;s 10 times longer than the mammals needed to reach their size size , and to the <unk> of those habitats .

so that &apos;s what we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
listen to the focus on those <unk> where you failed , if you take four hours .
and at the <unk> , it was always about to interact with things , not with people -- certainly not security , and the people would help us to be robots as part of our daily lives .
cookie monster is very , very bad .
the <unk> was a <unk> of our group in which they used three three of three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , they can become such an active participant in life in a way that it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third option was a simple journal of paper and the pen , because this is the <unk> that you &apos;re normally using when you start a <unk> and <unk> .
another important idea is this idea of the <unk> <unk> of the character .
i have style , i watch , look really hard , because it doesn &apos;t look like it , but <unk> &apos;s n .
it &apos;s gone , not far . i &apos;m fire : &quot; bam ! &quot; the <unk> is going to be between two <unk> cars .
if he wrote to a <unk> , i was the door of the door .
i &apos;m going to film a number of photographs and film , but i do also <unk> , books and a little commercial , all the same concept .
so , from photography , this <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , which you don &apos;t want to have , you want to do .
how they are in the collective mind , we have no idea that we know that , and how it happens .
it &apos;s very commercially .
and then you turn the photograph that he shoots , and suddenly it &apos;s going to be quite serious and maybe less .
85 percent of the global <unk> of heart disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet , 90 percent of the means in the west .
just to do . look at the position of the island of the island .
but if you tell you , we &apos;re trying to do the same thing in the right place , they &apos;re all going .
it allows us to be the existence of the existence , and we can actually use the experience very clever .
now , prevention has to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s important .
and we start a <unk> program , so we can fix the local people that can repair the equipment .
in fact , a very large bandwidth , of very powerful -- the kid &apos;s not being language -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
and i love the film , like all my projects , and this is the <unk> in my mind .
now , what i was learned early , because i didn &apos;t get so <unk> , i &apos;m to sell my work and not myself .
one of the things are the sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment of a <unk> problem .
the the movie is called the <unk> .
i did <unk> during the program . i did things and i learned to do things like you did .

the fifth one i &apos;m standing on this coast , the <unk> <unk> looks outward , and i think , again , i &apos;ll make it all the way across the vast , dangerous wilderness .
but it went deeper : how much life is left ?
and then , our <unk> , that you really never tell me how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but honestly , all those who i had <unk> , just to make the <unk> of the <unk> , they were very different .
thank you very much and much fun at the conference .
and this is maybe the <unk> , he lost his self-worth .
he joins the army . the armed army gave him a gun .
so , what happens when a medium suddenly is a lot of new ideas in orbit ?
they had to synchronize , which was the other natural natural natural nature , otherwise , you couldn &apos;t have the right kind of argument .
but there was a programmer that decided that this was not the best way of work .
each of you can do changes , and you can do it <unk> , and you can work to work <unk> , even if you didn &apos;t know anything from the existence of each other .
this is called a &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing right here .
something that is happening to a culture is that they can make a new <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , now .
don &apos;t try to do what others do , to make a little bit better , because it doesn &apos;t get them very much .
and if you say that you can &apos;t , then don &apos;t listen , you don &apos;t listen .
six to nine months at the end of year .
but we &apos;ve got this rover of this rover before we put it in the -- or this one rover -- and made sure that it works .
so we released a spacecraft probe on the way to mars , it &apos;s called the phoenix , and this spacecraft , in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so you can see your watches .
and that would be bad .
we are , as we talk here , the next rover , we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you have the last time that these really really cool things are really cool .
there were two main <unk> that we were particularly interested in .
it &apos;s like the circle of the earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water would be frozen .
today i want to talk about how this exponential technologies are growing technologies .
so , let &apos;s look at how exponentially the health impacts health .

there are wireless <unk> .
and i think , many of these technologies will help us to be connected to our patients and us more time to focusing on the very important , human elements of medicine , which are going to be <unk> through this kind of technology .
the current trend in medicine is , but it &apos;s exponentially becoming smaller .
let &apos;s come to genomics , when 10 years ago , the first human <unk> were done , the cost costs about a billion dollars .
thanks to the way that i like me , or how me , or how much they <unk> their data on <unk> <unk> or google health , it &apos;s always more important , all of those possibilities in a <unk> way .
we used the cells out of the bone with heart attacks , we realized that we have a more effective and higher <unk> , the <unk> of their own <unk> cells to the heart attacks .
my poem is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
their cats , god knows how many , rolling on your <unk> , your <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .

jonathan klein : photos , the world changed the world
i had been reading a lot of books and <unk> and <unk> .
i i could see myself how i strapped the flag on the hive , well ... aah ... aah , a <unk> moment , and the music went to a <unk> .

we weren &apos;t stupid : we were in about five meters , a piece of plywood .
as a <unk> were new , i thought , why can &apos;t take the oldest <unk> , the <unk> rhythms , and you combine the latest technology ?
now , i think it works because scientists are connected by a <unk> of a ethics .
it &apos;s important to show something in the space , because it &apos;s important , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this overwhelming view of the space that was god .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation of it was the only possible explanation that it was kind of .
and you understand some of things as others , and therefore there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and and give it to the politics .
there &apos;s another tedsters that has been talking about two years ago , jonathan haidt , who are in three different levels of levels .

and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s much of the same thing to do with the identity of the living with the memory of the death of the dead .
but the <unk> and the <unk> of wealth is also the status of the deceased , and the one of the family &apos;s deceased .

so , this works really well and you can see patterns , and they can build forms , okay ?
you zoom in , there are only four dna of dna , and on you can see individual <unk> , they can attach to other building blocks .
we have a very <unk> computer program where little changes -- tiny , single mutations -- something that created a square of a size , and we make something much bigger .

my argument is basically , , well , <unk> always always been part of our lives .
and that &apos;s pretty new , and i think it &apos;s much worse -- this opportunity -- because of the developments in the information system , in <unk> , the weapons that are used as weapons , like biotech or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; <unk> is our <unk> , &quot; he has the people &apos;s <unk> , &quot; which was a very advanced <unk> .
we only have six countries , which is called the media , only about six countries .

a polar bear floating in the arctic , by paul <unk> .
but those so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; if all of parts can sit together , not only the incident , but my emotional connection comes to .
nick -- again with a automatic camera -- took thousands of photos of this .
sometimes you can tell a more profound story on the functional way .
we want to find solutions .
and then , everybody would come up and jump .
thank you .
what &apos;s even more important , because this is a <unk> process , which is to be able to capture three seconds : we can be a little in a time of less than one single afternoon in several different <unk> and <unk> .
emily : image metrics is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i ended up in this .
in the reserve , there are also a few beautiful primates .

a amazing fact is for <unk> , that in the first half of the 20th century , the average of life expectancy is up as soon as the second half of the 19th century .
this was the paper i wrote about 11 , and i got a <unk> .
i have some of the time that i thought , was the long time between five and 15 15 15 , that led to a sense of failure .
so , if i look at all of our time , i think , is because of this sense , or the <unk> of the things that i see in the world is basically seeing in the life .
so , what &apos;s a buddhist fisherman says , because they actually don &apos;t kill a living thing .
and they &apos;ll be more likely .
and i had to find what was the story .
how do we <unk> what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of the court ?
and you have to be in all possibilities , including those who i &apos;ve never been looking at before .
i hope you &apos;ll see it , if i &apos;m these examples of <unk> , because i &apos;m actually talking about anything that you could spend your time .
now , there &apos;s magazines about the water .
people are numbers the full prize for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they have nothing in common .
the corners of the <unk> , on the center , that &apos;s the big market .
these guys represent the <unk> <unk> of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be <unk> <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to be completely <unk> .
so what you have to do is figure out who cares .
nine months later , i was <unk> messages in tahrir square , and i was a picture that i saw in my <unk> .
thank you .
it tends to be the cultural heritage in us to look back and the past .
my first review for national geographic , i realized that you can &apos;t have environmental issues in a documentary that was meant to be able to be able to be able to do it .
these are the lion and tigers of the oceans .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m kind of obsessed with you -- i wanted to make a more positive story about sharks to talk about the need for the need to be .
after i left , i learned that this habitat habitat is <unk> to create a new way of building .
they also got to <unk> .
but when the fish came back and again , urchin <unk> and the population , the population grew up in the shallow water , the <unk> forests .
now , she lives in the jungle of <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> , your second son , by the way , the son of the second script i &apos;ve rescued , <unk> .
it was a biological desert .
then you can see the returns to measure what comes out .
so how do we break this closed circuit ?
and you need bacteria to bind the nitrogen , and without any of those microbes , there will not be any power .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can actually change the climate .
in madurai , it &apos;s the <unk> , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the way to protect the own system .
the <unk> <unk> , who a <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m going to show you one .
<unk> <unk> creates <unk> sculptures , beautiful works , which is blinking in the pattern of <unk> <unk> , and nine minutes he <unk> with his <unk> art -- also inspired by math and nature .
every city has its own design .
twenty-three years later , you asked us to come and this idea of <unk> .
this is the italian portal , the <unk> park , the japanese park , the japanese park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either , it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or something , but not in any case part of science .
people always say , the conscious mind is hard to define .
you cannot be hearing on the existence of your own consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and order to be conscious , we have to just find the right program .
we &apos;re always bringing the objectivity and subjectivity as the characteristics of the , and as the character of the demands .
... do you not find ?
but i meet people who do what they do , and they don &apos;t imagine , to make something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear a <unk> .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , it doesn &apos;t do .
i couldn &apos;t just get this thing to work , no matter how much i &apos;m going to do , no matter how much i do .
but we have to change from an industrial model to a <unk> , where every single school can flourish .
so erez and i wanted to find more about it .
the reason for this is that historical report has been digitized to be digitized .
there was a light on . she said , &quot; okay , so it &apos;s really serious .
she led a group of students in a protest in the streets of the streets .
i stood on , i sat down , and i &apos;m all here -- and i &apos;m here -- still paralyzed , but here .
and peace direct , you get the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the dictatorship to democracy , with <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s not such a <unk> thing .
in fact , chris <unk> and said , &quot; look , show you this photograph , you &apos;ll think you &apos;re one of these crazy modern artists , not much . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the spirit .
and the solutions that i &apos;m <unk> , is the largest emphasis in this massive <unk> of the earth , and the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
so i said , &quot; what would you put in the <unk> -- we call it <unk> where they are the impact , in the denominator -- call it <unk> , where you have the implications ? &quot;
and he was a strong <unk> on the marketplace that has increased our revenues and increased .
we literally won &apos;t .
but five days later , back to atlanta , i received an email from glenn thomas thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so , frankly , many of us are afraid of us that are in the industry that the industry is threatened by technology and possibly <unk> .
and we truly , we need somebody to give us a sense of what we have a experience with a sense of a piece of a piece of the gun ?
the arts , whatever you do , invite us every time you get to the way we &apos;re concerned about our relationship with <unk> and curiosity .
the three sisters of the <unk> <unk> with her passionate music , at tedwomen , they start with the <unk> and <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; by david <unk> . they &apos;ll play a <unk> , <unk> version of <unk> <unk> .
the manchester <unk> of <unk> is named after my neighborhood .
he does a bunch of money by making a bag of money from the <unk> of the specific furniture for the rich people .
we basically adopted the president of the american <unk> , which is the harvard of the <unk> of the <unk> , and we <unk> a <unk> for mothers in this <unk> in the middle of the inner city .
we have noticed that you have to give you flowers and and eat the sunlight and food and and and and and herbie &apos;s music , and you can &apos;t fix the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given from the world to come from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re able to do , with affection and the and and the and good music and self-confidence and good music and self-confidence and good music and self-confidence .
and it has worked pretty well .
and i &apos;ll allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and you should have to sell you , you have to sign a agreement that the money is used to help . &quot;
this is a space of nancy wilson , which was built their album in our school , and i had taken her back to the last christmas .
the brown building , is you look at you , and i &apos;ll tell you where i was making my biggest mistakes .
he came to me , and he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a great story .
and so he &apos;s got a group of people .
bill <unk> tells a calm and powerful history of the art of art , music and unusual alliances .
and the the transducer is then bringing the <unk> to the code to the brain , and the result is a <unk> that produces a normal carbon supply .
but there was the <unk> factor , the problem with the code , and how to make the cells , to make the normal reactions , and so that was our contributions .
they cover us with a invisible <unk> , the attacks of the environment , so we &apos;re going to stay healthy .
but if the bacteria grow and and so all of them have to get to participate in the way , to get these molecules up , then the number of the molecules outside the cell is proportional to the cell .
now we know that all bacteria can speak to each other .
this is just a photograph -- a <unk> of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly <unk> , which is that we &apos;re killing with antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they &apos;re making tasks that they never even could do , if they only were individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor for me to get to this conference .
or the first ones that come into the room .
but if we think of justice , aristotle says , what we need to think about is the actual nature of the existing activity and regulations that are worth them , and they &apos;re <unk> .
what do you have ?
charlie , what do you tell to warren ?
here it is how he <unk> it .
so aristotle has <unk> , <unk> , and the dire <unk> asked the same-sex marriage of same-sex marriage .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument
a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , <unk> don &apos;t have to tell us to the <unk> , which we &apos;re supposed to start with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity can make a decision for the future .
so if that &apos;s what does that mean for us ?
i &apos;m proposing that the speed of the will be going to be .
i &apos;m saying that &apos;s ridiculous .
we know that this threshold is because we don &apos;t get any <unk> , before we reach a <unk> age , and that &apos;s the damage because of the damage since we were born .
meaning , you have to do your homework to understand whether that &apos;s true .
audience : hi . i have heard about it somewhere in the last 20 years , the average of the average of the world has been over for 10 years .
not one of their media , that &apos;s what it was .
we don &apos;t care how we do our profit .
she <unk> into the center of <unk> and put it into the agenda .
but i can &apos;t be a <unk> , the <unk> , the argument i have learned from economists , epidemiologists and <unk> .
the <unk> is something creepy , and probably you know part of the <unk> .
fourteen americans die a day of asthma every day , three times like in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from <unk> .
he had obviously thought of humor .
politicians and <unk> are afraid of being <unk> as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
second , because we have been eradicated .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s try it .
there you find some of the amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;re going to go . &quot; and paid people to do it , every <unk> that they saw .
he may have thought he would have the <unk> baby , so maybe he needs a little help .
i said peter , if you could have a changed , and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
we &apos;re now trying to be with &quot; africa : the next chapter &quot; and that &apos;s a common , a comprehensive , <unk> , beautiful africans .
but most of all , you have to be productive in their life , and creating a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that can be done .
we can combine all that ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to crawl between the legs of these people , with my sister on my my sister to find a window .
you know , we have to use all the good use .
and i often don &apos;t see african employees among them .
now , the question is now how we can use from all of this good will that makes us ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective in a <unk> product , i took this case that we can study them , right , how we can study any other complex neurological process .
the way was deployed since the 90s to study very complex processes .
i want to try to show this for them .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here , games in the shift .
how do you have now assessment ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s in <unk> .
i want to say that math and statistics , that &apos;s the math of games and <unk> .
it &apos;s very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but keep the mind for the entire period of eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , can become your facial expressions and intuitively , to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they &apos;re very quick , and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so kids die .
another statement of esther , is that we &apos;re responding to a tragedy of tragedy , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s produced by the <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting substance .
we have all the street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in your <unk> , a very cheap , <unk> lasers .
audience : yes !
what &apos;s interesting is , although we have all the time , we never did it , the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant of <unk> house .
so , you see , you see , you see , actually , in a <unk> , which is actually formed from outside , and it &apos;s been <unk> .
so , water is a important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; are .
the idea isn &apos;t perfected .
you don &apos;t enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
as soon as it touches the water , you should hear how air it does .
so once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the smallest genome of an individual species , it could actually give you a smaller genome of it ?
we realized that we did , as it worked , a real chance of the time , if we could put the synthetic chromosomes to the bacteria .
so care is <unk> .
the final thing is , a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but in fact , we &apos;re very close in the very close idea of the koran , which is 36 times a <unk> , <unk> , defined by the fluidity .
but the more you add , the more you seem to be lost .
and this number of 72 is never .
this is a nest of a wheels , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a hive that was formed by a queen in the last summer .
the <unk> -- this is a magnifying pattern -- are an interesting group . they go early in the morning before the first group of foraging .
oddly enough , and interestingly , it looks like half of the ant &apos;s only not doing nothing .
the nest maintenance workers just take up all the <unk> , and they put it to the <unk> edge of the <unk> and put it there .
the foragers don &apos;t choose to get out , not get out .
and we did experiments that show that the longer an ant outside the way that we can move the simple <unk> on your surface . so the ants smell that they are different from them .
they meet the entire earth , except of antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of this , for the world , 89 million barrels oil , and the annual costs are three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
it &apos;s nothing to do with it .
i think , where we &apos;re able to use natural natural gas .
and when i put it on the <unk> cost of natural gas at the cost of nine dollars .
why does not make it ?
it just became just 500 million .
it &apos;s never been <unk> , or something like that .
tbp : i have been going to have 150 million in the wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there were <unk> . and there were <unk> .
life is an event . you &apos;ll make it the world .
they &apos;re working on <unk> manhattan , where you built the first building .
and this was in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to make the light light .
a friend of mine told me this story : they didn &apos;t just wait , but then the <unk> , but then the <unk> , when they were there , they had to call somebody .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m sometimes using a clinical language , and so it won &apos;t be so hot about heart as the other conversation about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that <unk> is to be good actions for people who are going to be <unk> .
it &apos;s why , if you &apos;re my enemy or my favorite , if you don &apos;t have my friend , or my family , i &apos;m much less about to be able to use the golden rule . okay .
so , the results are going on . this is a zero-sum game .
every form of interdependence , <unk> , forces one , force the other one .
and they tell you the other that america don &apos;t see them , and it &apos;s actually wants to dominate america , and they hate america .
most of the diseases related to poverty , but in the case of cancer , the kids who died died of cancer , mostly from <unk> families .
a week died a child died , but nothing changed .
because you just don &apos;t have this kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really take it .
therefore , he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the dominant length of the <unk> would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cell and that it &apos;s a <unk> .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of material material that contained the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and see , and lo and behold , and in about four days they have been <unk> and on the right , they &apos;re in a culture .
and of course we are now where we now go ?
and i want to finish with a poem .
we have a <unk> journalist who caught up in the <unk> of the <unk> , a boy whose book so many <unk> quotes , that you &apos;ve taken it from the shelves ; a <unk> about fake <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds a bit like a weird book , but it &apos;s actually a new kind of lie .
he was very , very positive reviews about himself .
you had to have four good friends of a person whose personality .
it &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lying ; they &apos;re going to be , and then they were fort .
they were told how big the bath was , or said the <unk> are so far from the hotel .
so there . okay , glass , do a photograph .
also , you want to be your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes , how many times i &apos;m not the way of the life for email and social networks and so on , although there was nothing really important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of <unk> .
and everybody , that &apos;s , then i went behind .
at least for me , because if i do it the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring , i &apos;m very quick .
i look at me as a -- i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m looking at .
are you nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry ? you look like this .
how do i say that it &apos;s good , but only that it &apos;s not <unk> , ok ?
if you have the <unk> of the long time , it &apos;s going to be buttermilk .
i call it the era of citizenship -- which is people different <unk> or ethnic <unk> , but as citizens can all the same .
in egypt , i was finally discovered .
this had had been studied in london , in yemen and <unk> in amsterdam , an airplane to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are looking for democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , laden &apos;s family is one of the richest family , saudi by saudi <unk> .
what happened there was a political coalition that was a political goal for a political goal , and that was to the leaders .
these tools are being really socially interesting when they &apos;re going to be more boring .
he <unk> the boundaries of the individual networks and then they &apos;re a .
and because of the social mesh , chinese students studying studying the world , or companies from the rest of the world in china , there were people all over the world .
and finally , the chinese are attacking the chinese .
we &apos;re always in a media environment in the media world , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
but all of it &apos;s <unk> , i &apos;ll always be as i &apos;m going to vote as i was .
on my fourth <unk> , he moved a comet a comet over the mountain .
this is the <unk> , the first five feet of the rise of the camp camp .
and this is in camp .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck <unk> , a little climber , in this storm was collapsed in this storm in the snow .
it &apos;s so eloquently , up there , that sometimes , i actually put up syringes , right through the clothes .
this climber was <unk> .
and i can just <unk> how he did that .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back into action .
these are sherpas , the <unk> .
and the fourth thing that i &apos;m very important to me is , &quot; ideas , where we have to engage in . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the entrepreneurial rise , they became entrepreneurs to come to models , and they &apos;re in great ways to society .
it was <unk> people who wanted democracy to introduce democracy , because they were bringing the ideas to the world &apos;s ideas , from universal <unk> , parliament and the , and so on .
the third thing is again .
the second is the <unk> that we have , the entrepreneurs that are so difficult to create common jobs in companies that 93 percent of the indian jobs are in the most profitable part .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to make a modern <unk> , so that you don &apos;t have the <unk> , if you &apos;re older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides the government , let &apos;s go to the government .
although some people don &apos;t want to hear it , it was actually the revolution of the markets that the <unk> <unk> , &quot; the government has no idea .
they &apos;re not afraid of mass .
therefore this whole great cartoonist of mistrust between the <unk> and those who are represented .
<unk> .
each of those <unk> would have been going to be <unk> statistically , for two years after the <unk> .
david cameron used to be 20 million pounds into a social <unk> fund , to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : investment in social change
i &apos;m going to work . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the <unk> ?
even if i &apos;m with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; i &apos;m a <unk> , jack .
if you haven &apos;t figured it , my name is tom thum , and i &apos;m a <unk> . that means that i have just heard of what you just heard about , and just with my voice , just with my voice .
and to the end , with this one , i can do my sounds , <unk> , <unk> .
our people had to try to get about 5,000 different <unk> to find the right thing .
listen , you don &apos;t listen to the people who say you can &apos;t do , and everybody can do it .
on the right side , a <unk> is a <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to give you a few examples .
you see the blue <unk> of the skull .
his wife said , it was &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
so many of these patients are the <unk> of the <unk> .
the results are better than the surgical argument .
he can stop the surgery anytime and stop .
<unk> street , i know .
and that &apos;s where they really have a lot of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that &apos;s going on both angles .
and that &apos;s why you want to go to the next trend , and as we can do as soon as possible .
and your jokes , like the <unk> of a <unk> , really just within those aesthetic .
you need a lot of lawyers and a lot of time before the teachers , and the merchants decided that it would be too much too much too much too much .
these are the two <unk> of the <unk> opposition in the logic of the .
and i want to thank you at this point of <unk> <unk> for the very , for this very <unk> presentation .
once i got a boat to a remote <unk> , and i noticed that the <unk> that i should meet , not <unk> .
i think this is one of the most <unk> and <unk> things on the planet .
there are a lot ancient <unk> in <unk> in the united states , and once you get to your , you realize that the <unk> of the churches were .
here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> .
i hope i can help these organisms , and i can help to make their remarkable <unk> , and to make my <unk> of protection of your <unk> longevity for the future .
so let &apos;s give it to something else .
20 years later , they use a <unk> , but they also create their own <unk> , like this , that the <unk> of the <unk> of mexico in all the 31 31 .
what do they do that ?
what might terrorists do today , do that now , the available technology ?
recently , the fbi has been arrested in the united states that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the united states .
as we see here , we &apos;re going to be in touch .
now , now , mortality mortality , if you put it , but it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s so many people killed that the only <unk> funeral didn &apos;t actually be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get away from the <unk> juarez .

and there are no group that would be more susceptible to this type of manipulation of more than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for the people who are simple solutions , easy categories , because we don &apos;t think of an act of an instrument .
but the whole community , all the different <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because the <unk> , if she &apos;s full of juice , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , they &apos;re eating the world , it &apos;s enough to the skies . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make my wife a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of pleasure .
why do i not mean , for my wife , being able to pull off ?
but here &apos;s the problem . this is a company <unk> pad pad , and it works .
<unk> : i see this thing in my wife &apos;s hands , &quot; why do you make a miserable rag cloth ? &quot;
now , 110 countries can access to that .
and it was so beautiful that i was there in the last seven years .
then i did a huge amount of training . i swam in <unk> and forth .

now , this may be the end of the story -- okay , we just replace it all using conventional , renewables -- but i think that &apos;s more about it .
in particular , in particular , that the abalone shell produces itself , millions of abalone shell , all the time , every year .
and the idea of this was basically , i &apos;m the paintbrush in the hand of the great personalities that come and i would interview .
but i wanted to do the interviews that are different .
in fact , my first <unk> george <unk> <unk> , which was the last year , and i was <unk> , and i was the <unk> -- i think you can define it .
we know the big <unk> , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to say , and the point of the thing is to make anybody &apos;s ridiculed .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t this <unk> , but it was a <unk> for my <unk> .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand understand . &quot;
half the body was weakened , the other ones .
this is a <unk> in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to make a nice stuff .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s not the painting we had made , but what we actually made .
another example : again , stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss <unk> , on the <unk> of the presidents , from the ministers of the presidents , the high officers of the state .
they &apos;re <unk> .
most of the big companies are now <unk> that they have to be very strict policies on bribes and etc .
if you want to go to a restaurant , if you look at the menu menu , then you expect it to be you , you know , you &apos;re going to order to do anything on the map ?
and this was the first time i thought that the expression on her face actually reflects what she keeps it from him .
well , he divides his life .
this <unk> painter had known for his life , but it was a occasionally known people .
unfortunately , these are now spending their most time with a series of other orphans in the archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i was wearing it at a <unk> dinner , which gave us the parents .
&quot; i applaud your name of your <unk> marriage , james .
and my dad lived most of the time of his <unk> in east africa .
i would like to show you six minutes .
<unk> <unk> : but our movies , they &apos;re stories that can identify our people .
so it can really be a young man outside it , it has to think about certain negative things , and all of this , or any <unk> behavior .
franco <unk> : so much of say , so much time .
i think this is really the theme of this event .
franco , you &apos;ve described this as a <unk> film film .
it &apos;s basically a cd . a <unk> .
now the critic is , oh , this was fantastic .
this was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re completely <unk> .
we &apos;re showing &quot; portal , &quot; because you &apos;re taking on walls to create new rooms .
so , time , space , aesthetic , and then , most important , behavior .
on the way , i had to cut a few bridges behind me .
everything is related to the <unk> and students who are the first meeting that they &apos;re going to be a place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and <unk> things that i usually drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful things i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army , for me to be an involvement .
and i had a one day -- oh , the other .
i have the <unk> , and the copper and the copper , so it <unk> .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i was so <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she &apos;s never finished .
the dome was a wish of <unk> .
it was an attempt , this narrow piece of land -- it &apos;s <unk> 76 feet -- in a private frame by combining these areas and the housing and dining room in this <unk> , with a high space .

here it is .

can we not make a cleaner burning <unk> ?
and one of the things that they found out was they didn &apos;t get away .
and this is our <unk> briquettes .
and he has the problem of the health impacts of <unk> wood and coal .
it &apos;s a place where for example , if this was india , in this room only three of us would have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts as in the united states to be able to push the things .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after an operation , everything is all .
now , this is not surprising . but we asked them to judge their honesty and intelligence , kindness and <unk> .
he married . he had a son called <unk> .
is this business with our appearance and our work that we have a <unk> phenomenon ?
now , i want to tell a little bit of the surgeries we &apos;re doing , how far we are and we want to go .
we can replace the bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far from replacing the <unk> of the <unk> .
my theme is the food in schools , because this is about social justice .
and the next thing is <unk> .
people are always talking about sustainability , but we should figure out what &apos;s the at all .
do you know that everybody think they have to do more and more food ?
and they have <unk> , hey , we can sell stuff to kids .
and this is a typical <unk> .
the things we might do , and for so important , we have to teach kids in schools .
we have to educate the employees .
this eight billion means , by the way , $ $ $ <unk> and 120 cents -- so much money provides the government for a lunch .
as a little girl , my grandfather was sitting on a hot <unk> with me outside the sun .
if i go to a party , and people are wondering what i &apos;m doing , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; and your eyes are matt .
i want to know your <unk> , to know about your most iconic creatures -- that you &apos;re a professional in some conscious conscious mind .
do not do that tension . i want to be <unk> .
it &apos;s a documentary that &apos;s about consciousness in terms of consciousness .
when i came closer , i thought , all the most detail of most people can see , their clothes and so on .
how do you know that it was what they did ?
see it ? who of you doesn &apos;t see it ? it &apos;s going to help .
we &apos;re starting to start <unk> . some examples .
today , jeff hawkins has been described to his efforts , a good theory in neuroscience .
and the <unk> of london in london said , &quot; what do you say , &quot; who is in charge of london -- &quot; i mean , no one is in charge . &quot;
now , congestion charges were introduced in stockholm on the third of january 2006 , and the first picture here , here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical street on the second street .
so , we did this huge survey with many <unk> and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- from eastern europe -- through the mountains of the the the the the mountains , the north east north africa , russia .
what do we know about the taliban &apos;s <unk> of the taliban to the doors of the people who are going to send their daughters to schools like <unk> ?
the world changed .
i was the office , my desk was the <unk> , i had the blue <unk> of the walls .
and there was even two of them .
there was really what .
what amazing is that ?
now , i want to talk to you about some of the other patients that are doing all of the things in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized that the page on google earth , where we can fly to the address .
we are , they are most of the most underutilized resource in health care .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
here &apos;s resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment from the <unk> of sound , and i &apos;m talking about the <unk> .
in the united states alone , the annual costs would be on numerous billion dollars in the united states , so we can &apos;t see bats in any case .
why should we deal with aging ?
if you &apos;re going to go out here and look at the night sky , and this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you &apos;re smiling . thank you very much .
europe had to be <unk> into the economic development .
the boom of the resources of the resources of the resources , not all , but many countries the bottom billion .
so what does it go wrong ? why is the so-called &quot; <unk> &quot; ?
and so the countries of the bottom billion , a very <unk> politics .
a few economists just come in and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to auction you ? it &apos;s going to reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , in the world , a billion people are in the poor or <unk> countries , how do we help them ? according to economists collier asks a bold idea , <unk> plan , which we can close the gap between arm and rich .
we have no container where they &apos;re produced .
here he gives a <unk> of a <unk> surgeon in africa that &apos;s necessary to make the extra function of the .
so we did this : imagine , imagine , imagine , you put a lecture and you could talk to people in their language simultaneously .
&quot; <unk> of the <unk> surgery .
14 years ago , i came to this <unk> material , <unk> , which has been used for centuries .
he asks me to be able to build this as a <unk> piece of cities .
so we were experimenting with little <unk> <unk> to generate a dry fog , which is formed by the wind , and the test turned out that it can be shaped by people who can interact with it , and can move through to be able to get to be able to get to be able to get .
they were in their <unk> in their <unk> , they monitored the pattern of the <unk> of the <unk> of the people who didn &apos;t know , and shared the wonders of the wonders .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been paying attention to that this is an enormous risk of our society .
when peter moves his arm is this yellow spot in the way that you see the right place in the process that the in the <unk> mind .
if you do this , what will you control control ?
and to say that those changes are also going to be more than the death of the one : the fact that can be true or wrong .
now let me be clear , what i &apos;m not saying . i &apos;m not saying that science can be that room , or we have scientific answers to any <unk> of moral questions .
now , why would this not be an objective morality ?
how much is the probability of this pattern of human development ?
on the left side , they see edward <unk> .
we live in a world of <unk> technologies and these technologies cannot be <unk> , it &apos;s always easy to break it together as they &apos;re together .
but then we have to talk to about well-being in a more scale .
and what is its natural enemy , what the means of the most of the good <unk> of the good <unk> that we &apos;re talking about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , not a <unk> , but a <unk> insect <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a quick and <unk> <unk> .
and if we &apos;re the good <unk> for example , in a <unk> , , you go to the blooms .
in israel , for example , we have over 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s equivalent to 10,000 israeli -- biological <unk> in <unk> , 75 percent of the world .
third , to raise awareness of the farmers of the farmers of the <unk> .
<unk> is one of my <unk> .
it &apos;s even fun to do fun about the <unk> , than over the <unk> of the , and i do it .
&quot; urban <unk> , &quot; this is what the new yorker needs .
her name was <unk> <unk> , and that was -- i didn &apos;t have a <unk> enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the soviet union , only a few decades , maybe within a decade , after the time , the soviet union was most powerful .
because there are 80 percent outside there , which is really insects .
they are at the beginning of <unk> .
why do we actually do these balls into the soup , but it &apos;s also meat in it anyway ?
it &apos;s 25 kilos per person per year .
we &apos;re going to decide for this , or to five kilogram of output .
we can increase it a little bit of a cost of a , but it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
and you may think , well , they &apos;re not available .
my three minutes didn &apos;t have begun , right ?
he said , &quot; allison , we have to put it on the table .
and i &apos;ve seen a sign .
even if canadians were the system , they do it in a way that society &apos;s going to be .
and in this book , the little one would have the big idea .
this is a <unk> . and on the back , some of the other <unk> , <unk> , and the surface , to make some calculations .
right . so , this is the device .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and the precision that &apos;s just amazing and remarkable .
so , the first robot i want to talk about is strider .
it &apos;s just using that if you have cameras , or the other sensors because it &apos;s up , it &apos;s a <unk> 80 , you can get over obstacles about <unk> and <unk> .
for example , in this case , although the left and the right wheel is connected to a single axis , and therefore the same wheel .
welcome to <unk> , the robot &apos;s <unk> <unk> . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the <unk> .
let &apos;s see how it does . this was our first trial , and ... <unk> !
but what is the secret of our success ?
but just by a radio imagination , not enough .
this is an education of education .
<unk> , who are being <unk> .
there are no pool of good teachers , and only eight percent of the people of the county has a <unk> or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a whole empty amount of creative capital to bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the teammates on the wheels , then the user won .
but in the last few decades , but a lot of money that was destined for the recovery , completely away .
and after outside , and the neighbors of what they &apos;re buying , and where they &apos;re buying , and why , is a homework .
in this case , it &apos;s actually impossible to create large <unk> surfaces .
i want to invite you to invite my journey to the <unk> and exploration .
after four months of season , it &apos;s <unk> and now stand over eight months .
here &apos;s a few results .
this global act is happening in the same way to climate change , how fossil fuels are doing , maybe even more than this .
when i knew about these two things , i think that &apos;s very , both of personal reasons for a scientific reasons .
it has a very good <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was partly by the soviet foundation .
so , for the treatment , we &apos;re going to make a series of a row on a weekly basis of simple <unk> to see how his sight can fit .
the answer is in movement . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re tracking these <unk> , and i &apos;ll have to talk more results .
and then , i have been from these <unk> to physically disabled of the <unk> and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i &apos;m judgments , i &apos;ll tell you how that is .
but this was the fall &apos; 95 and then the winter said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , again , aimee to the <unk> &apos; 1996 , and she &apos;s very excited . your family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i was trying to do that , <unk> against who , against who , against who are the people who are doing here ?
i always had all this , and i thought , what ?
you can be large . they just take off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and the designer will be 2 , and we &apos;ll talk about the design .
they got somebody who came over and the shoes of the .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to see the actual frequency of the economy , it &apos;s because we use math math .
or after the 1950s .
and yet , a little bit about math : math looks at times as math -- like math -- like this , like math -- like , &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in education , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do three of hand .
if people ask me , is that ?
but the mechanization in cars allowed to separate those things , so that &apos;s driving something else to build a car , and the learning of his <unk> .
it &apos;s completely <unk> .
but i think we can do both the same thing .
and one of the reasons why it &apos;s so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the exams .
it was in 2009 , and i was blind for about a year .
i thought , particularly my father , who was dying was a surgical surgery at the brain .
similarly , as you can , just by the grasp of the <unk> , changing the changing the ground , and with the time , a sense of where you are and what you &apos;re doing .
but when i was then <unk> and the broadway went down , i was blessed to the corner .
if you design a city in the blind sense of the blind , there &apos;s many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article was , &quot; i think you &apos;re &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous ones i knew -- the commandments , your next , be fertile , be fertile and <unk> you ...
you give money for a good purpose , and it &apos;s a sense of the purpose of the purpose .
she &apos;s not a book that was written , and from the sky .
so , for me , it &apos;s the key to happiness , to remember that on the way , the car doesn &apos;t get away from the car , and i didn &apos;t get up on the way up the stairs .
it was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to make this book , we have to really have to make sense of , then we have to really be on it , and with him .
so we have this wonderful progress .
so the academics who have this work thought that was too <unk> , so we developed applications like this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> on a <unk> .
alex worked on a little bit of a little bit , a little bit obscure , independent <unk> , &quot; for steven <unk> , and invited us to develop a computer interface that &apos;s supposed to be used to the film .
we &apos;re going to get this <unk> surgery because we &apos;re yellow and <unk> on green <unk> .
let &apos;s pull it apart : i &apos;ll bring it in <unk> .
we , as humans , are the things and we should make sure that our machines are helping us and build on it .
john , thank you doing the science fiction model .
what okolloh did , would not have been possible for digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the <unk> act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line , said , &quot; we &apos;re changing this deal right now .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and how good <unk> do you do a leap from 20 years when the interest in the audience is changing .
you don &apos;t always have five days to have , so we got the change and we began to play .
now india didn &apos;t want to play a game .
the other was <unk> cricket .
was that the new india ? that was a different world where you could get the player from all over the time , as long as you get the best player to get the best player .
we &apos;ve all seen in calcutta , but we had never seen before . <unk> <unk> got the audience with a <unk> song to <unk> -- for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that this day ?
i think i have a experience of you all about an experience of getting richer , and the game of popular and hopefully , there &apos;s a long time to work in this business .
and you know that the dog dogs are because they &apos;re going to be in the memory , how often they have dogs and pigs on the line .
why do anyone see the world of what ? &quot;
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country , and for 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend your $ 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city , the average of the city is worth 100 mice worth , no matter , no matter , but people don &apos;t think that .
well , in the big , and there &apos;s enormous impatient .
watch what happens when we skip <unk> .
dan , i would like to hear more . so you say that our answer is to terrorism , i mean , it &apos;s a kind of mental mistake ?
there are no guns .
and so , some people economists have a stupid people .
and the theme of the variation and the variation is one of those <unk> that needs a certain intellectual activity , because you always have the variation in the subject that you have in mind .
-- &quot; in essence , and in fashion , the same rule of the <unk> is so much as too much as too old , or too old , not the first of the new idea , the last thing that &apos;s the old one . &quot;
and i woke up and said , &quot; well , maybe not isn &apos;t that ? &quot;
one -- my willingness to me to a critical audience , without suggesting i &apos;m to suggesting the one .
it &apos;s my intention of being able to come up with the poster , you know , you didn &apos;t understand it .
so in large , so they &apos;re going to survive our survival .
jews have often a uncomfortable <unk> odor .
if the space <unk> , we could see that people were going to be more negative attitudes to <unk> men .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m talking about , what i did in this 20 years in the distance .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what cinema means .
i was sick .
we don &apos;t need trouble with the stupid box !
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea that we have all of those kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a generation of kids that have so much psychological or damage to conserve , and africa has to go through it .
through the whole book , they &apos;re going to be able to be <unk> <unk> and interactive animations .
so what is the business ?
it had at least the seem to be , as they were always faithful to the most powerful .
so i thought , &quot; yes , this is a good idea . &quot;
they &apos;re still talking about it .
when i came from college , i &apos;ve been working in southern california , and you &apos;re <unk> at the spanish <unk> of the roofs and those kinds of things .
rsw : what is the schedule ?
the <unk> -- they &apos;ve been interviewing me for mit , and they hired their <unk> <unk> to bilbao .
this is remembered me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; well , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you want to spend four months with three months of three , the ideas are still more and more and more and more .
and one thing i wanted to mention to my <unk> , but somehow , it was to thank all the companies that i helped to thank you at the way that i helped .
but in the meantime , these things are momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , by hand .
you see the suits , the <unk> .
the <unk> of <unk> and things are remarkable , and this is what the <unk> should be .
it &apos;s an incredible undertaking , 15,000 workers , i think , five domes and the sixth part is built .
on this level , the 1,500 workers work .
50 percent of the computer in the world is going to be in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of the ad was an issue of the ad .
and wish three is : <unk> . i was told , i was going to make a job , and i wanted to go on this stuff .
and it &apos;s increasingly important that we figure out how we can gain these resources from this extremely complex <unk> .
the traditional ways of dividing materials , just don &apos;t work for <unk> .
the traditional way of making <unk> , is going to be done by oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a <unk> <unk> : many different kinds of <unk> and lots of different kinds of plastic .
now i &apos;m seeing a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how apes make economic decisions and figure out whether they &apos;re the same <unk> we do .
here &apos;s easy . it &apos;ll trade a single therapist for a feed for a matter and waits for you , and you get your food .
they &apos;re waiting for a little bit of a impatient that is open .
imagine that i &apos;m going to put 1,000 <unk> dollars in your hand -- so 10 <unk> a hundred dollars of notes .
you can either choose a <unk> loss -- like , i throw a coin , you &apos;re going to lose a coin . you &apos;re going to lose a lot .
if we made the same <unk> of the same scenarios , they would do the same things people do ?
the person on the left is a safe loss .
maybe it &apos;s not only the people on the last stage of development that stupid mistakes do .
and this is the catch .
but if we think of buildings , they &apos;re just four stories tall .
we have to be less concrete and steel and we have to build up higher , and we have to build up more .
that &apos;s as much as if we had 900 cars on the streets .
<unk> curtains are coming up my windows .
maybe &quot; citizens &quot; because recently , they got up to fight against the decline of the law , and the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
<unk> , the largest and oldest bank bank , mostly in the ownership of the russian government , now , to order to communicate employees and citizens into the development of innovations that are in the development of innovations .
we heard talks about ted , who are talking about their plants with <unk> , and <unk> , to get together , to get on the world of young people to create videos and make videos .
and so i began thinking that the eternal mother always asks himself , &quot; are all kids ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to communicate a message , and everybody read in their own language , a central <unk> , which was a version of the golden rule : &quot; what you don &apos;t want you to do not do not to do it . &quot;
a pastor is to be able to take care of those individual needs .
and we do this through a few of the <unk> .
there are over <unk> messages in washington d.c.
and this is already taken by parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of <unk> fiber optics .
there are also a few constraints of his illumination .
the bladder is a <unk> .
i saw my aunt , when i was five five .
one of the things i witnessed when i was trying to eat my friend , because we didn &apos;t eat food , and we were to the 400 .
as a kid , so young and <unk> , i don &apos;t forget that , forget .
that &apos;s my story , in the form of a lesson .
my lunch , my lunch , my lunch , i i have a foundation that i created , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give us the farmers .
audience : yes !
the third chapter is a more complicated <unk> called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent of it .
we solve this problem at best , by the problem of death penalty .
and even if this happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i don &apos;t remember anything from time when i was five years old .
santa is knows if you were <unk> or not . right ?
but , julie , you were so ready for school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiling , in the sense , that was the right answer . then they said , &quot; do you think we &apos;re all the brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt to adapt ?
i think this film shows the best look at the modern times : &quot; the road &quot;
in the second world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we mustn &apos;t forget that it needs a fundamental contribution to it , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , the good news !
it &apos;s maybe in latin america .
and at this point of the skeptic and <unk> of climate change in the appearance .
we &apos;ve done a project for the <unk> project , a big program , it was : the <unk> -- with many , many , many , many of experts have involved in -- -- a thicker <unk> .
a group of them , it for themselves , and the other group should spend it for other people .
when they went from the first building , all of the <unk> , and they were lifted up and failed , and clearly the question is : they would stop and help it and help them ?
the word is &quot; <unk> , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called the , the stuff : the hidden life is <unk> .
since -- it &apos;s been four years -- i &apos;ve been trained to the best in this area , had been making the demonstrations , and old , <unk> , created created created created , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , a <unk> of art , both and <unk> .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my energy , my passion , my my my mind , my my real life force .
i danced between <unk> and <unk> and urged him to adapt to my <unk> .
well , it was essentially frustration .
this is what it was at the time .
he put them together , and put it into something called the <unk> , and then he turned them into this software , which i think they had originally built his son . and he did this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little <unk> , little boxes .
i want to suggest , yes , do you create a beautiful website , how could i say you shouldn &apos;t make a nice website ?
now , you &apos;re the linked data that they have now put together , 32 traffic , each one of those of those are a protein with these properties , and you can see them .
and that &apos;s what data is about linked data .
all this will lead to two million children , less than in the last year , than in the year 2000 .
and if it is that , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback loops and to make sure that the promises that the promises are going to be solved ?
you just show one of the numbers here , 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to draw on my drawing tips and paint .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m fascinated to explore this field .
how many of you have a cow crossing on the road , from bangalore , from bangalore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re trained to be able to detect the reality of the reality , and that makes meaning meaning .
and they said , &quot; go .
can &apos;t you do something , you &apos;re an artist ? &quot;
this is a box of <unk> .
because if we see somebody by the way , we see the footprint .
what percentage of this have made foreign <unk> ?
obviously , he &apos;s been sat for the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the <unk> is actually very easy to come to get here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve been told today about economists , and i think that most things are very <unk> .
this is the place i &apos;ve been shown you at the beginning .
we &apos;re now a bit more technical .
think of toyota .
they cannot be able to do it , so they accept it and they &apos;re going to work to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to agree .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza your pizza , you have a famine .
there are millions of different kinds of <unk> .
so remember if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re in baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet <unk> chen and goes to the way , &quot; i can &apos;t bear the <unk> .
and it &apos;s like , &quot; how much percent of the day is you think about this person ? &quot;
in terms of 175 societies , people have <unk> of those <unk> <unk> .
they came home with <unk> percent of the home home .
and it really became a strong force .
and i say , &quot; why do you think that men are <unk> than women ? &quot;
at that , there was the planet that was so interesting , so interesting , that &apos;s able to do that .
she &apos;s 23rd she did it since she was 13 .
i began to <unk> why you &apos;re in love with a person in love than the other ones .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called &quot; &quot; this triangular spiral . &quot;
but i know it .
most researchers think that obesity obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should be wondering whether it might be that the resistance is the cause of weight and disease disease -- at least most people ?
others , it &apos;s too much <unk> .
peter <unk> : what if our opinion of your beliefs were wrong ?
my great-grandfather , henry ford , really believed that it was the mission of ford prize , which was the life of the people to improve and make cars for everybody .
and the good news is that we &apos;re today the big problems of cars and environment -- not only ford , but in terms of industry .
i think you can imagine , you know .
but what i &apos;m really inspired by the possibilities that we &apos;re going to have when our cars begin to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that &apos;s able to support those <unk> future .
this is a minute .
i think my mother is , i think , is that a kind of <unk> .
you have to do data .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s essential . &quot;
so what &apos;s the ?
it was great for us , because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , when a graduate student , i encountered adults who really thought my ideas were , and many <unk> <unk> with me .
now , it &apos;s just about the kids . so we don &apos;t . so we don &apos;t .
so essentially , we gave the kids a simple task .
for the auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose , the money that you give us , it &apos;s used to buy hearing failure .
what i &apos;m saying , what i &apos;m clearly like to do is that <unk> is cool .
in a way , in a sense , in a sense , in a sense , in a sense , in a sense , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , which is a more form of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of <unk> experience .
if you think about the change in our society , the <unk> of the country , the 200 years , the same process in 20 years .
it changes change , although they were not known .
so , for example , we would have the models of an artificial sky .
i think , i think , in the peak of 94 percent of the country .
and how do we do something in this growing world , specifically , in a few places where i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , to build 400 new airports .
and this is the center of the <unk> talk -- there &apos;s no lighting of lighting in the positive sense that is healthy and our well-being , and it &apos;s not adequate darkness .
in contrast , the first office i &apos;ve shown you at the beginning of the talk , is this a very famous office office , which is the <unk> .
behind you , they see the <unk> building , which later became an icon of the modern .
i think what you &apos;re seeing here is quite amazing -- how much light can be in the sky , and never reaches the soil .
it &apos;s not very pleasant and <unk> .
they &apos;re not disturbed by the .
if our <unk> , like a few weeks ago , a war in a third of india is called about 200 <unk> , the <unk> , he &apos;s the subject .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- as i was traveling from office office , i saw a <unk> , or it came in the sense : could i be like a <unk> , would be life .

so we &apos;ve been very , very hard , but we knew that it wasn &apos;t so hard to develop the technology , like acceptance is what it &apos;s important about what is important and how the technology can be used .
cars are not done for the side of the adjacent to park ; they &apos;re wonderful <unk> to make them between cities between cities , but think about it , we have trouble to the problems in terms of grasp and velocity .
so if we could <unk> this box here , we could have a solution to transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package , 60 kilogram ?
so neuroscientists or explicit <unk> is suggested that people who are dying , somehow in the treatment trade , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do is you &apos;re either tortured or professional or even more or even the .
in los zetas , as a result of psychopaths , the fear of psychopaths , fear and horror to the <unk> and the press to the silence , and that &apos;s true for most .
mexico and the united states , now , is to be in a truly international organization , the partnerships with the production of the south and world in global distribution .
but also part of it , a month of being more productive than being -- you live in the future , and we have a long time of <unk> .
and after you fall below a critical price , it tends to be able to be successful , a critical mass of the <unk> , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and you look at the interesting effect , if you &apos;re cheaper to lose the brands , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , win .
if you look here , linux is in red , it has done 20 percent .
&quot; open to &quot; &quot; openness , &quot; you know , the gift of the valley is the world &apos;s gift .
because of some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital is in between , and trying to take the best one to the one .
second one had to be extremely cheap .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers of the world has been given to a technology that allowed him to change its life .
and yet , these are the characteristics of the men and women are honored by all the generations .
you remember , during the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in his blog , over the cyclone and <unk> it often , and it &apos;s only possible because they &apos;re easily .
i like music , and i like <unk> , and i think i heard steve martin , and i said , i can also .

and you see that post .
these little things .
and maybe i have to get a <unk> , because i &apos;m going to talk about it .
it &apos;s been sustainable <unk> , except of our generation .
we have to use this process to be able to understand a better understanding of how the oceans works .
we &apos;ve been able to study these fish in the , but we had to learn how we have to hold them .

let &apos;s start with a paradox .
and here , you see it in the relationship of inequality , which i showed you , i &apos;m going to come back back .
first , with the rich , , and then in a second , , with 50 american states -- with the same question : do the more unequal states on all of this magnitude ?
with devastating effects , what the benefits of talent &apos;s population .
and in our analyzing america , we find the same contrary .
the <unk> judgments of judgments , and fear of those questions .
or for example , the reason why violence is more prevalent societies is because people are sensitive to being <unk> .
a year , more than three million <unk> , a new knee , a <unk> knee .
you remember , like kamal , you know , the most day .
