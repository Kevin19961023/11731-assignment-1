you know , one of the most great basin in the research research , connecting with people who remember old days , and the joys of research that are even at the old research that are even at the <unk> oceanographic <unk> , they still have perfect rain <unk> stones into the rain <unk> , they enrolled into the plants .
so , just the idea that the milky way of the devotion are becoming beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the spanish problem in the middle of the developing world , but only as a model of particular possibility , the world is the idea that the world where we exists , not in absolute creation , but only as a model of particular possibility , the world is the world to the our own , but only as a result of a group of specific possibility of a group of specific possibility of what our
and of course , we share all the same <unk> .
we &apos;re born all born . we &apos;re going to be children in the world .
we &apos;re <unk> .
we need to be able to get us with the death rate of death , and not surprise us not surprise that we &apos;re all going to be able to do , dance and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> in the woods of the sahara desert , or the warriors in the sahara of the sahara , or a <unk> on the sahara , or a helicopter on the sahara of the sahara , or a helicopter on the sahara of the <unk> , mt , the himalayan of the <unk> , mt , the <unk> of the <unk> , mt , the <unk> of the world .
all these people teach us that there are other other other <unk> , other ways of other ways to dinners the potential in the earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , it &apos;s only a few hope .
together , the director of the world is about <unk> and <unk> life , the earth and <unk> life , the earth and the most important life that are biological <unk> , which is called the biosphere .
you can think of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> . <unk> can create the <unk> of all of the thoughts of all the ideas and the <unk> , myths , who are from human gatekeepers since the the future of the world .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of what we &apos;re and we act as an amazing <unk> vehicle .
and as as as as as as as as as as as the biosphere is actually this with the <unk> -- just to the <unk> club -- just to be able to speed .
no biologist would car to say that 50 percent or more or more or more or more or more or more or more or more or more or more or more or more or more , that <unk> , which is what we see as a <unk> <unk> on the field of cultural diversity .
and the key thing is the end of the languages .
as a result of you in this room was born in this room , there was the potential of 6,000 languages .
now , one language is not just the dominant majority of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
one language is ralph expression .
it &apos;s a means that is the soul of a specific culture that &apos;s happening in the world .
each language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a a point , a pivotal , a provides a kind of a ecosystem .
and from these networks are going to be today , while we &apos;re here in monterey , not even in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not going to be taught anymore . that &apos;s actually , if you &apos;re actually dead .
what might be more than being <unk> , one of the most effective to be the to be the the last to do , the wisdom of the ancestors ancestors to be the ancestors &apos;s children ?
and yet , in this horrible object actually , in fact , this horrible object actually actually , about two , about two weeks , about two weeks , , activist , , dies , <unk> , , dies , an old person in the grave .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; if we all have to do ? &quot; would not better ? &quot; would not better ? &quot; would not better ? &quot; would be a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would recognize them realize how it would be if you don &apos;t speak .
so i want to take you today on a journey through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try to do to what &apos;s actually lost .
now , there &apos;s some of us , the <unk> of the way that i say , if i say , &quot; really different ways of the .
take for example , this kid of <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people who were the people that the people who were the <unk> , they believe they were <unk> the <unk> from the east <unk> <unk> .
this is a people who are not <unk> between the colors and green , da blue and green , da <unk> , which is the forest that people are , <unk> .
they have a <unk> language and a <unk> called the linguistic citizen called the linguistic citizen called &quot; <unk> : you have to talk to someone who &apos;s someone who &apos;s marry someone who &apos;s someone who &apos;s someone who &apos;s a different language .
all of this in the basin in the basin in the basin , or seven languages , but the artist of these big estimates that are <unk> to someone who &apos;s never hear somebody who learns , the one language .
they &apos;re hearing to and start to talk .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i ever have ever been in the northeast of ecuador , a remarkable people that came out in the northeast of ecuador , a remarkable people that came first in 1958 .
in 1957 , five <unk> , five <unk> , and they were a memorable error .
they took the <unk> of the air , which we would have to do a friendly , which we would have to do a friendly , and they forgot that these people had never seen anything .
you take this photographs from improvising on the forest or the way to see the face or the way to see the face or the character , and <unk> that that was initiated on the the five sundays of the spear .
but the <unk> <unk> , not just the pole .
they &apos;re going to be each other .
so 90 percent of the deaths are due to <unk> .
we &apos;ve found the <unk> eight generations and when we generations and and when we put the people with a natural death , and when we put the people with a natural death , and we found that one of the most old died , and we found it back with the legacy of the .
but meanwhile they had a clear characteristic of the reason that was amazing .
their enduring could come from 40 researchers from 40 of twigs , and determine the pinnacle of the same time .
in the early <unk> years , i &apos;ve got a astonishing astonishing job , whether i was interested in the last couple of societies , i was interested in the following , i was interested in the following , i was interested in the foundation of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the poison that used to do <unk> .
to give you a sense of sympathetic engineering , i had to talk about this remarkable faith of the knowledge of knowledge and <unk> , not a really sad to magic magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex set of metaphysical .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , if i would say the most important food aid , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , <unk> or whatever , or whatever .
another continent is always revealed because the presumption was that there was no religious belief , and of course , there was a <unk> religious , and of course , there was a very true religious religious religious religious religious religious religious , the world &apos;s tragic <unk> .
but what happens is interesting , is this investment between the living room between the living room .
the living rewards .
the study can be avoided water to the big water , and the soul of the dance to dance to dance to the soul , to the soul of the living room for a long time to god .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> , like , &quot; you &apos;re white the church and the <unk> of god .
we dance in the temple and the become the god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to get out of the spirit . how can you get damage ?
you see this amazing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in a <unk> company , a astonishing <unk> of the ability to <unk> without combustion <unk> , a astonishing of the ability to affect the body when you put in an state state of extremes .
now , i think of all the people who i met , was the <unk> <unk> of the sierra nevada in <unk> , the <unk> .
there &apos;s old civilization , the <unk> <unk> of colombia and in the aftermath of colombia and in the aftermath of the conquest , and in the aftermath of the conquest , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent continent , these people have only the only ones that were never conquered by the soviet union .
to the day , they &apos;re going to be a ritual in general priesthood , and the education is very exceptional .
the young boy are being <unk> in the age of three and four years from their families in <unk> world at the base of 18 years , for 18 years , for 18 years , for 18 years , for 18 years , for 18 years , they used to the nine months of nine months , where they &apos;re now <unk> in the legacy of the big mother .
and as all of the time , they &apos;re going to swing in the values of their society , values , the claim that their prayers , values , the claim that their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of these amazing <unk> , they &apos;re suddenly suddenly taken out and the first time suddenly , she &apos;s going to see a <unk> , in the way from 18 years , you see everything in the &amp; , suddenly , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment , everything they &apos;ve learned from 18 years , and in this <unk> moment , everything they &apos;ve learned in the way in the architecture , and says , &quot; look , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really , like i told you .
it &apos;s so beautiful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the most important brothers that we are brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this is very important .
whenever we think about , we toured <unk> and we think we toured <unk> and say the old offerings of the architecture that has a foreign idea of the architecture , and say , these people are more comfortable with nature , as we &apos;re .
so , these are neither <unk> , they are <unk> , they are going to be <unk> .
it &apos;s not much any place in the <unk> of <unk> or the cold <unk> , but they still have a <unk> of the earth , but it &apos;s on a <unk> of <unk> , they &apos;ve been blessed by time and ritual and ritual and ritual is a widespread <unk> , the idea that the earth can take her close to the human mind .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andes , which may be a little child from the andes that the mountain is a really different relationship of montana , as a small child from montana that can have been a very different relationship of montana that are the <unk> , that &apos;s the belief that the belief that the belief is a pile of the montana , can be made .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a sense or a pile of <unk> , or a pile of <unk> .
the interesting thing is the metaphor between the individual between the individual between the individual between the individual .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> <unk> , and that these forests are destined to become <unk> .
it was a different person than the <unk> that &apos;s what they believe that these forest are <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the world , asked the world , they would have to participate on their own .
now , if you start to think of the idea that these cultures can create varied varied , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph that i was just in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , from them , from them , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> .
what &apos;s <unk> is not just the <unk> of this <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s about as if a <unk> <unk> <unk> , from the family of <unk> from the family of the family <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this plant is very strong <unk> , the subject of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> are very effective .
if you saw the <unk> , they have seen that stuff , they &apos;re made of this stuff , this substance that they made out of different species .
this is about as a <unk> child is about as realistic as a <unk> machine , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it &apos;s not a very difficult reality of reality , but the chinese is the .
i &apos;ve actually got to professor with my professor , richard <unk> , the man , the man &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has increased <unk> , who has increased <unk> , who was the man in the moment , since the moment in which you couldn &apos;t have to separate a <unk> .
but the thing is that you can &apos;t get <unk> , because they &apos;re going to be able to be able to fill through a human gut of natural <unk> called the names of the names .
you can only talk about several other chemicals , the mao , the mao .
now , the amazing thing is that the <unk> that are the <unk> that are necessary by the way that are necessary by the <unk> , the precondition is , to <unk> the <unk> .
how can we find these people from both <unk> plants , which is when we combine a kind of <unk> plants that &apos;s not related plants , so that the entire is larger than the sum of its larger ?
we use this great <unk> , trying to try and error , which is what &apos;s meaningless .
but you ask the indians , they say , &quot; the plant talks . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , 17 times , 17 times , 17 times , all of the great time in the forest that &apos;s going to see all the way for our eyes as a kind of wallpaper .
and then you ask them , you &apos;ll be wondering how they got and say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re going to be a little bit of plants .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you are going to carry each of the temples in the <unk> , and they go into a different <unk> .
now , the way you can &apos;t get a ph.d. in the front , but it &apos;s much more interesting than the <unk> .
now , the problem is the problem that even the problem under us , they were considered <unk> and <unk> , but they were looking at the <unk> of the , they were considered <unk> and <unk> , but the real world , that our world , that our world , in the world , that our world .
so , the fact that you &apos;re wondering that you &apos;re wondering about 20th century or technological innovations , where we &apos;ve been destroying , but more than a era where we &apos;ve been destroying , but more than a era where we &apos;ve harmed the earth either of collaborative consumption or psychiatric , or proton , is not the change .
all cultures have always been remembered on the dance with new strategies .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> stopped being reduced to be less than they adopted and try to work when the americans were americans when americans were americans when they were horse and <unk> .
not change the integrity of the <unk> , it &apos;s not a good thing , it &apos;s ugly .
and wherever you &apos;re going to find in the world , you &apos;re finding that these cultures are perfect peoples in the forest , and the tallest of the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> institute in the forest , from where it &apos;s dynamic , a generation of pain , and the new <unk> of the <unk> , of where the stream in the forest , they can see their capacity of the forest , or how to see the forest that &apos;s ready to see the forest , or how to see the forest that &apos;s ready to
or if we go into the hills of leadership , where i think , <unk> , where i &apos;m going to see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> of people &apos;s going to be convicted , but the destruction of people will be convicted , but the destruction of people not not convicted , but in general , it &apos;s widely reformed and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , unless they &apos;re not at the <unk> level of the .
i &apos;m going to be with a young colleagues of 6,000 miles of <unk> <unk> , and only when i was looking at the statistics of the statistics of the end of you , 6,000 sacred monuments , the statistics of the statistics of the end of you . and the <unk> of the <unk> were killed by the soviet bloc .
the father was diagnosed of this young <unk> , identified .
that meant that he was psychotic during the chinese invasion was murdered .
his uncle &apos;s fair to their holiness with your holiness , people turned to the age .
his mom was locked up as punishment for the crime .
he was slept in the age of two years in prison , to hide , to hide her <unk> , because without no no no no longer life .
the sister that this is actually called <unk> , was a <unk> fistula .
one day she came from a <unk> <unk> and for this <unk> , she had to put a tough conference in a tough kilometers .
the suffering can be avoided , and the smartest people of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we faced really a choice . we would like to create a <unk> world of the <unk> world in the world , or in a world of the world , or in a world of the city , or in a world of the city ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said before we &apos;re going to see the entire bandwidth of human imagination in towards a thread , <unk> , we don &apos;t just give the entire bandwidth of human imagination in towards a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we don &apos;t just want to see the whole range of human imagination in a dream , and forgotten that there were ever opportunities .
and it &apos;s easier to think that our earliest maybe our species is .
the <unk> revolution that made the farming , and we &apos;ve been googling in this moment , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , specialization and <unk> -- 40,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world is how we know they know know 300 300 years old .
now , this t. story tells me not that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re facing in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask this <unk> , creative , fathers , they &apos;ll have answers with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to be the possibility of the <unk> , which is : : humans , what we &apos;re : : what we &apos;re : are all the people and can flourish to be avoided , and there &apos;s great moments of the optimism .
here &apos;s a photo that i was going to be the <unk> <unk> , when i was rebuilt <unk> on the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit and during the years of the orchestras in the <unk> of the <unk> , they were forced to be forced to live in settlements .
the grandmother &apos;s old man &apos;s refused to himself .
the family , fear of his life , took all the guns and all the tools .
now you need to know that the inuit is not a fear of the cold , they use them .
the <unk> of her was originally originally originally in <unk> , which was made in <unk> in <unk> .
the <unk> of man was not insignificant on the arctic night , and the statue .
he went out of out , he was down the pants from <unk> and <unk> into his hand , and when the <unk> was <unk> , he started to drink in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> , the sides of the <unk> and the <unk> was entirely , <unk> , <unk> it was a dog .
he <unk> the dog and the <unk> , the skeleton of the dog and a sled , <unk> another <unk> and <unk> , another dog and <unk> over the thames over the thames booth on the right .
so you can make something like something .
and this is a very different level of the inuit and all the world in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in the april 1999 of april a field , the bigger bits of california , the bigger .
it &apos;s our new and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s a fascinating area . they &apos;re controlling all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state of state , a state of state , the undersea <unk> of the undersea <unk> , with his knees .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least , at least for those distant goals of us , at the distant goals of the earth , they &apos;re not going to be .
they are the <unk> of someone .
it &apos;s the same parts of human imagination , which was in the past , and for us , the dreams of us , the dreams of our own children of our own children .
what we &apos;re trying to do with national geographic , we &apos;re trying to think that politicians has never achieve something .
we think we believe that <unk> -- we believe that anesthetics isn &apos;t compelling , but we think that anesthetics can change the world , but we think we probably think , the best institution in the world , our website will appear for 35 million <unk> every month .
we are <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
our papers are becoming by millions of millions of millions .
and we &apos;re businesses in the <unk> of traveling in the <unk> where we &apos;re going to expect our audience , where we &apos;re going to expect our audience , the world , and hopefully , you &apos;ll find a <unk> in a really optimistic new <unk> world , in a group of <unk> , and hopefully , they can find a a <unk> world in a group of synthetic labor , to well-being the wisdom of all human beings in the wisdom of all kinds of well-being .
thank you .
what i first first first talk about , as quickly as quickly as quickly as possible , is the basic work that we have a group of a group of a group of a group of a group of a group of a group where they can either have either locally or take enormous amounts of visual data .
we see lots of a lot of engineers in digital photographs here , which you can do and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , in any way .
and it &apos;s not true how many information we look like big these are these collections , or how big the visuals are .
most of them are digital evidence from a camera , but this one is one of the scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in a realm of 300 registration .
it doesn &apos;t have any difference because the only thing of one system like this , is the achievement of a system like this , is the number of a system like this has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> , dickens , is a chapter , a chapter .
to prove to prove that it really can really autonomously and not just to show something like this , we can actually show something like this is a real state of the <unk> and not picture .
maybe this is a artificial way to read a <unk> .
i would not recommend it .
this is a <unk> case , this is a copy of the guardian .
each big picture is the onset of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience , a real <unk> or a newspaper , a newspaper a newspaper , a newspaper with a more <unk> .
we also have something about the corner of the guardian of the guardian .
we have a false astronomical insight with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal ad before , and we &apos;ve talked about additional content .
if you want to see the functions that car , you can see here .
or others , or others , it may be <unk> .
and this really really ideas , this limitations , this limitations , this limitations of the colliding on the screen .
we hope that this is not a one-way <unk> and other nonsense -- that should be necessary .
of course , the graphic thing is actually a really clear applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time talking about time , except that we &apos;re going to be able to do this .
but here &apos;s all the streets in the boroughs .
<unk> <unk> on the <unk> slide of nasa .
let &apos;s take another thing .
this is even live in the internet , you can make it <unk> .
this is a project with the name of the name system , which really is really two different technologies .
so the one is <unk> and the other one is very good research on a <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> cell , the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and rick <unk> was written in microsoft research , and very good partnerships .
so this is the live in the internet , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
you can see the vision , if we create these kinds of things we can penetrate through images and this experience of the <unk> .
but the spatial distribution of the pictures of the pictures is in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact .
the <unk> display these pictures are filled with the visuals , they calculated the visuals in the canadian crash , the <unk> in the canadian crash , they are literally <unk> or <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , all of the sudden in the relationship .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve been able to show you other .
there are what much more nuanced are the most remedial .
i would like to show a a more <unk> <unk> , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> in the summer , to show you what i think is really , what &apos;s the really <unk> , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> in the summer , to show you what &apos;s the <unk> , and this is not necessarily as if you look at the environments that we &apos;ve focused on the website .
we had to make ourselves because of the lawyers .
this is a <unk> of the sioux <unk> , the <unk> of the financial crisis , which was just a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in a time and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men and on each of men and on each of this kind of model , which was discovered as a model of <unk> .
so all of the <unk> , and they &apos;re all the time on the way in relationship .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work on microsoft work .
i &apos;m very thankful for the edge .
i suspect , you can see that there are many different types of users , and from the <unk> <unk> , everything is to bring a very large number of them , a fairly big number of them that all of these things are in this environment .
and if if you can find some of the strange weird .
many of you are from the inside of the world .
somewhere are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of the time that was really recorded .
we can change the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is here we can do things with the social environment , it &apos;s going to be data from all of the way -- from the whole collective memory of the entire earth -- and everything else is going to be connected together .
all these pictures are connected together and it &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts of the parts .
you get a model that &apos;s pouring out from the earth .
look at this as the sequel of stephen hawking &apos;s work on virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to use the complexities of complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s really using the users for the users .
their own photos are going to develop the <unk> , the one person has made another person .
if somebody who has been done , and all these sacred and all these sacred and all these sacred and all these sacred and i can use them as a starting to dive and and the other , to put them as a starting to dive into this room that will use and thus a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> experience with the use of the other .
and of course , , , , of course , all of these are rich enough to the earth that has not just been through misinformation or algae or algae or algae or algae or algae or algae , it &apos;s powered by collective memory .
thank you .
so i understand , i understand ? your software , within the next several years , within the next several years , all pictures in the world in common in common in the world in common in the world in common in the world in common in interconnected ?
yes , it doesn &apos;t matter different than a .
if you want to make them sweeping between the images .
and they &apos;re doing this because of the gulf in the polar images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the the the the way information that are being a lot of these pictures .
how if you were a <unk> for pictures of paintings , where they sentences and text of information about the website , they have a lot of information about this .
but how about it , if you &apos;re doing all of their pictures of all that kind of images to do with all of their images ?
then the the the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and the classic ones that are going to really stunning . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , this is really incredible .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some of my book from my book , as i hope hoping is , in other things they &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try and get a few euros extension , if you &apos;re not .
i want to start with what i called &quot; fine-grained <unk> . &quot;
so the official <unk> of what ?
the the most amazing thing of all the western industrialized societies .
the official thing is that the official goal of the fortune of the fortune of the fortune of the fortune of the fortune of the <unk> of the individual .
the reason is that freedom is good in himself , makes sense sense , meaningful , meaningful , create a <unk> that human human .
if people are freedom , then each of us to do things for themselves and to decide what the price is about us .
the path is to maximize choice .
the more more people have people , the more freedom , the more freedom , the more they &apos;ve got more more than they &apos;ve got more more .
this is , i think deep in our population , that deep in our population system , it &apos;s too .
and it &apos;s also deeply in our lives .
i &apos;m going to show you some examples that are happening .
this is my supermarkets . no big .
i just want to say about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarkets , if you buy the 10 different charities of a great amount of social growth , which is the <unk> case , in which the unlikely that you might have a great amount of the time that you don &apos;t really care about the power of the time for the store for them .
so , this is how the supermarket is .
and then they &apos;re entering the <unk> business to a stereo , speaker , a <unk> , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio . and in this one of the algorithm , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> facilities .
we can outsource <unk> million <unk> <unk> of al-qaeda , from the components of the components that live in this one .
you have to admit that the big selection is a big selection .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because they could have had given everybody had planned , he could have been <unk> .
they have your phone . they haven &apos;t bought it .
one was a series of that was never break .
this is the days .
we &apos;ve got a choice in the world , especially in the world .
these are the cellphone of the future .
my favorite is the middle of the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and you should not seen it until not in your business , you can be that they &apos;re going to be .
and what it does , it &apos;s going to run to the business and this question .
now you know what the answer is that question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile , not too much .
in other aspects of life , the very much more harrowing as the choice as the choice of the objects , the same explosion of choice .
health is not longer the case in the united states that they get to get to the doctor , and the doctor says what to do .
instead , they &apos;re going to go to the doctor , and the doctor says we could make a a a b or we could make .
a has a benefits and the risks .
b has these benefits and the risks . what do they do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , b has these benefits and the risks and the risks and risk and risk and risk is the benefits and the risk .
what do they do ?
and if you say , if you were going to be , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not going to go . &quot;
the result is -- we call it autonomy . this sounds &quot; patients &quot; -- that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , the sounds like a good thing , but in reality , the sounds like a good thing , but in reality , the sounds like the best is a choice -- <unk> the patient &apos;s patient .
there &apos;s a <unk> for people like they and me , if you think about it , we don &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy a buy if we can &apos;t buy us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
the answer is : you expect to expect to get students to the next american and to request a change to request .
something like our identity , as our identity is now a question of choice , like this .
we don &apos;t invent identity , we invent them .
and we invent it as many new .
that means that every day , when you wake up the morning , you need to decide what kind of person they would like to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time , every one had everybody had every one and they were so quickly as quickly as quickly as they could , and then as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; not when when they did .
now , this is all just simply just to have .
i teach great intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you a person less than i used to .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re gifted .
it &apos;s because they are , you &apos;re asking questions , &quot; should i marry , marry , i marry , or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry ? should i marry ? i want to have children kids , or should ? &quot;
these are all <unk> <unk> .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , and if that doesn &apos;t mean you all the problems that i &apos;m going to give you the <unk> and not a good grade in my class .
and indeed , they should do this . these are important questions .
work -- we are blessed how carl <unk> , with the technology , the other minute every day of every day of every place on every place on the planet -- to the hotel hotel .
there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about the <unk> of the <unk> .
i &apos;m not telling you because i want to use it .
so what it means to mean that incredible freedom of choice we have to make this incredible decisions , again , and again , whether we should work on or not work .
we can play our kids , and we play our phones and our understanding of the waist , and we have our phones to other hip , and our laptop will probably our lap .
and if you &apos;re all of these , every minute , every minute , every minute , we ask our child in the world , we asked our call this call call this call ?
should i write on this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly certainly certainly going to be a experience of the <unk> of your child , very different .
all of us , big things and little things , and little things that are things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in the world where we lived in the world .
and i want to say , there were some choices , but not all was all was a question of choice .
and the world is now in life now .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we know all of the stuff that &apos;s fine , so i &apos;m going to be about is it badly .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , <unk> , is that he &apos;s rocking to liberate it .
with a lot of options that you can pick very hard to decide , it &apos;s very hard to be able to decide .
i &apos;ll give you another example of a study for this , a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study in a volunteer .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> , which is the <unk> of a million blogs , which was about 2000 of filtering and about 2000 .
and what she found was a 10 pounds of <unk> , took the urge 50 percent of the apollo six percent .
they provide 50 percent of your <unk> -- 10 percent less collaborators than if they &apos;re only five tosses . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> , the selection , it &apos;s hard to get hard to you , it &apos;s hard to get it to tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow .
understanding that that &apos;s not just eating the people in the way , they need to go into the waterfall , because they don &apos;t have enough money to the <unk> , it means that they don &apos;t do enough money to do decisions , so hard to miss it .
by not urge to urge compassion to 5,000 dollars a year on the <unk> , the happy of the <unk> , who would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a product of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s possible to make the world look like this .
they want to meet it really really , if it &apos;s all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or the wrong <unk> .
so this is the effect , the other effect that even if we &apos;re the paralysis , we end up with the media effect , we end up with the media of choice , when we could cheat less content with the media lab , if we could determine between less .
and there &apos;s several reasons for this .
one of them is filtered through the great <unk> , if you buy a different choice , if you buy a different choice , if you buy the choice , and it &apos;s not perfect , and that &apos;s not perfect , and that &apos;s not perfect , and that &apos;s not perfect , and that &apos;s not perfect , and that &apos;s not perfect , the satisfaction that they had gotten their <unk> , even if it was a good decision to be choice .
the more of the possibilities that there is nothing to be the more of choice that you make .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a great point today tomorrow morning tomorrow , as a very important thing in which we compare things to what we compare .
well , if there were lots of alternative banking to remember , it &apos;s just a toy -- you know , the rabbis of alternatives that you can do -- they &apos;ve got to do it -- they &apos;ve got to do it -- they &apos;ve got to do it -- they &apos;ve got to do it -- they &apos;ve got to do it -- they &apos;ve got to do it -- they &apos;ve got to do it -- they &apos;ve got to do it -- they &apos;ve got to do it -- they &apos;ve got to do it
here &apos;s a example of the way , for the of you that &apos;s not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should think .
here &apos;s a few on the hamptons .
very expensive , very expensive .
amazingly beach . great day . they have everything themselves .
what might be better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every in my <unk> neighborhood , there &apos;s gone .
&quot; i could park right now . &quot;
and he &apos;s reporter two-thirds of the idea that he missed the possibility of the thoughts , day , a great deal to have a great deal .
<unk> <unk> , the satisfaction that we &apos;ve done through our choice , even if we &apos;ve just imagined .
and the more of the opportunities are more likely to capture more internal properties of this choice in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now this cartoon does some of the road .
it &apos;s a statement about it in the moment , and maybe things can do it right now .
but a more important thing that he &apos;s doing is : always who cares about one thing , they don &apos;t do other things .
and these other things like many of these are , and it &apos;s what they do about it .
third : <unk> the expectations .
this was me when i wanted to do my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing the threshold that &apos;s the time .
and there was a time in the last couple of weeks ago , they bought a bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and they bought them long enough , they were incredibly <unk> and they bought enough , and they started to be , &quot; ok , they started to <unk> . &quot;
so returning to buy new jeans , buy the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to have to have to tell a few of the old ones , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the headline said , &quot; you want to <unk> , easy <unk> or <unk> , easily <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> ?
do you want to be buttons or <unk> ? or intolerance ?
do you want to have jeans with the historical statistics ?
want to go back to the bottom , <unk> , blah blah , blah blah , blah .
my jaw was down , and after i was told i was told i &apos;d like to have to have to have to the kind of the kind of the way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way that was the
he had no idea what was that was , so i spent an hour of all that white <unk> , and the business -- and i say the truth -- the truth -- the news directors that i ever had .
i had better . all of these selection tend to have me better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain myself .
the reason i felt was feeling worse , with all these disparate , , my love with all these robust ways , my expectations for a good few days .
i had very low expectations . i had no no way , when they had only had a kind of a kind of <unk> .
when they came into 100 ways , they should have been perfect , one of them should be perfect .
and what i got good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i &apos;m going to get what i expected to get to the what i expected to do , and i was there in comparison what i expected to do .
the guar of opportunities in life &apos;s lives , inevitably that people can inevitably have the people who are supposed to be .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results .
no one in the world of the <unk> knows that because if you think it would be all right here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that once it &apos;s all worse than anything was all worse than anything was for people , it was for people who were asking the pleasant .
now , in the world in the world , we &apos;re wealthy , most of the demands of perfection , with perfection , with perfection , with perfection , with perfection , with perfection , is that things are as good as you expect .
they &apos;re never going to be a roadrunner because your expectations , <unk> .
the secret is the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;re all right -- the secret is low expectations .
i want to say -- a a little bit crude moment -- i mean , with a woman &apos;s , and she &apos;s really very wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
now , one of the <unk> of a bad artist a bad artist of a bad exhibition , if you &apos;re authentic , who &apos;s going on , who &apos;s not responsible , who &apos;s right , is , who &apos;s right , the world is . what would you do you do ?
if you are different species of information , and you buy a swing , and you buy the questions that are responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is the question .
they could do better .
with 100 different kinds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of intermediate , there &apos;s no excuse to error .
and so , if people are decisions , and if the results are good , you feel disappointed about it , you feel yourself about it , you &apos;re yourself yourself .
clinical hospitals often weigh the world in the world generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and , and it &apos;s also a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and , and it &apos;s also a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the are so high , probably if you have to explain these experiences , you think it would be its blame .
and so the <unk> that we can do better , and , , , , , , , we feel worse .
so let me remember you .
this is the official <unk> that we all of the right thing that we &apos;re all for the right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that something selection , which is not that , but it doesn &apos;t feel that more selection than anything selection .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve got this point long long , where we were going to improve the choice of choice .
now , as a nurse , i &apos;m almost -- as a nurse , the thing that all these different will allow the other differences in the industrialized societies , the material societies is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of you whose problem is not the big selection .
her problem is that they have too .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a specific problem of modern science , rich societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying , it &apos;s steve <unk> , and steve <unk> has told you yesterday about how much more expensive and difficult car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s waste .
what i tell you is that this is this expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they &apos;re not helping .
they even hurts .
they care about it , we stand up .
if something about the people of our society , making such decisions , it would not only work life , not only life , not only life support of people who improve the lives of people who would improve .
economist , this is what economists is called this <unk> .
<unk> is to make it better , it &apos;s all just the poor -- not just the poor , because all these big selection .
finally , read this cartoon , read this cartoon , and , a person person , says , &quot; ah ! does that fish ?
you know nothing to be able to do it . &quot;
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i &apos;ve been doing read it .
and i ever have to look at the rate of view , the fish that knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> plates , so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they paralysis paralysis .
if you break the <unk> plates , so that everything is possible , you lose the satisfaction .
they &apos;re going to the paralysis and the <unk> .
each one needs a <unk> .
this is almost almost impossible to cheat with perfect security council -- possibly for us .
but the <unk> is a chinese restaurant &apos;s been a honey bee for the misery and i suppose .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before the human genome and what that means , and that means the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we have biology now biology and now we &apos;re going to try to try to create the digital code into a new phase of biology by expanding new life .
we always tried to ask the physical questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i believe that many biologists have attempted to understand that many biologists have attempted to understand and the different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to simplify different new components .
we have almost 20 years , when we sequenced the oil of the world &apos;s hierarchy of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world &apos;s biology .
now , we &apos;re trying to create questions whether we create a decade or whether we create new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , <unk> , the smallest genome of the smallest genome genome has an species of species , the smallest genome of the <unk> of an species of a more time a more time .
we &apos;ve been able to get a radical genes about a radical genes that unfolds here .
but if we look at this , map , the very simple map , which is simple , and if we all we &apos;re all going to our , in comparison , in comparison , in comparison , in comparison , in comparison , in comparison , in comparison , it &apos;s very unlikely that leads to a living cell .
so we have determined that it &apos;s the only way to violence , allowing us allowed to solve the pirate and so that we &apos;ve got some fundamental questions .
and so we started to think about the question , we can reinvent a chromosome ?
does it happen to the chemistry , this really is what was still done before ?
and if we can , we can start to start collecting this information chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical chemical chemical chemical .
our steps is expanding about the future of life .
our ability to identify our ability to write themselves has evolved to write a very slowly , and our last point would put on a hot plate .
we &apos;ve begun to start past 15 years ago .
it took place at an early review before before we did the first experiments before we made the first experiments .
it &apos;s <unk> very difficult difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world , 30 to 50 , 30 or 50 , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so you can &apos;t happen to a while , so you have a little bit more .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put this little bits of dolphins .
this was our first attempt to attempt with the digital information , the ocean &apos;s the ocean .
it &apos;s a little <unk> virus in the bacteria .
we made a little bits , a <unk> and dna molecule about the dna of about 5,000 letters .
and the exciting phase came to the piece and the bacteria gave up into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code code .
the viral particles were taken out of the cells and then and then and killed back and killing out of the killing .
recently i have been talking with the oil , and they said that they &apos;re doing this model .
they laughed more than you here .
so we think that this is a situation in software actually build the hardware into a biological system .
but we wanted to go to a lot more , we wanted to build a whole new network , so we &apos;re going to build it in such a whole new chromosome , so we &apos;re going to build it in such a global political current to understand the size of the most potent , the individual of a living cell .
design is the key to the key , and if you start with digital information in computer , you have to be a digital information .
when we sequenced the genome theater , the holocaust riots in 10,000 hybridization .
we found out of 30 and 30 sequence , if we were able to bleed the original sequence of error .
part of the design is to make a chunks of design long , plays with other arms , to build a smaller offset to build a smaller offset to build the smaller <unk> to build a smaller offset that .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have <unk> .
think about : we have a code code : a <unk> code : a , c and ts and ts .
<unk> <unk> that letter -- this is the letters of amino acids , and here &apos;s a single page of every circles for each of these amino acids .
so we can use to write the process code to write our words , , thoughts .
initially , we have signed .
some people were disappointed , and they were not poetry .
we have the bits of so we could just demonstrate that they could just enzymes with a penis , and again .
and we started chunks , starting with <unk> , starting to <unk> <unk> , starting to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , this <unk> to make a breath to <unk> these back to <unk> .
in each step , we have these pieces in the pipeline , we &apos;ve focused on because we could actually try to see a very robust process to create a very robust process to see what you see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of the <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we &apos;re really going to get big big brands -- -- with 100,000 -- -- with 100,000 -- -- with 100,000 -- -- with 100,000 -- -- it &apos;s the possibility of modern molecular biology . and so we proceed to others other .
we knew about a mechanism called the <unk> called dna , the biology use use use to repair dna , which can break together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a message called <unk> <unk> , the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field , that just seemed to be a chromosome .
12 , 24 hours later , all the way back as it was .
we &apos;ve been thousands of organisms that could do this .
these organisms can get investment , they can even live in vacuum life .
i &apos;m absolutely absolutely secure is perfectly secure , space , and then they can move to the search for the <unk> .
in fact , nasa showed up showed a lot of them there there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we used to produce these objects -- actually , we have a biosignature of using the right design of the we we &apos;ve got a <unk> , and yeast , then they automatically translate the bullet points .
this is not a <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can see it even can see .
this is just a more of six seconds .
this is the publication that we had only had recently .
these are <unk> letters of <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that can ever be built by humans .
it has a <unk> of 300 million .
if we were going to throw it with a <unk> of 10 and without power , it would be <unk> sites like this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ? how do we do it ?
clearly , obviously , obviously , it &apos;s a non-toxic more simple , it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier to be if you &apos;re going to do it in <unk> like we are : you just take the mate out , and there &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re all over the clone .
in madurai , the chromosome in the cell , but we just showed that you have a whole bunch of a a a a a a a a a cell to another , and this can be able to wipe this .
we &apos;re <unk> this chromosome a <unk> . white , we gave this both of the way we could pick this chromosome with enzymes to disrupt the solutions , we could pick this chromosome with enzymes to disrupt all the proteins , destroy the proteins -- and it &apos;ll be very amazing than we &apos;re going to be able to disrupt our very <unk> singularity here -- and they &apos;ll actually appreciate our very <unk> personnel .
the new chromosome in the cell .
in fact , we thought we &apos;re seeing that there &apos;s the end , but we &apos;ve got to go through the process .
this is the most primitive evolution of evolution .
we find all sorts of species here , a third chromosome , or a third of <unk> , each chromosome , a third of <unk> , each one of the lucy metric in only one species .
so people who think evolution is just as a gene to a lot of life , and much of the biology .
there are enzymes that called enzymes that are actually coming out of the .
the chromosome that in the cell , the <unk> that we &apos;ve been doing is we &apos;ve had to have been .
it was in the cell , and they realized that other chromosome was so , and so we had just a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s <unk> , blue , because of the genes we had .
and after a very short time , all the characteristics of the species and <unk> into a new species based on new species based on new software that we use in the cell .
all the proteins change is changing the membranes -- when we read the genetic code -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we were .
it may sound <unk> , but we can sound , we can create the <unk> , things quite dramatically .
now i &apos;ve argued this this is not the <unk> -- this is based on 3.5 billion years ago .
and i &apos;ve been talking about that we might potentially have a new shape of the most explosion of the current explosion in the world in this digital design .
why should we should do that ?
i think it &apos;s quite obvious obvious in what we need .
we are from six-and-a-half billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context , i was born in the year .
today , three people on this planet for everybody in the year , there &apos;s three people existed ; within 40 years , within 40 years , it &apos;s four .
we have problems with the food , and clean water , medicine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> for the people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge of 9 .
we need over five billion light-years , <unk> billion barrels of oil , and that &apos;s a hundred million slides .
if we think about biological processes , or something else to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the entire co2 from this material in this material that &apos;s in the atmosphere .
we have now from our discoveries from the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most egalitarian of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen , and they look at the diversity of the space .
we &apos;re going to talk to the limitations of biological reality and the idea of our idea .
we &apos;ve just declared to talk about this fast software to do what we call emergent <unk> .
we have now the opportunity to build the millions of military operations on the day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes to optimize <unk> or drugs new new drugs , we can change a few team , we can change a few of the molecular team in more elegant change change
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or bail <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a recording of the actual <unk> working on the way , you can actually get a plane and new species of total planet , and new species of total <unk> is not to look at the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily necessarily like to look like the future code , and we know how to look like the genetic code .
we focus on the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen just begun to just close to the mobile experiment .
we have given the <unk> and third generation of relatively , today , today , we are going to have much higher higher rates of <unk> or varied species .
but how we think the only impact is a big impact on food or the limitation of food or the limitation of food or the limitation of food , if we see co2 as an aging , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go out of these things .
and we think that we should be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s going to be about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are an method .
but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve got all sorts of different methods .
this is a organism that we have mentioned .
he lives in deep , <unk> <unk> miles deep , where <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s all about co2 in methane below hydrogen , than a nuclear energy .
we investigate , if we can use co2 that can be able to be able to be able to be able to use the co2 in the devices , to be able to do this process .
within a short period , we think we could inject that one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have a really <unk> goals , like the creation of the entire <unk> industry , right , right , if you could do that at ted ?
but equally , equally , we &apos;re facing the same as the same as the development of the development of the <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen this year , we &apos;re always a year , we &apos;re always a year , and we have a dollar to make a little bit about the right ice .
i think that changed the way they can become <unk> vaccines in the jungle .
this is how the future might look like , could look at the speed of the <unk> sped with synthetic bacteria , <unk> bacteria , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we are sensitive to improve people , our goal is that we &apos;re just a chance to survive long enough to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i was a critical to the lhc .
and i promised myself to come back to explaining how the machine works .
now , it &apos;s organic . and for all those who are not there , the lhc is the greatest scientific experiment that has ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever since the greatest scientific experiment .
his job is to create the conditions that less than a <unk> second , which is less than a <unk> second , and that &apos;s going to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
this is the machine underneath the machine .
we take pictures of these <unk> in the detectors .
and on this work , he &apos;s called atlas , atlas meters -- -- <unk> meters in the diameter , 22 feet in diameter .
so this is a spectacular picture of atlas in the atlas in the atlas .
at 10th last september 9 last year , the machine was the first time for the first time .
and this painting was spotted by atlas .
it &apos;s called a huge <unk> in the world .
it &apos;s a picture of the first inquiry that the entire pointing to the lhc , then with a part of the lhc , then with a part of the lhc , to make a rain to the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image , september september , we knew that the machine is working on the machine , which is a big chunk .
i don &apos;t know if this is the largest <unk> , or this , or this , when someone came to the google and the <unk> .
it means that we &apos;ve operated a cultural impact next to the scientific line .
and so , about a week later , there was a problem with these unbelievably robot here -- these golden wires here -- these golden wires here .
this could lead the wires <unk> , when the machine is runs on <unk> .
now , the engineers are under them , and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t do that . they &apos;re little wires . &quot;
you can afford to afford that because if you lose it , they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
now , in minus <unk> , , there &apos;s a greener , <unk> disparity between stars , can withstand the performance .
in one of the links , between <unk> magnets in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
fifty <unk> al <unk> investment are pirated and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this was the result .
now , it &apos;s all specific if you imagine that the magnets about 20 ton , and look at about 30 inches .
so we piled about 50 megabytes of magnets magnets .
and you had to remove what we did .
we &apos;re going to be new , they &apos;re going to be .
they &apos;re all back to your path .
the end of march , the lhc will be the lhc .
we &apos;re going to end up , and expect first piece of june or july data , and we expect our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe .
well , of course , a kind of special , they are the value of social scientists around science and <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s easy to be a <unk> .
i think the fact that it &apos;s hard to that we &apos;re talking about our limitations and the power of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to talk about my <unk> words , his predecessor , his <unk> words , his <unk> words , his <unk> <unk> , who said , &quot; nothing , his scientific beliefs , who said , &quot; nothing , his scientific beliefs , who said , &quot; nothing , his scientific beliefs , who &apos;s not in nature , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that it &apos;s not new freedom . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books , books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that it &apos;s going to change the way .
but it &apos;s exhibition something like a lot of the kind of leader in my life and my career that &apos;s been to to do my life completely .
this <unk> event was that i wrote recently a book called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the result , the result of the things that i come to come , treated when i was the <unk> .
yeah -- the <unk> <unk> !
for instance , they come up and say , &quot; don &apos;t negotiate , &quot; you don &apos;t mean that they never be the success ?
don &apos;t you have afraid that they have schedules and create a book , the bailout in the world , the <unk> in the world , the world was in the world ?
okay , that makes really clever .
but it would be worse if i would remember about 20 years ago , when i would remember about 20 years ago , when i wanted to be a writer , when i was going to be a writer , and the same kind of <unk> was confronted by <unk> .
people said , &quot; hey , you haven &apos;t afraid , ever ?
do you mean frightened that the humiliation of a <unk> ?
you haven &apos;t afraid you have a afraid that you have this craft your life and never got something that was and it never got something that &apos;s going to die with the lyrics of the controls ?
so , you &apos;re about to know .
the answer -- the short answer to all this questions : <unk> , <unk> .
yeah , i learned about this stuff .
and i had always been .
and i &apos;ve been much more things that no one would be .
like algae and other things things .
but if it &apos;s been writing , i think recently about the way , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logically that you should expect that that manager has been expected to be in that he &apos;s afraid to do work to the work of work to the work to do ?
and what &apos;s right with the creative ones , they &apos;re insecure to define us , and they &apos;re insecure about the progress -- in a way that it hasn &apos;t do ?
my dad , for instance , i couldn &apos;t remember his 40 years ago , when i was not a situation in his 40 years , where he was afraid to be a afraid of being .
and with your <unk> , john -- how do you do you do ?
it wasn &apos;t just about it , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of blindness , no centuries of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we seem to seem to have seem to have a kind of reputation but not only the writers , but the creative of all the <unk> , they seem to have electric pressure .
all of you need to do , you need to get the bitter of a really great model , from the 20th century alone from the 20th century , the young and often .
and even those who are not actually <unk> , who had <unk> <unk> , who had really been quite frankly to be quite frankly .
norman <unk> said his death in his last weeks ago , his books in his books : my books had a little bit more .
extraordinary , they can do about their own .
but we don &apos;t even know if we hear somebody like , &quot; we &apos;ve got the idea of information that creativity and <unk> , we &apos;ve got the idea of information that creativity and <unk> and that art -- and that art -- and that art -- always to <unk> .
the question i want to ask today is : is this idea about this idea : is this idea for you totally ?
feel that you &apos;re probably ? because with only one centimeters , you know , i don &apos;t even know that .
i think you &apos;re .
and i &apos;m just enjoying you dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how they acquired to the next century .
i think i think if we do our big creative creative .
and i know that it &apos;s for me to me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , this light path of the stranger of the <unk> -- especially in the fact that i was in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 to <unk> .
and it &apos;s probably probably that everything that i &apos;m going to write about writing about the world as the <unk> , the following success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s because we are here here , because we are now here &apos;s a bit probably that my my talk is behind me .
oh , jesus , what &apos;s a thought .
these are the kind of thoughts that can make someone on 9 a.m. , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , and i don &apos;t want to do .
i would rather work to continue to do this work that i love .
so , the question is : how ?
after all , the <unk> seems to me , to write , to write about privilege to write a kind of <unk> <unk> .
so i &apos;ve got to find out to find a a reminder of muhammad a <unk> distance between me and my very natural <unk> <unk> , how to be the reaction to the suv .
so i was in the last year after the last year after the last year after the past , and i &apos;ve tried to help other societies to see , whether they are probably better or charismatic ideas , as we can help , with the emotional risks , as we can help , with the emotional risk of creativity .
this quest to me , and the old rome .
please join me , because the circle is going to be .
but in the old greece , rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity of humans , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , who was a distant , the <unk> source of a distant , unknown waiting .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> .
from socrates , he &apos;s known that he believed , he would have had a <unk> that was carried out of the other .
the roman people had the same idea , called the kind of <unk> <unk> , <unk> genius .
this is great . the roman couldn &apos;t really get a genius , an elder problem that was an informed dramatic individual .
they believed that a genius , this was literally <unk> , about how <unk> , who was a <unk> <unk> , who was a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and artists and the artist in the work of the work , and the conclusion of work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance , from the distance , from the distance , from the psychological , from the following of your place , which you work out of the consequences of the consequences of the consequences of the consequences of the consequences of the consequences of the consequences of the consequences of the consequences of the consequences of your consequences .
and everybody knew that it was so work ?
the artist of the <unk> was some of the things that are protected , like , like , like , for example , too much ?
if your work was not permissible to you all the time for you , everybody knew that you weren &apos;t everything for you . everybody knew that you helped to have this <unk> , and they helped me .
if your work is not about the mistakes -- not to your mistakes , or ?
everybody knew , your professional was something called a little bit .
so people in the west really really really long time , really long time .
and then the renaissance and everything emerged . we had this big idea , and we had this great idea , and we had this great idea , and we had this great idea , and we had no room for the amount of creatures , the orders of creatures that are going to take orders from the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of the present power and human beings , and the people started to the own individual .
the first time in the history , you &apos;re going to tell people or or something about this or or something like he got a genius .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a person person to say to allow a person person to say to allow you to engage the same as the basin and the essence of all the divine , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> is a small responsibility to a lot of responsibility to a lot of responsibility to a lot of responsibility to a lot of responsibility to a a <unk> , human psychology .
it &apos;s like somebody like somebody who &apos;s sun .
the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and it creates all these <unk> bricks .
i think i think that this <unk> our artists were wiped out .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- it &apos;s true .
can we change it ?
maybe a long understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just suspend the <unk> from 500 years , we just couldn &apos;t just put in a <unk> talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience , which really <unk> <unk> , the idea of -- <unk> , the idea of -- <unk> , the people who are <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m not going to give you all of you .
but the question i want to say , &quot; why isn &apos;t it ?
why not that you think about it ?
because it makes sense of sense like everything else is , from the way that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about trying to explain the absolute <unk> of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s -- like everybody knows that has attempted to do something -- -- in other words , every one -- so , everybody &apos;s -- not always properly .
in fact , it can be <unk> .
i had a more encounter when i met the extraordinary poet american <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who had been working on the fields on the fields . she told me she told me that she was a <unk> sitting on the fields . she said she would feel like a poem about the landscape .
she said it would be like a <unk> train from air .
the stories they would be <unk> .
they felt , if it would be the earth under their feet , to get their feet .
they knew they knew that they could only be able to do in a moment , and this was -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
they ran out of this poem to the house as they &apos;re talking about the , and a pencil , so they had to get quickly enough to a sheet of paper , they can , when it was literally through them , you can , and on the sheet .
in other 40s , they didn &apos;t quickly enough enough enough , and ran and hurried enough and hurried , and they said it would be more quickly , and they said it would go beyond the shore and -- as she said , it would say it would pull it back after another poet poet .
and then there were moments -- the part of the part , i never forget -- she said that there was literally times when they were bored .
so , they &apos;re looking for the home and looking for the paper and the poem that she was just as a pen , and the poem that she just as it moves through them , and then she said -- it was so as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as
they &apos;re the poem to his tail and back back back into your body and put back back into your body and put it on the sheet .
in this level , the poem came out of paper , and the total of paper on paper -- but backward , from the past word .
and when i heard the ladder , i thought this is exactly what my creative process is exactly like my creative process .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the canal .
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work every day at the same time , to make a time at the same time , and really sharply to me and really alarming me .
but even i was even in my <unk> , sometimes this thing .
and i guess that many of you have done that many of them .
even i had to work on ideas , which from me personally that i can really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s this thing for a thing ?
and how do we deal with it in relation to lose our minds , but in the fact , but in the fact , in conflict ?
for me , the best living , , as you can do this , can create the the the the the musician , i was performing for a magazine for a magazine .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? the most of his life was the embodiment of his life was the embodiment of the copyright modern artist , the surgeon , the way that they can do in the way to compare the body and connecting to interact with them .
but then he was older and he told me that he told me that he was walking on a <unk> suit , and there &apos;s changed everything for him .
he was driving a little bit of a melody , he suddenly suddenly got a little bit of a melody that , which was the way it &apos;s difficult difficult to do , and he &apos;s going to have them , it &apos;s <unk> , but he wants to do it , but it can &apos;t be able to do it .
he didn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he didn &apos;t have pen , he didn &apos;t have a pen .
so he starts to be able to tell this old <unk> in him , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and i will be haunted by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t get it .
but instead of panic into panic , he stopped just sitting on .
he was writing the whole thing about the whole thing , and did something completely new .
he looked just going to heaven , and he said , &quot; <unk> , can &apos;t see that i &apos;m going to see the car ?
so i see it from what i could do is just like i just mention a song ?
if you really want to get to get to a moment when i can .
if not , <unk> &apos;s other people .
and <unk> cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen cohen .
his whole thing is changed .
not the work itself itself . it &apos;s not like dark like that .
but the process and the severe <unk> , the following , the following was when he was the president of the time , where he was he was like a <unk> and he &apos;s got to he he he he realized that it was not a <unk> , <unk> .
it could sense a <unk> , <unk> , bizarre , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> thing , the <unk> , the <unk> .
when i heard this story , it was also a bit like i was working and it was hovering for me .
this idea was looked at me as i was in the drc of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , i fell a pig , a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all the time .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom was in the helicopter sky , and i was trying to talk about it .
so i put my look at the manuscript and spoke to my comments in direction in direction .
i spoke to the loud : <unk> , you , you know , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely the blame , that it &apos;s not completely my blame , right ?
because you look at that everything i &apos;ve got , and i have , i haven &apos;t seen .
so if you &apos;ve got to have it , you &apos;ve got to see here , and your economic growth is the useful .
okay . but if you don &apos;t want to do it -- you know what , then they &apos;re going to be .
i &apos;m going to write about this , because this is my job .
and i want to give you to i admit that i &apos;m today today today , &quot; <unk> <unk> .
because it &apos;s like this -- in the end of centuries , centuries , centuries ago were <unk> to <unk> , centuries ago , centuries in the deep <unk> became the hours of the united states -- to the dawn of 2012 .
these were great because the sun were trilobites , because the nurses were the professional goods , and they were fantastic .
but , , , , i rarely rarely , was something special , and one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one
and i know you know what i mean , because i know what i know that they &apos;re all in their lives .
it was when the time , the clock &apos;s <unk> and the dancers did not ever done it before , but not just had ever done , he did ever before before . but all of them together .
and not quite not more longer than any longer .
he was introduced by the inside of the bottom and and everything was deposited through a <unk> fire .
as a thing was happening , i knew what was that was , and they called the <unk> .
they put the hands together and started to sing bakery <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god forbid , god forbid .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
what &apos;s interesting historic : when the <unk> <unk> , they took the perceived to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you &apos;re still going to hear that in the <unk> system .
if a person in spain , something , something that says , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> view .
and that &apos;s great because we need this .
but , the tricky morning , the next morning , if you saw a tuesday -- and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 , it &apos;s a tuesday -- and he &apos;s not just a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> . and maybe he never never again .
and maybe you &apos;ll never speak somebody from somebody &apos; name when it moves , it &apos;s about spinning , but what does he start doing the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is a fundamental role of view of a creative pigmented life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t need to be a whole way of <unk> , if you don &apos;t have believed that the most dominant aspects of their brain .
if you just think they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source of their own source of their life that someone else &apos;s betting for someone else , if they &apos;re done .
if we start to start thinking about this , it changed everything .
so i started thinking and so i think i &apos;m working with certainty in the &apos; 30s , during the past months , during the book , the soon as dangerous , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
what i &apos;m constantly constantly to say about this is about this is : don &apos;t worry about it .
don &apos;t have to be .
just kidding .
if they continue to be on your head , whatever it &apos;s going to be .
if your job is the dance .
if the <unk> turns out that you &apos;re going to tell you the side of miracles , decides , for a moment , for a <unk> moment , then <unk> <unk> .
and if not , dance , dance .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
i think we should feel like that , we should teach the .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> for you , just for you to make sure that you are the mere human connection to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
whoa !
last year , i &apos;ve been these two slides to illustrate the arctic <unk> , which are the arctic <unk> that are the arctic <unk> , the <unk> of the lower 48 states , to 40 percent of the age .
but this is not enough enough to solve this particular special problem that particular problem , there &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in some sense , the arctic is the arctic <unk> , the <unk> heart of our global health system .
they &apos;re growing in the winter and the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is , is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> .
the <unk> is saturated with red .
as you see , it grows on the <unk> , this is the annual ice ice in winter ; and it &apos;s in the summer .
the so-called <unk> <unk> , five years old or a older , it &apos;s almost a mere way , which is almost like a <unk> that &apos;s from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be here .
this is a problem , the <unk> , the <unk> , the arctic ocean , where there are big amounts of the arctic amounts of <unk> carbon , which is what if it fails to methane .
compared with all the time , the <unk> of <unk> in the atmosphere , could double this if we double this particular dot .
so today , in some of the <unk> , lakes from the water from the water .
professor <unk> , the university of professor in alaska , with another flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat flat , traveled to another flat flat .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
and one reason is , this enormous reservoir of north america .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is essential as the proposition .
this is the <unk> river flow in the southwest monsoon .
if you want to know how the latitude of ballast , you &apos;re going to the ocean .
this is slowed down .
the other end of the planet , the biggest <unk> <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers researchers researchers researchers , the entire continent is now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that &apos;s about a few <unk> &apos;s <unk> , is particularly strong .
this is 20 feet , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the new lakes that had a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world , half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes , the <unk> is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s also affecting the most of the water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of the <unk> of the sierra leone .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions , as they &apos;ve read .
this is all the world in wholesale , a dramatic metric .
and the disasters around the world in a really <unk> and unprecedented <unk> <unk> <unk> .
four , many of the past 30 years , like in the <unk> <unk> .
this is a fully buddy company .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s going to be .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve 70 70 million tons of co2 -- 25 million tons of every day -- 25 million tons of every day in the ocean .
look at the domain of the eastern tropical continent , and <unk> of indian <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> decline of the oxygen where there &apos;s a <unk> decline of the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , which is that 20 percent is burning , which is burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the result of the result is the most important problem .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> <unk> , with china .
and the proposal was , many additional <unk> .
but we start seeing a transformation .
here are the ones that happened in the last several alternatives , with some of alternative alternatives that were pushed .
<unk> is there a political in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a $ <unk> dollars a $ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> spent a <unk> to promote a <unk> to promote a contradiction that has already a contradiction .
this painting me is a painting .
to christmas christmas christmas , i went home to a home , a billion tons of <unk> .
they have seen the aston in the news .
this is in our entire country of america in the coastal coastal aquarium .
this was this happened to christmas christmas christmas .
one of the advertisement of the cheerleaders to christmas christmas tree .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
it &apos;s in the envelope and the middle of intellectual , and it &apos;s also improving our economy .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> &apos;s going to clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and bread .
this is the most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me say , let me say , nancy <unk> , they <unk> <unk> , harry , harry potter , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
so the power for two <unk> in life .
this is a one of the one .
so , in the <unk> , we &apos;re climate change climate change for our business .
so we have measuring us to get us to the top of the <unk> to request a <unk> to request a <unk> to the truth .
and the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and smells too well .
so , they don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s go ahead .
<unk> coal , they heard a lot of them .
so let &apos;s make a look at a tour of this modern , <unk> <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the <unk> .
and yet , the burning of coal , one of the main distribution of the main character is , the remarkable thing that you see here , changes everything .
look at it , this is the <unk> , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative is going to represent the positive alternative , and our belief of the nih safety .
america &apos;s in a crisis , the economy , the homeland security , the climate safety , the climate safety , the climate safety .
the red thread that everybody connects us to fill our dependence like sexual coal and oil oil oil .
but now there &apos;s a choice to take us out of this <unk> situation .
<unk> america runs with 100 percent of the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years , within the next
a plan to work in work , to make us safer and to help the global warming .
finally , a solution , the big enough is , our problems .
<unk> america . they find more .
this is the last thing .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways that our dependence upon old , dirty <unk> , which our world were monitoring .
the future is there , and wind , sunshine and a new system .
new investment , to create good jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you were going to be , quick , go alone .
if you want to go far , go . &quot;
we have to get far closer to the very quickly .
thank you .
i want to start by looking at them , you know , you &apos;re going to be playing with <unk> .
as you realized , as you create the hands and <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the problem with solving the problem and change and change the understanding of understanding understanding and change the way to solve .
the creation of the think is tightly tightly , as we understand a lot of our environment .
celebrity as good -- inspired with my favorite <unk> , i began to wonder , what would be if we were going to use computers , which would be if we could use computers , which would be like a flat <unk> that would be like a flat <unk> , who could intervene with both hands could interfere with both hands could and try and get it so way that we want to do it ?
this question was so stereotypical , so that we decided to take the code of the answer and <unk> .
in short , , a <unk> is a new computer computer in the size of a <unk> computer .
you can be able to move each other , you can perceive each other , you can look at each other , you can have your motions and a screen .
much more important : are physically you so you to make them like <unk> just through the flow of the animal and the way .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> data .
and if these tools are becoming a awareness of engineering and a conscious , each other and the <unk> of our minds of our minds of our minds of our minds , then we can start with the gun new new and <unk> .
i &apos;m just making with some of the simple examples .
this is the <unk> <unk> and when i put it into a direction , the video &apos;s video , the video &apos;s video , and when i go into the opposite direction , it &apos;s backwards .
and these regimes portraits , each other .
so if i put them side-by-side , you &apos;ll find your interest .
if you &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;ll notice that , and also can be nervous .
and they &apos;re also mapping and create their motions and create .
one interesting result of the interactions that we began to recognize the big bang , we could use a big gestures on data , like a little colors as to interpret this .
in this case , we have three <unk> <unk> than <unk> and i can use use to use color in the middle of the middle , where they are blended .
if we exaggerate it , we can make a little bit of <unk> .
there are also some of these kinds of information opportunities in education like verbal or <unk> , where we want to give people the possibility of the fast , and the results immediately want to see .
here &apos;s me here , i &apos;m a fibonacci thing i &apos;ve been doing with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically basically , you basically get a round of randomly monastery , <unk> characters and <unk> , and as you try to create words , that will be able to form that data will be a dictionary .
then after about 30 seconds , it becomes more and you have a new arrangements and new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids that are going on a trip , and i couldn &apos;t move them , and then a video of it .
they &apos;ve got really loved .
a interesting thing about this kind of applications that &apos;s about applications that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of the office .
all of you have to do is to words , &quot; and you know what to do .
here &apos;s a few people that are test .
this is our <unk> <unk> down there on the right .
it turned out , he wanted to have to just ever read the sargassum .
so , for him , they just <unk> .
this is a interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for automobile .
this is the <unk> .
he can read new characters in the scene he calls the <unk> <unk> off the table that this character .
here he &apos;s the sun .
the sun goes on the sun .
now , he &apos;s going to seize one .
the orange broke .
good work ! yes ! yes !
by the <unk> shake , and they wanted to put the characters , he can make the characters ...
... ...
hello !
it &apos;s a story with the <unk> and he can decide how they &apos;re forming .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;m going to spend time to show today , is a <unk> <unk> for <unk> , which we developed and <unk> as a sound , bass , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can pick it out what you want to do .
and you can put these decisions into the sequence that you can have in the neighborhood .
and you put them a way to a , just by a <unk> .
there are the effects that you can change the live change , like hall and filter .
you connect it with a specific tone , and it tends to be the final .
and then , as long as tools and <unk> , which you are looking at the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s go .
we start with the <unk> in two <unk> and this fits in a row , and this fits in a line , and a bit more more about the voice .
now i &apos;m going to play an bass .
now i &apos;ll do something to do .
and now , i &apos;m now , i &apos;m going to create the filters with the gift , so i can create the effect .
i can accelerate the whole sequence of 21 speed into the way to the speed .
and now , i have now , now , i have the filters with the bass ; there &apos;s something more expression .
i can become the sequence during the grid .
i don &apos;t have to design them in the front plan , but you can click , but you can click .
and finally , i can browse the entire sequence of the <unk> , by drilling to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , it &apos;s just going to be my desire to develop the better new way of our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to give you a part of this new <unk> and some of the ways that we &apos;re working in our lab .
the notion that i want to do with you with you to the brink of the blank , is that we &apos;re at the cusp of <unk> , with digital media , the information of <unk> media that our demands our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m really excited to show me where you guys !
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m really excited that i &apos;m there .
so , yeah , yeah , what should be <unk> ?
i &apos;ve got to <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been discussing a few years now with the <unk> , and i start because i just wanted to know , i just wanted to know , and i start myself , and i wanted to do it , and i wanted to do it , and i wanted to do what i learned in the history of the study .
so that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to move on the matter , so that .
i think the molecular molecular is , so generally generally , , , biotechnology , biotechnology , biotechnology , anything , anything that you have learned biology and so on .
extremely important , now , now is extremely important , now , is extremely important , much more important will be more important .
there &apos;s so controversial things like this whole <unk> plants were regarded in the <unk> .
there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> state , which is trying to make the <unk> <unk> , so they &apos;re communicating from algae .
and then , then , there are also things that are totally the idea of the most people , but not aware of the most people not aware of the most people not aware of the 40 degrees , for example , and wash tens of thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the list can be the <unk> .
and so , from interest , this thing , this technology , i just keep there .
so what &apos;s so hack so hack in the world .
most people know most people know most people know the <unk> .
computers and hacking hacking hacking , and then it &apos;s going to be in the media always break up and make a claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws and claws
this is sort of the <unk> very sad , because that &apos;s not what they really start to actually start and what is really about .
and it &apos;s the <unk> , in the 70s , <unk> with <unk> and also and also that the internet .
and it &apos;s about to be about the inevitable , creative , , to solve a problem .
and problem , this is not just a problem problem , can be a problem , can just be a problem , which just can just be a problem , a problem , a problem , a question of <unk> , a question , and how can you make it better .
and it was just a stop it &apos;s just going to do with software , but there &apos;s also a whole bunch of <unk> that can do there , a whole bunch of <unk> that &apos;s happening all kinds of things things .
and now , in direction , and there &apos;s a metaphor that is actually actually a vital code that &apos;s actually a constant code that &apos;s actually a constant , because it &apos;s cold , it &apos;s constant matter how computers , because it &apos;s constant matter how computers , because it matter matter , so it is matter the actual matter is dark matter is dark matter , so it &apos;s real matter is , and not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program and you can also , and you can also , and you can also fascinating and incredibly fascinating , so , and i found just a lot of deep on the way .
this has actually been able to really form eight , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is originally from the switzerland that is originally from switzerland , which is originally from europe , but the future members or a bad people everywhere .
these are a more artistic , so there &apos;s lots of artists and philosopher and philosopher and philosopher and philosopher and philosopher and philosopher and philosopher and philosopher and philosopher and philosopher and philosopher and yeah , there &apos;s <unk> and yes , everything .
but it &apos;s actually about to find a glimpse of a spontaneous tedtalk , so a <unk> way to have a playful way .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> network , which is actually more like this kind of forum where you tune up and online .
and the are a bit technical and also a little bit of <unk> , da , then , <unk> , <unk> .
and based on these networks that made the entire costs , has expanded a scene that i want to go back to the end .
here in the hubble line , you see , this is a <unk> , so a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a private school , bill trade center , bill trade , mobile phone , educational <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
children , old , , old , all kinds of people go to the just time , they have a lab and look at what you can do if these <unk> .
here &apos;s a group in indonesia , <unk> , which is the group in indonesia , <unk> , who is quite long .
and as these other russia .
and they also have a artistic aspect of the biological materials and , yes , <unk> , , <unk> , <unk> , and combine it on quite <unk> .
one group of champagne that i have ever met in ankara that i &apos;ve ever found this is a <unk> that would be like this , the end of the public , the <unk> , which they learn from <unk> and people trying to explain what &apos;s going on .
and i &apos;ve got up in the other painting in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in the developing museum in the middle museum .
and this is , yes , this is these are fairly young people , but the only thing that one thing all the rest of the united states is the technology .
and what you can do with and also also the time to the society and ask , okay , okay , okay , so , what do you want your to be your own , you have your own , you have your interests in order to do with it ?
so , <unk> , to be now , you need to be able to material material .
you need to mix biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
so , what you normally usually understand is , these are sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , extremely , extremely , extremely , extremely expensive , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
and our approach was to say , that you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is not necessary because each each has actually been proven to actually transform higher every higher developed technology than most <unk> , which is really .
and so , i &apos;m learning with this premise that premise that premise that premise that premise , a <unk> <unk> , has a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and , yeah , so <unk> , so <unk> , works .
so , every one , which has a soup that he had to stand up too long , even .
i &apos;ve tried to do this in my lab , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , a little bit of <unk> analysis , a little bit psychopathic analysis , and a little bit of <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s why <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s why <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s why <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s why <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s why <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s why <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s why <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s why <unk> <unk> ,
now this should not be a joke , but .
here &apos;s the lab in the slide , you see the lab , so all of the time , you see the lab , a group of the <unk> <unk> , a group of the unsuspecting <unk> , a group of the unsuspecting <unk> , a group of interesting and quite interesting interesting things , and also quite interesting interesting things , because i want to say a project that &apos;s a project .
and this is <unk> , which means that follows galois , which means also <unk> <unk> , this , that , so kind of a kind of <unk> <unk> in the molecular molecular biology .
and so , yeah , so , so , so , so , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively smooth , so that can make relatively relatively <unk> , to the <unk> , to the bigger organizations that have the more more <unk> , the more more <unk> in <unk> form .
but even the approach is always the approach that it might be easy to stop and available .
the first project we did as we did as as we did , as a real time , we &apos;ve been here as a real time , and we &apos;re online , we &apos;ve been here as a real time , and we know , people who are chatting and so that we know about people who are doing and so .
and then the <unk> <unk> website , the founder of the founder of the telecommunications , and frankly , we also need to meet , and we also need to meet , even more , and then two , a in london , <unk> , <unk> , in san francisco .
and then , then , that &apos;s also what it was about , yes , who are we what we want to do what we want to do ?
and what are our values and what is our hope , our foundation , our foundation , our foundation ?
and then we have a <unk> <unk> .
so , it was quite intuitive , so everybody has just got his wishes , and what it was going to move , as it was going to move .
and there was a whole good code , a good code .
and we have a chinese , but that &apos;s what this is , but that &apos;s what i think , has got a pretty good job that people are right .
and we tried to try and also tries to try to the academic world , but there &apos;s not so much .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> of the <unk> , in the way the academic world , as the world world .
yes , what do we do now ?
a project that i made with the <unk> in switzerland that we made an antidote to the so-called kind of <unk> , hysterical feynman <unk> .
this is what if you &apos;re a laser , you can put little particles , you can put little particles , you can put little particles , you can put little particles , you can move this little bit of little particles , so , the &apos;s the way that like a <unk> in the principle .
this is really , in academic engineering <unk> , and we thought , we may also be able to collectively , and we thought we might be able to move , and we thought maybe , then you &apos;ve got a microscope , the microscope .
this is what you see .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and then it tries to focus on this camera .
and this has not always been declassified , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of learning .
so another project , the <unk> group of the french group group that has led to work out of the french , that has led to pretty cool .
it &apos;s a a <unk> , so a <unk> , so <unk> or something like , so , &quot; so , so , so he &apos;s got to be filled with <unk> , his <unk> <unk> , his <unk> is the <unk> .
he has himself , this helmet there , because in the cooperation , the large-scale confronted with the museum .
there were the visitors in the room , but on this chair , you &apos;re going on this chair , without having these <unk> .
then they were measured their <unk> , and depending on what they &apos;ve got to or how they thought , is that different square miles in the room .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing about the united states , which was also the <unk> , which has to do that , is the <unk> that is the <unk> that is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about to copy to copy , <unk> , fragments , fragments , fragments , gait , fragments , that you can do .
so , if i take this <unk> at the coast of the coast , , there &apos;s any method that would be <unk> , and then they can say , collecting any method and then they can say , <unk> , this hair is inherently like this .
and the machines that make up the way that , which is quite hard to be able to capture the food , the <unk> , <unk> .
and this isn &apos;t stop in the basin , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that has also a lot of technology that has much more .
so this is just one application of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot
and there &apos;s been two builders and said , <unk> , <unk> , which is what we &apos;re getting and cheaper , and then , from open source , <unk> , which we &apos;re getting and cheaper , and then , from open source , <unk> , these vectors and the cheapest of the cheapest of the cheapest field of the world .
i think , sort of like this , or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still cheap , but it &apos;s still cheap , but it &apos;s definitely a framework where it &apos;s going to be .
so it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project i was starting to start counting on this , was a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , the next one that &apos;s going on , two centimeters or so .
you &apos;re <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and the <unk> , into this <unk> , and then i then put them on the surface and then the way that they were doing .
so the machine that you see that you &apos;re not working .
but this is so my prototype my prototype my prototype my prototype my prototype , the greek , so on a branch that binds , electronics and pressure , electronics and pressure and that pressure was too high , the thing was going to be .
and then i &apos;ve got a <unk> , and this is what happens .
a <unk> bubble , if you power the power supply with water , the enough pressure , so i think so 40 to <unk> military .
and then you can convert the particles that are capable of the enough and then go into the egg .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> , or something like , so something like , so that &apos;s the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the fifty .
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically a little bit of the point .
so this is the moment , the <unk> of the scene , this availability of technology , this availability of technology , this availability of technology and the <unk> , the <unk> , that more people can engage .
because , as the first time , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have have lost in the same way of doing it , and no chance to form .
because , as you read about it , you know , from <unk> , that &apos;s not exactly the same thing as if you &apos;ve got to be seen .
and i think technology is always going to societies .
and if you can make a <unk> citizen citizen , you can make a decisions in the society , and can you need to know the access to knowledge and to technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> is open source of the <unk> open source of <unk> and <unk> .
so , you &apos;ve just seen as citizens in the situation , which is just to have that scientific technology .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who are officially officially on the website , <unk> website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also in measurably measurably in the world .
this is me , because this is fewer people , actually , actually , as a middle-aged .
so i know about some of the ones that don &apos;t have .
and these are just the <unk> that individual people .
partly , with these <unk> , so these places are sitting there .
and that &apos;s quite a very simple thing .
as he was just recently .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , the <unk> in berlin was the first first , <unk> .
and this is a very thankful that is very good , yes , <unk> , <unk> , the most dominant world in the world .
and we hope that we hold alike and also also spreading together and also also , so , also , so that they can be involved in the game .
and i would propose everybody to see and even himself , and even more realistic .
it &apos;s not just simple , but it &apos;s not impossible to determine if you attach out there and enough energy , you &apos;ll see there , you &apos;ll end up there .
thank you very much .
this was the .
yeah , hey .
how how do we work ?
this is a question that worries me is very much more deeply than the <unk> , but also in the <unk> , and in the field of the field of self-reflection .
there &apos;s how you humans have to be media in africa , so you can use this interactive media source of skills , and they &apos;re an <unk> of the <unk> of an <unk> experience .
i think the opportunity media , cognitive media , cognitive models , cognitive models , which is looking at our biological capacities , so , cognitive models , which is very long , very long long time ago , and that &apos;s just blown up in the back and we can get through the interactive .
and this is very amazing , because you think , you know , that &apos;s actually , you know , that &apos;s actually a really good thing in the future , but actually , it &apos;s so that the future is right now , in our own way , we &apos;re in our <unk> roots .
what are actually <unk> models ?
i have four <unk> <unk> , and i want to talk about the way .
and excessive cognitive cognitive models , we are the concepts that we have to engage in the pre-industrial way .
so , i &apos;ve heard these basic models that we &apos;ve heard of natural natural gas to the .
that sounds like a sound .
i &apos;m going to start to take a second and get to show you to show you an natural ratio of mine .
the second is that we can actually look at the <unk> models of the world &apos;s brain , although we can actually see very , even though we &apos;re an <unk> language .
and the third thing is , the subject of themselves .
we know that the interactive media is <unk> , what the core of the <unk> , what the core of the <unk> , what we &apos;re saying that we &apos;re seeing the terrible thing as normal .
the fourth thing is that the story for us is a place of the <unk> .
as it &apos;s now with the virtuality with virtuality the with virtuality the world &apos;s actually the world &apos;s actually happening .
i want to prove to prove .
how many expressions of the house , in the front of you ?
we won &apos;t answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to be able to happen , but it &apos;s going to happen and just stop the moment .
they go in the spirit of this house , in <unk> , <unk> , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they &apos;re <unk> the reality and the without computers .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
and we give ourselves in the <unk> of the <unk> , the virtual reality of the virtual reality in our <unk> , we can &apos;t do that the whole time .
and this network is the virtual reality that the reality has given people in the way that people have trained people in the pre-industrial circle of <unk> , because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they don &apos;t have schedules .
they had no exchange .
the only thing that was that they had her head .
and in this bag , the memory of madness .
in this head , knowledge and cambridge was using this virtual pictures , the was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was also the <unk> , which was
and so , in fact , it &apos;s also so much so much so good .
the interesting thing is when i get a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going .
the interesting thing is that this was at this time of the human genome , and the medium itself .
if you think about it , if you can think .
what are the media today ?
then they &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s a transformation .
but i &apos;ll talk about it again .
and it &apos;s all the most prolific <unk> in the world .
<unk> , preacher , priests , so-called <unk> , were able to maintain knowledge to the stories .
and today , we &apos;re very quickly , very strong .
the headquarters of the book , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , , , , , we would still have a 1.1 <unk> over the drc .
this means for a child who &apos;s going to be able to to finish of the most of the most of his stories .
now we think our love is that we &apos;re going to think about as a child in the lap of our parents .
no , no , no .
this goes much more , in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
for me , in the field of media , as a liberal impressive than a liberal , the that we can use step back in our biological capacities , the ability to think the ability to think about the ability to think the ability to think about the ability to think the ability to think about the ability to think the ability to think about the ability to think the ability to think about the ability to think the ability to think about the ability to think the ability to think about the ability to think the ability to
i have an example of the <unk> tribe of the <unk> tribe .
and life lived in the soviet bloc of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area of a very <unk> area , and you had to raise food .
and they have this with this so-called <unk> .
you may know you might feel like this , if you &apos;re concerned about it , you know , the australian advances .
the have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have schedules , but they &apos;ve got so <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this interesting thing about about eight , the power of the regions of the brain of the hundreds of thousands of years , could be about eight benefits .
and then the language of <unk> was <unk> by <unk> .
this is , you &apos;re talking about sound and above rhythm .
and this openness and this rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region and that has also also gives you these songs , and that &apos;s why you could just couldn &apos;t have these heavy , and then again to move back to jail .
why don &apos;t we note to not to get a distance to b b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happened ?
it &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s so <unk> .
we &apos;ve given a glimpse of the same <unk> .
it &apos;s the present and it &apos;s the only book , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the book .
and so , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening is that we &apos;re presenting the responsibility for our memories and the our own production , and the our individual &apos;s own production of our individual memories .
this book and the painting .
so we &apos;ve got to get a piece of <unk> <unk> .
joey is suddenly in europe , and has to become more important to do more .
bruce brown brown , a famous <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , is so far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as a pilot today , what we consider as an indication of our memories , and our capacity to have our capacity .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the federal <unk> .
what has focused on our thinking , and our <unk> ?
then , the most attractive of civilizations change the pre-industrial cultures .
and the are in the course of the centuries , more and more <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is what we remember instead , we have a far tag in masses in masses , far , in masses of memories , we can use our personal memories .
we produce more itself .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t ask the thing in the images of things that are not in lolcats , but we would leap up our language .
we &apos;ve been interested in this things that things happen .
and we &apos;ve been filming the general height , and there &apos;s only exceptions , and there &apos;s only exceptions , as a <unk> .
what &apos;s the most surprising is , is the <unk> .
we are we &apos;re the <unk> as a <unk> , very strong .
the question is , what does it happen ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had this , and we recorded this as a <unk> .
and this sounds very consonant and sounds very , very , very , very , i know .
but this concepts of the <unk> that we have to explore this opportunity to explore this opportunity to explore our capabilities .
there &apos;s about a hundred , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain this right time a little bit .
there &apos;s also technical concepts like the <unk> system , which means that the extended reality that are the extended reality .
so , if you look at google <unk> , then it &apos;s so a concept of the real world , which is so important , what we see the virtual world , which means us the virtual and a bit of the normal , the virtual normal , the virtual normal , the virtual normal , the virtual normal , the virtual normal , is the virtual normal of normal , unlike the virtual normal , natural information , and it &apos;s going to be .
another example is the way virtual reality is that reality is reality .
so , the first thing in the context of my talk , we &apos;re complaining about physically not <unk> , <unk> worlds , the worlds of the <unk> .
and others have the most amazing examples of these are smart systems .
these are spaces that are so attractive to a people .
all the need the ability to ability our basic capacity , as a real real habitat .
i &apos;ve just hope to work , a very , very beautiful project , which is a very , very beautiful , very beautiful , that &apos;s the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and the two <unk> are here today .
maybe you may be able to get your right time , so they can talk about the project .
and this project i &apos;ve brought as a example of this <unk> , cognitive models , cognitive sources .
this is a game , i have to say .
what happens is extremely <unk> and it &apos;s a different .
and when i say , you &apos;ve got very , you &apos;ve got very , very likely to imagine that there are 400 people &apos;s <unk> or a hammer with any <unk> <unk> or a hammer .
anyway , definitely , they &apos;re doing that .
this is a game for the outside .
and this is a human , i thought i was the outside , so i &apos;m going to announce the real-world world .
and this game is connecting the virtual world , so the data , so the data , we &apos;re able to create the real world that we &apos;re talking to the real world , and we &apos;re interacting with the real world .
i apologize , i &apos;ve got to work .
you can explain to the much better , there &apos;s more more more much more .
it &apos;s about that i want to throw a city by looking at what you look at the future of adam , three-inch or negative , or negative , negative , or negative .
and so i get from the city to another , a very different sight , a very different sight , which is a brand-new impression , which is so different , a whole different , or a whole bunch of other , or a whole bunch of city .
and we can now have to look at the time .
ah , what you see here is sorry , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
of course , in fact , in fact , in the walls , in our cities , yes , yeah .
and with a kind of a <unk> , we can make these virtual worlds .
so i &apos;m going to tell the love , i &apos;m going to talk about my talk to my talk , and so we &apos;ve been focused on this way , technological , and so we &apos;ve been focused on this way , technological , and so we &apos;ve been focused on this way , technological , new products , not to change the way that the qualities actually don &apos;t change in the future , but actually leads to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m excited to be very excited to show you .
i &apos;m asked asked , if this kid is a <unk> bag , a <unk> bag of laughter , and my rather than that is speaking .
it won &apos;t be .
i &apos;m going to have what &apos;s inside .
but i don &apos;t do it , again .
yes , children are inherently from a curious or should designers .
i &apos;m going to do it from the house , so i &apos;m also interested in the subject of curiosity and how do we lose the topic , and why we lose curiosity , and why we also lose curiosity and have to go back again .
this is a whole range of things that you just emptied alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside alongside you with the actual baseline of side .
if you were curious , they &apos;re often often often often often <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve got in the last half year .
a <unk> system for intelligent health user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user interface user
now you &apos;re asking why why are the transition leaders to natural <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and so on .
and i think , i think , because the things always should be able to use , always , <unk> , and then you have to see what &apos;s going to see what &apos;s actually got to look , for us humans , what &apos;s wrong or skydiving .
and i &apos;ve got to design in the field of the field of fine-grained brain , so the next generation of man in the relationship of man , so , the next generation of man , to deal with our tools , as our tools or how our computer models are changing the digital assistant .
so i &apos;m busy busy in the end , when i think about , when of course , when you &apos;re intuitively .
may have to go back to a look at a look .
why does that happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , there &apos;s a little bit , then we move from the third largest <unk> or <unk> .
so , the modern <unk> in the <unk> .
every society is a different <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> <unk> through the language .
so , you know , you &apos;ve found that you found a common language , but you could communicate with each other , or other areas or other areas , or other areas or villages , or villages and has so <unk> .
the <unk> was the language , but something very natural , something very diverse .
you had to learn to learn , so no can &apos;t speak a rocket can go to nature , but we &apos;re learning it <unk> and better .
this was also relevant by ancient society and the first form of the food .
this was a <unk> , because of course , the institute of the financial hills in the form of writing , which is what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on , and compassion and <unk> and i put it in rock and i put it in rock and i it also .
depending on as i <unk> and when i &apos;m <unk> , it &apos;s natural different than if there &apos;s a whole bunch of different than if there &apos;s a whole of a group of speakers .
but then <unk> moved to the record as a <unk> , <unk> .
then the next generation we &apos;ve been today with this .
this is just the pressure and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and others .
and then , at the time , it was a <unk> where <unk> , <unk> and other said , if people have said , if people lose the people , then the <unk> , and other , is totally <unk> .
and now we &apos;re going to generation in the next generation , so a <unk> is all just all of the same kind of <unk> , and we &apos;re basically basically at the moment in this <unk> phase , we we &apos;re going to perform that .
the most confused things of natural media , because we &apos;re seeing on the one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook , facebook and so forth .
with the other transparency , what the new think is what the new thinking , no , no , no , no , no , that in the <unk> , no beef , or other phenomena , which is just going to be just <unk> and wants to be <unk> .
and these two worlds are going to be able new and the old .
the exciting thing is , if you take the pandora , these <unk> , these <unk> , these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
now , now , but not more on local plane , but on global global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that &apos;s why the subject is an global warming problem .
not if i &apos;m going to make a local food and the neighbor thinking about less , and they don &apos;t work .
this is actually a global village in fact , from the same principles of natural principles of natural principles of natural principles , of course , , social scientists , community , <unk> transparency .
so as you know , in the village , who knew what &apos;s going on and when it &apos;s about extension of our self , this extension of global <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a way that we know , we know about globally and better student .
so , as it was just in the village .
i &apos;ve just wondered about the wheel , i &apos;m going to start with this with natural , what &apos;s really what we might have chosen <unk> with natural , which is what we might also have <unk> , so , what does the difference ?
because often people have people , they can &apos;t do that , so everybody can violate .
so you have to worry about what &apos;s happening , and not just to change it , but it &apos;s not just about it , but it should better be better .
and when it &apos;s also something like prism and how i can take care of how to take a <unk> , so that they make things that you can take a <unk> , so we &apos;re doing fun and just use fun .
you also have a way to then , also , even during the subject of perception .
and this is why you start and look like , okay , and says , okay , okay , right now , look at the inner self .
and how does it look because it &apos;s actually sustaining ?
so how do we work if we &apos;re going to <unk> ?
and what does the exponential of natural , intuitive , intuitive and how does that affect our channels and how does the printers ?
because steve jobs told once said , &quot; you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so you really have to do in detail when i do something like <unk> or something <unk> , what is happening in the core .
and you see , you see a a a a a a a a a a a a lot of the senses we have only five , and there &apos;s certainly in the next future , the next , the way , eighth meaning , and as extension , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again ,
and what do we like to information , how do we take information ?
alone alone , what &apos;s going on ?
information is , every difference , everybody &apos;s a difference .
many of the word , knowledge , but not what it means .
but i need to understand in the core of the core of the data , when information , when information from data from data from data from information , so i know how to do , and from information , so i can do that , and also , of course , can make assumptions of kinds of things .
and of course , as you get design as well as a result of influence .
we see this , when i try to do things , then i can start out how on the right-hand side , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can show .
so , very much more natural , in a gourd , but i see , sort of like , where is salt and pepper pepper .
and if i say someone &apos;s say , i urge to or 100 or somewhere , then it &apos;s going to be right where it &apos;s what happens .
and so , on left , and then i hope hopefully that there &apos;s no sugar , the salt of the salt .
but also , our perception themselves , how do you think .
and for instance , this perception is in the context .
the right now looks bigger than the little circle , although it &apos;s just a same way , but they &apos;re just to make a same equal problem , depending on our perceptions , depending on whatever , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on , depending on whatever we &apos;re going to do things .
anyone know what that &apos;s that ?
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> , it &apos;s work .
there &apos;s more likely to the speed .
so it &apos;s the most remote .
a second circle starts to try to do some social .
and then when i <unk> , we don &apos;t see a recipe , but we don &apos;t see a recipe , but we don &apos;t see a unit , and yet we see see a unit , we don &apos;t see anymore , a circle , a circle , another one .
it &apos;s called <unk> or <unk> <unk> , which is also us to do in the perception .
important for the outward force that &apos;s the most important thing that makes the great semester of the great <unk> .
<unk> the closeness , the <unk> of the continuity and so on .
they &apos;ve forgotten again .
but this is a essential part of how to mention things , if you want to try to figure out of the same thing .
the next thing that &apos;s really interesting is very interesting is the end of the .
sound is quite frightening , but also , is also what you &apos;re busy with it .
so we have the eyes and now think we &apos;re seeing from the beginning .
this is wrong .
you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see .
so , you can see , you &apos;re going to see a box that you recognize , what you recognize .
this is , we &apos;re going to see our vision , before we &apos;re looking at the back of the back to the back in our <unk> , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay .
i &apos;ve been so known as cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what what you see what you see what you see .
and then this is what this is coming back .
then , then again , again , again , again , again , again , again , because the drama that &apos;s the end of the front of the front of the front of the front , and secure you can &apos;t see what what you &apos;re looking at .
and then , then goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so , a very peculiar process , quite a <unk> process , like some things and what augustine to do things in which things happen .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s this painting .
and there &apos;s what happens happening right , what i &apos;ve just acquired .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to recognize any of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
does anyone to tell something specific ?
a <unk> , right .
once i saw that once , that &apos;s a <unk> , you know , you know .
they &apos;re never forget about , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now , you see the <unk> .
and further , now , you see him .
this is , i &apos;ve got them actually lost them in more directly , but i &apos;ve actually got trillions of it within the patterns of time , always , always , always , this dog belongs to the dog in this evolutionary image .
and this is this projection of the <unk> , <unk> , vision .
now i know now , and now i now i now i i i i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , quite quite quite a exciting processes that you &apos;re not , and then in this , yes , it &apos;s not , but here in this pouch , there &apos;s not , but here in this pouch , there &apos;s no , but here &apos;s actually just in this honeycomb mass of the <unk> , there &apos;s actually a <unk> seal .
anyone know what three seconds are ?
oh , yeah .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s also always known as designers .
if i know , something takes three seconds , until i &apos;m also very good <unk> , i can also start very well very well , very well , i can certainly put three seconds .
this has to be clear as present .
then , it acts in the past and so i can certainly <unk> <unk> , for instance , when i first know that .
what does <unk> <unk> ?
yes , milliseconds .
and also , a very exciting phenomena .
this is the period of the period of time in which you &apos;re in love .
that means that , if you know , if you know , you know , who look at the time , because i don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> for what can happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomena .
this is the period of most of the beverages we have .
this means , this first impression in a radical fast speed , like we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re seeing , what we &apos;re talking about , and how we also refer to the environment that we can do .
of course , the only way we &apos;re not only with the subject of the subject or <unk> , but on , on , but on , on the subject of the <unk> .
so , as a human being poured .
there &apos;s even more <unk> to the hands-on functions , so that they &apos;re sort of periodic or <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> , where i &apos;ve got to be a really important thing .
but there &apos;s symbolic information , why is someone functions , why are someone not <unk> , so <unk> sums of money laundering , although it isn &apos;t so practical ?
we &apos;re more on the <unk> , we &apos;re more on the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be able to deal with .
returning to my sanity , the actual interface of health care system is the subject of course , which means <unk> , is <unk> .
<unk> means always means i can achieve quickly a a certain goal in a way of a certain goal , and can effectively be a user in a specific <unk> community , efficient and <unk> a goal .
so , as they say , &quot; you &apos;re more likely to do .
how can i do something to do something like ?
can i grab my heart valve or i need to get or need to use it or a <unk> .
and less <unk> or <unk> .
i just think of the only <unk> and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean that it better .
that &apos;s what you need to understand .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen the software that we &apos;ve seen software that we &apos;ve seen in many percent of our modern health , or not in babylonian <unk> is a not to <unk> usable in many of areas , although , even though , even though , even though it &apos;s probably a classic software than classical software .
and it &apos;s not just been declassified since apple a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , when i was going to do this , if i was going to do this together .
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re going to install the natural user interface , which is the natural user <unk> , for example five , for our goal .
you have to imagine what you do is that if you do something of the classic <unk> , five hours , five hours , five hours , only one hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean you probably four hours of a couple of hours , rather than 120 hours , you know , your employers or a company , you can see a prize that he &apos;s doing with the four hours of the four .
i want to say that it &apos;s designed for us to do for us a <unk> <unk> , including certain things .
if we &apos;re going to take a look at the area of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> of the united states , the very abstract , where you have to get used to the systems , where you have to deal with these systems .
then the next thing then we say , in the way , now , the next generation , they say , you know , you have a idea of something that metaphor metaphor , the metaphor of the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make computers .
so , more of the and brain code , but just a metaphor .
the thing made the entire <unk> , but it &apos;s also much better better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> is working very much more .
so i &apos;m very lucky to act very much more than that .
this is also a paradigm shift .
i &apos;ve been always going to look at the success of success , just the <unk> <unk> .
and when i go to these kinds of <unk> in these reviews , where i think , , , , , , , , , , and not more and more and more and more and more and more and more things that are going to increase the things , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then again , then
but that leads me to the point where the point when will make things that oppressed ?
if you &apos;re going to be able to get more dopamine here , and look back my little friend here , and look at my little friend of view of the <unk> , when is actually something really relevant ?
and this is for us humans , is always something about something , when i think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t want to think , but it &apos;s just going to make it .
the less thing i &apos;m sort of say about the beam .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
that &apos;s what we look at the fact that we look at a different <unk> of a different , for example , for example , for example , then i can do this as the as the as i do .
this is , i can just end up a <unk> , human <unk> , human <unk> on a software and so that software can do the software .
and the question is actually the question , which is actually so <unk> by people and now i &apos;ve already have .
this is the so-called <unk> .
so , the use of us and <unk> is a acronym and the acronym is a acronym and the <unk> , <unk> .
so , everybody &apos;s a whole time , but it makes the whole of the time and and it &apos;s sort of <unk> , and yes , and , sort of <unk> , and yes , and yes .
the model is already in the womb and it &apos;s <unk> , so we &apos;re working on the whole of the young , and it &apos;s going to be used in the whole of the model , but that this model is that this model .
<unk> <unk> , about fifty to the level of activity from us ever since , depending on the sleep , so we &apos;ve found that it &apos;s less often than the day .
i can now have now , this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and by these kinds of devices , similarly , similarly , similarly , but not a metaphor , similarly , similarly , similarly , but a metaphor of a physical object , a <unk> .
and this is a higher notion of the <unk> as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> of the <unk> .
and if i go to the , if i was going to see as a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s going to look at me in detail , and yes means , &quot; hey , i can see that somewhere , i can relax or stroke or <unk> , etc .
then i can do this whole .
i &apos;m going to give you a <unk> .
he &apos;s got every pies .
so , i &apos;m going to talk about the object , you can <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the entire books , you can filter and can say , just all of the things that you &apos;re all going to be like .
and then on a brain , which is a interface , which is a lot of natural natural .
because i can investigate things like the <unk> , <unk> , and they come to me , it can come to me , and you get it to me , other kinds of mechanisms can create these things .
sydney &apos;s added more <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then , and then , and then , and then designers elevate the evidence to help the evidence , to help the evidence , to help the evidence , and in this sense thank you , thank you right now to your attention and request .
i want to show you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing is when you &apos;re going to take care of the baby , when you have allowed to play more or less to play , or less , more or less , or less , or less , or less , or less , the more time , the more time , more , more than that , you &apos;re going to get your curiosity .
and the effect doesn &apos;t learn .
so , all the way that we are all that are here here , and are curious , which is an characteristic you can &apos;t learn .
so i &apos;m going to talk about this entire <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in quality of quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and the depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> is a chance .
every day , you give you daily two percent phosphorus , you give them two percent phosphorus , and you have to follow two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth teeth .
they cannot store no energy .
they cannot have bones .
we could just as a <unk> <unk> , through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t have phosphorus and the <unk> .
so , in fact , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re here with something , which is really , but really , what does it be known , but not nearly .
because all of energy , but no one talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only been for two years , and now , in the <unk> laboratories worldwide world , the environment are now in the environment , in all the environment in the environment , in all the environment in the environment , in all the environment in the environment , in all the environment in the environment , in all the environment in the environment , in all the environment in the environment , in all the environment in the environment , in all the environment in the environment , in all the environment in the environment , in
in the last 20 years , <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> uranium in germany .
and we take all the stuff .
it &apos;s not about leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment when we are a little bit less harmful .
so , , , <unk> , the environment , the environment , the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the environment , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the environment , carbon-free energy .
that &apos;s not a protection .
this is how if i say , &quot; <unk> your kid , mom near the three times .
this is just a little bit of the .
if we think about the <unk> to the <unk> , then our entire will be used to the whole family , sooner or later , or later , later , a <unk> .
so , to think about the <unk> to think about the <unk> .
and the most important thing that is when we &apos;re going to do .
in the ground , over 13 percent of the tropical theory .
so , in the moment , we build maize mines and lose and lose and lose 300,000 kilogram of 30 years ago , or on the surface , or on the surface .
that means we lose losing the ground in the ground , as a new .
we can engineer the <unk> .
and everything is , packaging or content .
in <unk> , at the <unk> , the <unk> 20 <unk> , the <unk> exploded .
and because we &apos;re going to be the <unk> bigger .
this is all in the <unk> .
yeah ?
one baby needs about the <unk> .
we could to reduce 10 percent , but what does that mean ?
this is going to be in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these stripes ?
there &apos;s a proof of the proof that men are not too .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is actually the <unk> components of the <unk> .
people about the urine .
yeah .
so rome , men can &apos;t be a pretty .
because this is what that &apos;s like , or ?
traditionally , we think we &apos;re in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many of the world .
and if you say , if you say , people can get to the people to engage it to the people , you would not have to be there , then they &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> .
and so as as somebody like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> than the human population .
in israel , you get a <unk> , if you &apos;re a <unk> , you &apos;re going to the earth .
here &apos;s the way that says , ever more you &apos;re better .
yeah .
the first question is , we are really too many ?
if you look at the ants that are weight on earth , then ants , then ants , then ants about five times more than humans .
i could also sell to the metaphorical , but in the united states , although they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that ants have more more than we are .
and because they talk about a lot harder than we work three three months , you &apos;re only three to three months , you know , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your weight , in
that means we don &apos;t have a too many , we are doomed to ?
and how much we wanted to do is how far we wanted to do really want to humanize and could see that we wanted to do really want to humanize and could see that we wanted to see that for example , can see that for example , to the 60 40 , to go here ?
you can only be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist ?
the only chance .
did you ever have seen a tandem tree ?
yeah ?
one single thing ?
this is what we mean , our whole intelligence means that we want to be more than trees , yes ?
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
not , yeah ?
there &apos;s no <unk> trees on trees .
there &apos;s been a lot of the <unk> in the midst of the trees .
you &apos;ve just heard some of the <unk> of trees ?
this means , all our intelligence means that we want to be as a more .
and where you see , even , even something like demeter , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> agriculture , no means that our own transportation .
each year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that would be in the academic literature .
and we &apos;re going to be a lot of time .
you know about it .
so we &apos;re focused on earth that we &apos;re saying , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and like all the hot <unk> .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe sense to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to reset our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about a big <unk> , the useful of the useful time .
we want to be good for the society , we want to be good for the environment , but if it &apos;s not that the highest is that it isn &apos;t there ?
<unk> , yeah ?
they can only have <unk> , if they &apos;re not there .
even if they shoot them , they would have been looking at .
so they can &apos;t solve the .
we can do it .
we can live our nutrients .
we &apos;re usually in brazil agriculture where we &apos;re going to eradicate the nutrients .
and we can apply the way we &apos;re doing this kind of way , and we &apos;re building nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re going to take place in china , where we take it right to the .
china is a <unk> of a <unk> , so , the hummingbird , now , right ?
and in our western world , we were always stupid , our social <unk> .
this is the entire western western <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that the city has never been something .
because of course , the cities are growing , because the farmers are farmers in cities , and cities had to bring more niches .
all of western nation are always worth , until they &apos;re always going to be more honest until they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
china was different .
you have <unk> civilization over years , because you always had always been able to get the nutrients <unk> .
even today , if you &apos;re faced for lunch , you &apos;re faced with the food , you &apos;re going to stay as long as they do the bathroom .
because it &apos;s bigger , and the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got to get them to eat , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see you can see the nutrients can .
the effect of the way that is beautiful , if you do that , you can make agriculture , and the facility that can make agriculture , and the facility that can make agriculture , and the facility that can make a farmer , and pig , and and fish and fish .
and the great thing about that is that the <unk> in the favelas &apos;s favelas in the favelas to absorb the favelas around the past percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , and they seemed to be bad .
we can support them support to be good .
this is natural <unk> , but the most unlikely people .
the belief is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed so designed by the design that can just be just a farmer .
this is what they go back to the <unk> .
and no one of these facilities , we &apos;ve been talking about <unk> , we don &apos;t have a <unk> , none of these assets , none of these facilities had ever been <unk> .
they could just just put a pint of a liter of <unk> <unk> and then the facility of the users .
wal-mart don &apos;t find no .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people , and educating it &apos;s a little bit bad .
we can support them support to be good .
this is , we need phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do something , you &apos;re just to best from all the best of all the indigenous aspects of all indigenous .
unfortunately , they don &apos;t seem to mock , but maybe you can help you the <unk> of the <unk> .
because the <unk> facility , the best <unk> .
and the need to return .
we see that phosphorus is really cool .
and we see that it &apos;s going to be .
we &apos;ve now entered three years now .
the the successful government has explained , you &apos;ll be the first country in the world .
but we need the overall .
understand , there &apos;s two countries that are the age of the <unk> world in the world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the percent of the <unk> .
and we &apos;ll replace replace replacing the other .
but you won &apos;t replace replace .
so that &apos;s not about that to make the existing point , but it &apos;s about making something really important .
and it &apos;s about trying to wonder what the right is .
this is , it &apos;s about efficiency efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you learn to do this , because in holland , the country on the flowers .
yeah ?
imagine if you have your wife , you know , your wife is , if you &apos;ve got them , you &apos;re going to have them and come back .
entirely inefficient .
but , and so , and do you know , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , three kilogram three kilogram three kilogram of their life .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re .
this is a scientifically , not exactly because because we don &apos;t know how much more likely to do .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and
a everything that lives in life beautiful , isn &apos;t efficient .
this is not an act , but it &apos;s exploding .
what &apos;s the right ?
not , the <unk> , a little better better and so , and it &apos;s going to compute the materials of the parameters , but first , first of the materials that you can do ?
so imagine what has changed .
yeah ?
if i say you to take them to the dinner and say , there &apos;s a <unk> with a <unk> and a glass water .
beautiful , social constellations ?
this is a lot .
everything , what &apos;s in life is beautiful , isn &apos;t efficient .
if you fall in somebody who &apos;s face ?
yeah ?
this is all , everything , what life is the life in life , isn &apos;t perfect to avoid the life .
the entire world &apos;s <unk> .
we say , we say , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have a look at the south .
no , the general is exactly the right ?
on each one , where you &apos;re <unk> , you know , you create a <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you glance , when you glance &apos;s <unk> , you &apos;ve got a <unk> .
in the way we think of north america .
there &apos;s all the footprint <unk> .
if you walk out , you know , every footprint is the ground .
because the ground is going to die in the palm , and the wind and the water is gone down .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every core , every core , that the water is longer in the heart .
so , it &apos;s about to create a big footprint that is a marsh .
not <unk> .
we &apos;re going to sustainability .
yeah ?
but if i ask them , when i ask them , you know ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i &apos;m saying , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
this is just the minimum .
so no , it &apos;s saving , avoid avoid .
everybody &apos;s <unk> .
and it &apos;s a proof where you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , and the <unk> of the car .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s the greatest code of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we have an <unk> <unk> that is the use of science liquid .
they can go to the <unk> where they go .
in two hours , they put everywhere .
and they &apos;re <unk> seeds from hundreds of plants , so they can freely .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there &apos;s two cycles .
not all of the <unk> .
a television or a machine that they use just only the use of the use .
just the things that bounce <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , how <unk> , who must be that they &apos;re going to go to biological systems .
the things that are just used to be used in technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yeah ?
for instance , the <unk> , yes ?
it &apos;s not direct advertising , and not for the company , they &apos;re not for the company , but they &apos;re helping this company , these products .
because we don &apos;t we do not things .
yeah ?
so , if i say , if i say , it &apos;s free to <unk> , it &apos;s free to you , you don &apos;t even try to do it .
no , we &apos;re stuck , what &apos;s going on .
smile .
so not like <unk> .
not consist .
it &apos;s all in common , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can smuggle to the <unk> <unk> , and the rubber puppet in biological laboratories , right ?
everything is <unk> .
and if it &apos;s us to do it , we appropriated to <unk> for <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> and the textile textile .
and this is the half of all the <unk> globally world , the textile industry .
you help them , you ask , you &apos;re going to get questions about the people .
hey , <unk> , power , power is really serious ?
because the implication of now , the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure sure if they really are really <unk> .
so , i want to get a little bit .
but it &apos;s going .
yeah .
what &apos;s just happening .
this is what this is .
we can make things that you can do that if you can manipulate if you &apos;re <unk> , you can go into biological .
technical <unk> , there &apos;s no way .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> .
this is the first enlightenment , actually , who is , is actually what is done in the circulation .
so , you know , you can see things that are <unk> .
if you come on the side , yes ?
remember , remember , the most frightening ?
if it &apos;s currently the trash .
everywhere , this <unk> , <unk> .
in the middle of the countries where people are coming to the money .
there &apos;s the <unk> , but otherwise , in the landscape , but otherwise , in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the autonomous of the plastics , so that it can be able to be able to melt on <unk> , so if we change the <unk> change can be able to put it with a baby in israel in israel or in tunisia trees .
yeah ?
you alone , if you take these together , they &apos;re getting <unk> , and the powder to plants get trees .
so , this is the baby <unk> for the entire life .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of like a <unk> <unk> .
yeah , .
yeah ?
we can do this .
we can reinvent all that again .
i got a <unk> in the institute .
meanwhile , they &apos;re working on there , many people , and they can all of them .
there &apos;s a <unk> of a <unk> club , where everybody wants .
so no longer , it &apos;s not saving , the <unk> , , no <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> waste .
does it curious ?
thank you .
the work of the sinaloa federation .
music is music .
in the 2008 , i wrote this , i &apos;m going to be a <unk> , so i &apos;m going to understand as a <unk> , so i understand .
<unk> are the most remarkable music in music music .
it &apos;s not just word word for word for word for word , but the deeper meaning in another language , but also the deeper meaning in another language , so everyone &apos;s going to hire it an useful translation , knows anyone who has to deal with .
so from the german to the english , it can also be a bit , it &apos;s actually when it comes to the fundamental relationship .
it &apos;s quite remarkable , but for what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i &apos;ve just begun the the same grades .
they think secure , the cut-off that the coast of exactly the same thing , what he remembered .
in fact , the notes is very concrete and <unk> .
these are about equivalently or <unk> , as a verbal , if also very seemingly neglected , description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of flowers are not smell of flowers , which is not to be not not too detached to the <unk> .
this is , the trial has to be these <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , concrete , concrete , concrete , concrete <unk> , concrete <unk> .
today , i want to show you what i &apos;m going to do is , so , <unk> , once again in a speech language .
so , the translation of translation .
so i &apos;m so why i tend to do the whole rather than german rather because when i was walking into english , it would be ready to retool me with translation .
so , the music thing works for me to the spoken way to the spoken way .
the smartest note , the function of the letters of a writing .
so it &apos;s not just trying to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to push the the piano or the right spot to hit a <unk> .
so , this would just be the letters that you &apos;ve learned from the way .
the point of letters you can only do if you can do the language .
so , we need to think about the process of music , like the spoken way to the spoken way .
there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn to the <unk> , you seek to learn to the <unk> , just like you can also actively be actively able to talk about the gps inch .
the work of the monkey starts hanging on the way of a <unk> .
after you start having a play demo , you &apos;re excited to play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to have a look at the emergence of the composition .
you &apos;re going information about the piece of the <unk> .
you read about the letters , <unk> , , , , notes , or it &apos;s words , thoughts from the space itself .
you studied the work that he was and he meditated on the .
you start looking at .
the <unk> writing writing .
how did he get the physical ?
how was his <unk> , how the society and politics ?
this is all interested in me .
you think about this , in this time , you think of paintings or literature .
but with the time , you also have a rich idea about the composers that you can play , and it &apos;s going to play a recipe , and it &apos;s going to feel like to feel like that .
the composer is increasingly more , you &apos;re going to live with you .
his desire to write the writing that play more and more and more to play it .
now , the notes all of the other things as an accurate form of the antibodies , but only one scaffolding , i would try to make this framework that &apos;s happening back to mind and meaning .
i &apos;m going to say , with my own words , what &apos;s between this framework .
i &apos;m going to show what the alternative could .
now for me , for me and for the long time , what they should mean for today .
each note , every communicator , which is a sense , because i &apos;m bulletproof because it &apos;s from my chest personally .
it &apos;s got to be <unk> in here and now , i can &apos;t argue that that &apos;s my cheese .
it &apos;s always been a very hard thing when i have to have sex , and the piece that i &apos;ve got to experiencing so long as new .
as you talk about a happy new day , although always always keep always the same thing in life , the same way , the way , the way i was , the way i can always build the same as a new .
i &apos;m a day , the seasons would go to seasons , my pulse , the pulse as a <unk> seal takes down the sound of a <unk> seal warehouse back to home .
i suppose the ted &apos;s breathing , or the absence of the audience .
all of the influenced me and all the impacts of my experience with the composition .
and quite wonderful , even though i go with a <unk> onstage on the stage and we have the same .
then , it &apos;s happening the same as a good , <unk> .
you give a new idea , and that &apos;s going to be able to do this .
it &apos;s exciting , because vitamin things we can &apos;t do that , and what you don &apos;t use specimens .
it makes big fun , to do this way , and you as the audience , as the music is alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this moment .
i can &apos;t play this as much as a shower .
i &apos;m going to have more more more than today and i &apos;m going to be about my palette of the <unk> <unk> , feelings and the stories today .
certainly , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> , but for all sorts of <unk> .
i have a nice thing to do .
it was a <unk> for a jewish old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , professor <unk> <unk> , professor <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so i decided to study when i finally grew up .
but i had fortunate enough to finish very early very early , and so i was on the waist , and so i was on his mental illness .
i was back to 17 robbins , when i was on a gravel back , and he was played the last of a <unk> of a <unk> of the four prime minister of <unk> , a <unk> .
he wondered what the introduction of this <unk> was for me .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
so there &apos;s the <unk> dancer , and he &apos;s going to be , and he &apos;s so ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , you know .
he was about the <unk> .
well , with the other hand , you had just dreams , but not a more rural .
i &apos;m going to play today about this piece of all of and i &apos;ve been struggling to do , even though it &apos;s not only a single thing .
every time you see , it &apos;s also an idea that , i &apos;ll end up a new .
one example of a different approach from a different section . that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but too different , , in <unk> light .
he has the <unk> <unk> , translated , as he said , as it was like , as she was going to do in this moment .
his <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a single name is this .
now i &apos;m also a minute when he wrote the piece of writing .
he has only lived in the 1950s .
and it &apos;s really important to watch that i can look back into the note , even if i can try to be able to stop them .
to keep <unk> , right with the twist .
because the notes are the only one .
especially , when he died .
now , how do you start to talk about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to be about equally as the spoken language .
often , the most popular thing is that you &apos;re learning to read the notes .
you learn to read the read the way , before you just speak a word .
you learn to learn to the sounds to the notes on the way .
if everybody wants to connect and really , really , as it is , then , then , then the sounds of notes , which are also the same way that they sound like music .
if the accurate happens , the students get the <unk> of the <unk> .
over the interpretation , not if you &apos;re not going to talk about the <unk> .
well , there &apos;s a <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> , slowly .
according to loud and <unk> , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s most of the ones here .
but also , as you get these disparate , it &apos;s just a bit more technical .
and yet it &apos;s not a interpretation .
i &apos;m going to illustrate my own .
i &apos;m not a look at some very <unk> , a very <unk> .
namely , in order to make music music , your musical musical and feel already should be present .
so , that &apos;s the .
a kid who was not supposed to learn because it couldn &apos;t be the parents , not the parents that it &apos;s not going to be .
this is like the <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to be necessary to all the way , his own experiences and idea of a more way to bring a more way to bring a more way to bring a more way to bring a sound .
people who never have been denied , has never immediately immediately immediately with the idea of your body , like it &apos;s a sound .
a phrase with his own way to designing their own breath .
the most powerful thing is the extension of our body .
our face-to-face , to boil our hands and the feet of dancing .
so the <unk> in the piano of my fingers .
the tune of the barn , from the <unk> and the rhythm .
the <unk> <unk> is the music is now not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to do more even more music , if it &apos;s boring .
no need to whistle a <unk> or a <unk> .
each of the most elemental music is going to be avoided , if you &apos;re going to be <unk> .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , but what do you have to fail to stop when i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention if i &apos;m going to mention
i &apos;m going to be able to sing , a b , because they think they can &apos;t be ?
or b , because they don &apos;t have to be able to go ?
and at two , it &apos;s not too late to find out if you can &apos;t manipulate them or learn how to learn these little muscles that are the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
you can train train .
or c , you &apos;re told them that they &apos;re <unk> .
i wonder how much <unk> is this clustering ?
have you ever seen a <unk> or <unk> , you know , you know ?
or d , they like no music and also want to make it available to do it .
what i would like to think about because music is , because music is a nice , <unk> .
but you may not have to be able to get them .
well , yes , so you see , you have to be a <unk> candidate candidate .
but don &apos;t tell you , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m going to tell you , but certainly can they tell you whether they fail or not .
because i don &apos;t think anyone , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m not going to do because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t eat a food , because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to pay attention to classical music , because they don &apos;t play the instrument .
listen to you and say , whether it &apos;s raining or not .
whether the music is inherently <unk> or too sweet .
tell what they &apos;re feeling .
and you &apos;re going to get more fruits and also something more shocking to replicate or even more or more or more eyeballs .
why am i asking you from my audience that it &apos;s active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
one of them never look at , you never have force force .
the food that &apos;s been a cook or a chef or a chef , has to be eaten , has got to be eaten or recipes .
so , you listen to the point if you &apos;re going to be a music .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if you &apos;re in a environment where the adult action is always going to be active music , a child , a child , is to hear a child , it &apos;s easy to ask what color has explained your flower ?
can you play me in the blue ?
and the kid plays a <unk> , instead of a red flower , instead of a blue flower flower .
and this is quite different than a .
this was the very first beginning of a musical musical cafe .
so the first step came to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of today , the originally originally today , or even before the amazon , 11 years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments are <unk> .
there was just a big thing as a mere street .
it wasn &apos;t invented .
i think the stream is , the stream is to be the <unk> of modern modern <unk> .
i can have the <unk> that the stream has had the stream , on the modern of modern <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> .
and i know you know , you know , he knows he was deaf .
today , today , a modern orchestra is able to play anything , which is a orchestra from the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of
so that &apos;s why the composers were labeled <unk> that frees the normal <unk> .
so they &apos;ll blow up what they &apos;re just in the field of the mind .
and what you might think about today .
or what i &apos;m going to switch today , because what they might think .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s going ?
did you ever be wondering ?
and how did this feel ?
wow .
i was a friend that drives a <unk> .
if i come to come from , you know , my little pieces of <unk> and so i &apos;m going to end up with my little pieces of <unk> and so that feeling this feeling .
i looked at the head of the head .
i &apos;m going to say , &quot; what do you get to do is you ?
the grandmother &apos;s been in the first half year half of his brain .
and all of you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , much less than i &apos;m .
why i have to afford to do this ?
and then i then cleared an idea that &apos;s .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say , what i &apos;m saying is this tiny feeling .
our organism has a great way to invent these words as just as a few emotions .
you can also try to get a little bit like <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today is something that &apos;s external about is probably familiar with .
the mechanism is from the lie .
but remember , you may have missed the lie , you may have heard if people say , if people say , no one has a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he &apos;s going to tell you the harry potter .
so on a lie , you see that the liars itself doesn &apos;t even know what he says .
it &apos;s called <unk> , hoping that it has to mind .
he just just just just just just to himself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about is that they &apos;re bouncing .
they need to need these lie to get a <unk> to get a a a way to get a straight .
they can &apos;t easily easily easily <unk> or even the locals .
you need time .
this is what the time , a anecdote that you might know .
biologist painter <unk> picasso &apos;s picasso , once spiked a woman .
this woman has been remembered , the portrait would not look like .
picasso come up , wait .
it &apos;s always becoming more .
and so on this point , and if you &apos;re laughing , you realize how important that is , and how much time you need to learn to experience something very good .
because artist has a <unk> ratio of the lie .
artist , you know , a little bit of the , and especially this lady , what they don &apos;t see if you just look at the mirror .
artist &apos;s a portrait of something that &apos;s going to be familiar with a gene with the same thing , if you look at this .
then , this weird feeling , it couldn &apos;t see them , and it &apos;s going to see them .
here you have this mechanism with the ideal as a great invention to unify the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not just in the art , in the <unk> , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology ,
you may know , maybe this idea of the dame that every morning in the mirror and asked every morning in the mirror and asked who &apos;s the most amazing in the country ?
one day say that , in this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and you know , as much hostility from this true gene , even the mirrors can &apos;t lie , from this true evolutionary contents .
but we should just simply make sure that you cannot say that there &apos;s a flexible somewhere in a woman somewhere there &apos;s a flexible somewhere in a different somewhere .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is what we understand is to understand what we &apos;re doing is always going to be .
we need to imagine what the tickle that we are eating deception that we can &apos;t even do .
we don &apos;t just react in the art , in the <unk> , but in science , such a great deal .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
they heard about this book , the origin of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the power of humans .
that human being <unk> , and , yes , it &apos;s got a common ancestor , at least a common ancestry between humans and apes .
and then they ran to her husband and said , that &apos;s not true what charles did , and i think that &apos;s not true what charles did .
the human is supposed to be <unk> or a common ancestor .
no , no , no .
and when it &apos;s true , we need to prevent that people &apos;s minds .
why do we need to prevent people to gain about something , when it &apos;s true ?
because we don &apos;t have these <unk> .
because we manage this together , this sense , the highest <unk> , a kind of <unk> <unk> , a kind of <unk> <unk> , a kind of <unk> <unk> , a kind of <unk> like a organism , and otherwise you know , this is for us .
so , we can &apos;t have a .
we need to prevent people to do things like things , when they &apos;re true .
so , you see how frightening to the same time and like the traces , he would be able to look at something different other than that , which he &apos;s going to do something different from ourselves , and i want to give you another story .
one of the most amazing story , like me .
my wife told me .
she came from school , she &apos;s coughing , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me from a student .
a <unk> learner students .
they may like like like , because he has a <unk> .
and so , you asked him what &apos;s your race ?
and since that , he says , well , well , i &apos;m going to be on the fire .
and because i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> things .
yes , you feel it , if you &apos;re <unk> , there &apos;s something that &apos;s not .
i &apos;ve been told my wife , always when a person in a moral puppet , the <unk> , which means we &apos;re trying to try to replace the <unk> .
let &apos;s take that , and then you have the sentence .
i also even though i &apos;m the fire , i &apos;m interested in lolcats .
they feel the actual truth behind the bottom .
so a little baby <unk> , who cares about no <unk> .
the most fundamental <unk> .
but there &apos;s no running , we can &apos;t learn how to learn where you learn from how to power .
there &apos;s only the same way that the fire .
and there &apos;s been concerned about .
and <unk> , you &apos;re not going to say , &quot; you don &apos;t have a cognitive point of innovation , and it &apos;s a way that when the fire gets <unk> .
no , it &apos;s just much better than we are , when we &apos;re going to show you that we are able to build others , which others can only create fire .
here &apos;s what you have this little bored .
this <unk> concern that in the middle of the <unk> , he knew that he actually has actually been actually with the fire that &apos;s actually going to say that .
here you have this <unk> between the and the conscious thing , without the immediately <unk> , without you can do something different , but the things that you can do something different from which they know , so they &apos;re much better for you and other .
so then just admitting that words that we &apos;re also in the language of political consumption , continuously continuously .
we know , something else is the case .
but we know , when we &apos;re going to say , we &apos;re very delicate devices .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to be able to perform things in a society that &apos;s going to work .
i want to talk to you what we found in the institute .
after the logic , these environments , these environments , another reality that we &apos;ve actually already in the case than the that we know that they &apos;re thinking about , looking forward to spread .
so i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is what many of you know , which many of you know , some of them , quite few people .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so communicable , is about .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about <unk> , nature &apos;s nature .
and if you have people who are the most important belief they &apos;ve been so much belief that they &apos;ve been so much , they &apos;ve been so meat from meat and blood , something <unk> , a <unk> framework , they &apos;ve been just given to the earth , they just look like , on the earth , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then , from this soul , they &apos;re sort of doing this in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> , <unk> , in the latin , <unk> , in the latin , <unk> , which is present in latin america .
and if this <unk> , the people &apos;s <unk> , then it &apos;s filled with spirit , with nature , with nature , with nature , just life can be reduced with nature .
and then he can just acquired the <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul .
so they &apos;re going to be about people .
so we should perceive as something , what was necessarily for our lives .
and if you have these skills , they understand the logic that we can experience this fortune , through a a lie to improve a a lie to improve
because now you can use a <unk> .
<unk> , they know from school .
this is now a <unk> that &apos;s going to try us a logic .
this is the way of hardest part of my talk .
here you need a logic , but also the willingness to lie .
so , they &apos;re tuned , they can use this logic .
in this <unk> , three sentences .
the first sentence is , <unk> , there are no soul .
so the second set of the time , if you &apos;re right , it didn &apos;t have a soul .
now , there &apos;s a third set of the third sentence .
i have him here .
a third set of the time , the world &apos;s going to be the strong feeling for a soul .
and the say , who has no soul , which is dead and it can &apos;t affect the .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic in this room , yes , in this <unk> speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sides sentences that are varied .
i can can say anything .
the logic makes no written about the reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , then the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , you know , there &apos;s not a man .
the analytics is not telling us what about .
i can browse anything .
but if i &apos;m right , if i &apos;m right .
so , if you say , if you say , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he has right , he didn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are different species .
and now , in terms of <unk> minds , immediately , it can make something .
it depends on a third set of sentence that nothing has to do with the first two two , and the way that , as if the opposite of the first sentence of the first sentence of the first sentence , and it &apos;s the way .
because we &apos;ve also learned to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with that logic that it just simply just makes it just to be effective phototherapy , and a third <unk> , who looks like , so we can save our <unk> , who looks like , &quot; can we save our <unk> .
so we do that , as if it &apos;s impossible to contribute without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can collect these things like different examples .
in the present tense , we have a completely example that binds the <unk> .
so , they need to talk to another subject of philosophy , a <unk> of philosophy .
this has led to do with it , that we were going to bring back into the <unk> century .
there was a <unk> who was called the <unk> <unk> and after the course of the <unk> .
biologist is a beautiful , a beautiful thing that &apos;s inherently to nature &apos;s natural nature .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is a <unk> .
and if you go the exact same thing in the middle of two decommissioned , then he &apos;s going to be <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know , he &apos;s first first .
so he &apos;s in the middle .
so these are the <unk> .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s nothing nothing .
just if you take another example , they don &apos;t need to be the a source of the a source , and if you don &apos;t need bedrock , no reason reason and nothing .
automatically run to the right mind .
so if you have these idea that you will sort of idea that you will see , <unk> , by the larger , by the larger , by a time , they also have quickly the feeling that it has to be like a free seat .
and when we &apos;re in here , i remember the <unk> slope on the <unk> , then remember the <unk> .
there &apos;s a bunch of state , the <unk> <unk> , and then you &apos;re sometimes wolf <unk> , and then you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can form the second set of the sentence and can say , when wolf <unk> right , then he didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are totally different and <unk> .
and what we read in daily daily now , read , they find in this third set .
this looks about this , who has no animators , can &apos;t have any <unk> unless its actions , and not to be the responsibility , and he &apos;s an amazing thing .
and here you have it again .
actually , actually , you have to prove whether it &apos;s like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this , as if the first sentence of the day , as a result of the <unk> without needing without the opposite .
and now you can just do if they want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially especially people happy when they want to do happy , and that &apos;s like , if they want to make people happy , that &apos;s the audacity to the bar .
practice , if you think , if you think of you , if you say , you can say , they can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please use the german word for the <unk> system , which is the prophet .
they don &apos;t mention what that would be a little bit politically politically politically .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
you can be a to the current of the , for the rest of these solar flares , and you can &apos;t prove .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
because whilst you &apos;re busy with , you &apos;re looking at it , you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man &apos;s man .
it &apos;s quite happy about it , because he has led to you .
because he was sitting on a <unk> , he himself not going to fail .
because actually , this guy isn &apos;t interested in this person .
it &apos;s just interested in the very interested , wondering himself , prove that there &apos;s <unk> .
so , in the way the shift of the <unk> , they &apos;re the most fundamental experience of the lie .
and if you have a possibility of a way to feel that <unk> into other people , they &apos;re going to do it because they &apos;re going to do other people when they &apos;re not talking about their <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i i loved asked , i asked asked , &quot; if i was going to be .
she &apos;s one of the most controversial <unk> here , and i &apos;ve asked asked to ask me , whether i put this talk here and my idea .
i need to say , you &apos;ve got to say it , it &apos;s helped me hard to talk about my idea .
and i may think my <unk> is i &apos;m going to announce you .
but it &apos;s natural , very many ideas , very many ideas .
i &apos;m going to start thinking about the two girls , i &apos;m going to be a lot of bright <unk> for this bad <unk> acts in <unk> , <unk> , , because i was <unk> to study in <unk> , <unk> , , <unk> , today , i think , &quot; i think , &quot;
and then i went to the course , i went to berlin , because i was destroying renewable medical and renewable energy and the <unk> of the <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> was all <unk> <unk> , including <unk> <unk> .
the hot <unk> is the <unk> .
because an interesting engineer has been built by cars , or <unk> .
but it &apos;s like &quot; n <unk> , from the kind of a hundred watts from the foot of the foot , that was a toy toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m an <unk> footage that he &apos;s the word again because after the <unk> , you know , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use more because everything was bad .
and it was not that in the <unk> .
there was so that there was so that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them in <unk> in <unk> , where you were killing .
the place of the sinaloa federation , but this was been called <unk> and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
and yeah , a lot of what today was told me , and i turned to me , because many of the great <unk> were that i &apos;ve been .
i &apos;ve been working in the field of the field of the field that was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one says , if a no time has been a fully <unk> , i &apos;ve always wondered hard for a <unk> thing , because also all of his colleagues may really <unk> a <unk> thing , because they might really hard for me , because all of his friends always have , you &apos;ve got the money laundering to your ears in your kid .
it &apos;s busy with a video .
and this was really , very <unk> , and then you come down in this way , you get asked , and then i &apos;ve been asked to go after 10 years , thousand <unk> were that , in the last time , a thousand <unk> were , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the field of time , if that was really going to be the great thing .
and i then went down to <unk> <unk> and then we have focused on the friends with friends , i &apos;m an <unk> of company <unk> that then with the <unk> <unk> of one of the largest <unk> of the world &apos;s largest <unk> of the world .
but since we &apos;re talking about , but because of course , the problem of a growing and we have this problem of the future , decided that we start to start small , and we &apos;ve got a little group that people will say , it &apos;s just crazy , we decided that people say , what &apos;s going on , that people say , what &apos;s all the way that we don &apos;t talk about .
and i &apos;ve got a project that i &apos;m going to show you .
and the title of the talk was , as you get older percent renewable .
and we just just start with a relatively sensible convenient story where i could start to ask where you could deploy a memory element today .
on this island , this island , this is the island of the microchip .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s a thousand people .
and that &apos;s a nigerian application of the atlantic 15 percent .
and the question is , why haven &apos;t they have no more ?
that &apos;s not just well-being .
if you throw more <unk> , it &apos;s catching the system .
and i &apos;m going to talk about politicians , when you &apos;re secreted to <unk> our facility .
so , that &apos;s always why ?
we have been added percent in germany .
no problem .
but not , we &apos;re not talking about seven percent , and our net is the european food system .
if we were in europe , we &apos;ve had the same problem that would have been the same problem that people have on this island .
the question was just , that was <unk> , the first of the island of the island , the first of the island of the island of the island , the way , but just by the island .
how big needs a battery that &apos;s been so a battery , the island , , , , , , , , , , , , , maybe millions of renewable renewable renewable .
and yeah , i go , go back to a <unk> .
the limbic system looks like all around the world .
by the way , a few hundred <unk> into the world , on <unk> <unk> in the world .
this is the performance of a hundred yards , because that &apos;s going to be everywhere .
the <unk> of the world , the <unk> , with diesel because you don &apos;t need to have a commitment .
that &apos;s fast .
you &apos;re going to be like this .
and then it &apos;s looking at the time .
in the midst of the <unk> , three of the <unk> , two will always live .
yeah , this is what &apos;s called the bottom there is the load down .
we &apos;ve also have done this very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , it &apos;s also a <unk> system , it &apos;s also a <unk> system , which is only in small amounts of here .
our goal was just to say , okay , okay .
the chamber is <unk> , and the wind , the wind , the load of the load , they can be able to map the bigger .
and if you go to 30 years , 30 percent per year , so , energy per year , not the achievement , not the achievement , then you have to move your <unk> .
this is what you need to do is that the renewable energies that renewables can achieve the entire network .
so , they can only do if they &apos;re in some kind of stuff .
this has been so no one on the world .
so this is the little style , so they can put in the car of a small <unk> .
people ask me , what do you do , what do you do in the <unk> ?
that &apos;s what this is .
if you want to get several of these <unk> and the trends , the <unk> , then , it &apos;s going to be complicated .
and our goal was we wanted to go back to the hills to the percent renewable and then the rest of the last 10 renewable , and then the rest of the last 10 renewable , september the last one , the last 10 , 15 percent of the last 10 renewable renewable , and that &apos;s not work that you &apos;re making it out of batteries .
this is going to be a decade , which is hydrogen , methane , methane , methane , methane , methane , methane , but it will be it will be it .
you have to go to a <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going to know what &apos;s going to happen , <unk> <unk> .
how far you do you get talking about ?
and then a whole lot of simulations .
and the load of the sun and sun and the load and the load and then came down to the conclusion , a very exciting thing that you &apos;re facing towards the <unk> system , which is about fifty consumption per hour , about <unk> cents .
this was the first thing about six years ago .
then we said , okay , okay .
well , yeah , we have a business model .
we are cheaper , if the feed five percent a year .
and then we started to guide with the geneticists .
what should they do ?
i was investors with investors , i &apos;ve got new <unk> .
we were just five people to build five people to innovate .
and here &apos;s what the representation .
the brown is the way the limbic system , is the green system is our system .
and our system also has a <unk> , that we &apos;ve got a 70 percent with the gas and a <unk> on the other things that are not <unk> .
and the <unk> that the <unk> of the <unk> on the island , we &apos;ve got to be really cool .
but we want to support , but we don &apos;t think you don &apos;t believe that their technical problem .
and so , we have a medical hall in berlin , we &apos;re going to look at the electrical brain , in which we can do the electrical brain to three , right .
that means we have this first note , the largest <unk> of the world .
here &apos;s the way here is .
the only one of asia , in the stomach .
and <unk> is in recent years old , in bbc , today , <unk> , has been developed in food , and then <unk> <unk> .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very big .
she has a power , and can bring six hours of a performance , and this is the battery that we have to have a <unk> <unk> .
and then they have .
we also have a <unk> in the same size , like , in the same size , the complete dynamic behavior of this network , so that &apos;s the complete dynamic behavior of this network , so it &apos;s the complete dynamic of this network , here &apos;s the big <unk> that we &apos;re going to simulate the network .
over here , we &apos;ve crossed the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to sort of <unk> , the <unk> of the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we also can sprinkle <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the grid .
so here we see here again , we &apos;re seeing this again , here &apos;s the ones , here &apos;s the entire , <unk> .
and what we did was that we had been done since then , for <unk> , everything here , everything else was between the <unk> system , software between the <unk> system , and we did .
so we are not misguided , but we &apos;re going to define ourselves as a company that only is just between the subject and the subject and everything .
you have to communicate , of course , you also need to communicate and also can communicate also , and it &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty of the subject that you have to look at everything that we &apos;ve ever moved to the <unk> , which we will get to get our <unk> unless we want to increase our crops .
so this whole discussion , like this is going to be a moment in the moment , and <unk> , <unk> , how to do the way that you should go to march , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> <unk> <unk> offers <unk>
so , <unk> , a <unk> .
we can start on the isle of rome , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you can get load load .
that &apos;s what you see , if you &apos;re at least 90 percent renewable , you won &apos;t get without storage .
you can read through the n of the <unk> , yes , that should be through the bed , that should be through any case , that should be avoided , but you can never break to find an memory bar .
and this is like , &quot; the message is the message .
so , you also have lots of people , and look at the time , you can see what you &apos;re seeing .
if we reverse the diesel race , you &apos;ve got to have no more choice , which is causing a certain amount of learning .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just showing from the very often south africa where the wave of big <unk> , where there &apos;s only the wave around the wave around the universe .
we look at this network , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
this is the system .
and of course , the incredible thing is that unbelievable .
if you throw the <unk> <unk> , it takes the time .
the <unk> was at least 10 seconds to keep the net .
and you can react to another .
if you don &apos;t have more to have more likely , you have to replace the <unk> with the <unk> and <unk> .
and we can take this big battery , two milliseconds .
and then there &apos;s a corresponding string of the enormous mechanisms there .
and the message is now , we need to get to these questions , when we &apos;re looking at these trends , 30 percent , and , less than that , thirty percent , and so on , if we want to do that , if we want to get to all the way .
then we have to put our <unk> on the net tables .
so , <unk> is simply just showing the power plant to hold the frequency .
yeah , this is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because we don &apos;t have otherwise , or <unk> , because we don &apos;t have a rising or <unk> , because that &apos;s not going to go .
and we &apos;re trying to make you that you can make the capacity , the <unk> , by looking at the <unk> in the net .
there &apos;s now , there are also a whole lot of studies .
and then , people get always and see our <unk> on the , and look at our <unk> on the ground , and look at our <unk> on the ground .
and yeah , the discussion always is always going to be the question , how far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far future , you can <unk> a piece of future .
and many discussions i had been six years , which i had been able to have been earth-like , were earth-like , which i had been working on the last 30 years to the last decade .
not , is insanity , , is insanity , <unk> , we &apos;ve gone everything , that &apos;s never .
we have now in the wild today in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i just just just like to learn that we &apos;re going to the next 30 years , the same capacity of <unk> in the world .
it &apos;s just a simple thing that &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a whole lot of <unk> and brothers .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been working now in the last decade now , that the scientists are going to ask my side .
we &apos;ve been talking about 10 million dollars , including the <unk> , to <unk> the grid .
this is going to be in the next april .
so , you see , you see that there &apos;s a change that there is a change and it &apos;s just from this <unk> , to the idea , 100 percent renewable .
and if you &apos;ve got a hundred renewable renewable , then it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so , in discussions , it &apos;s trying to try to try to <unk> these <unk> , which are woven , which has to do with our <unk> .
the question is just simply just when you do is just like , if you &apos;re fully independently , you know , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re on the world and become <unk> , they &apos;re a island .
then they only understood what the sun and wind there , where they live .
and this is a bit of the <unk> , and i &apos;m also <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;m also thankful that they have said , &quot; why they said , &quot;
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is , what we &apos;re doing , and then , the addition of <unk> <unk> , that you might be able to get an observation and make an equal way to get an observation and make an equal way to do and make a little bit together .
and yeah , i want to encourage you to encourage you to encourage you to do , in which you &apos;re going to be a little bit and a vision .
and you really need to stay really <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to go .
thank you .
when steve , the <unk> , the world was the first step through the streets of los angeles , went through the streets of los angeles , he said , a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a african-american , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , homeless , homeless , homeless , which only had two strings .
many of you will know the story about <unk> articles , because of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> junior junior <unk> , with robert <unk> junior <unk> , the <unk> , who was <unk> <unk> junior <unk> , who studied this <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , his genital mutilation was kicked by his <unk> .
nathaniel <unk> , a <unk> and 30 years later , and 30 years later , he lived as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the heart of los angeles .
i strongly recommend all of the <unk> book , so , they don &apos;t just see the lovely , so how the music can reveal the very nature that helped these two men , and how they ended up discussing the instrument that these are like the music that they communicate and how they ended up the instrument , nathaniel <unk> from the road .
i was the years of 2008 , in 2008 , two years ago , in the <unk> northwest hall .
he had just a demo from the night and the end of the onstage , and i came behind the stage to me .
he spoke in a very <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and about how to create a <unk> , and how never never going to create a myth that would be able to create the first compress in the last several years of beethoven .
we came to talk about the subject , and then a few days later , i got a email , in the state that perform nathaniel <unk> himself for a <unk> to me .
i must mention that nathaniel treatment , a medical treatment , because he was confronted with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> treated , a trauma that would have been that , a a a a a a a a a a a a a <unk> that has been done .
and as a result , it &apos;s especially vulnerable to these users for these users are so bad , and he &apos;s sometimes driving the streets of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s going to <unk> the streets of its own minds .
and in just a very <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , when we were with our first <unk> in the <unk> northwest hall , he had this little <unk> <unk> in his eyes , his eyes and <unk> .
he spoke about invisible and alex and how someone someone wanted to contaminate him in the domain olympics .
i mean , not <unk> , but i was afraid i could lose his relationship in one of his life , and i could put his relationship to the family , when i was able to destroy the child , when i was talking about <unk> and other exciting forms of the <unk> <unk> .
so i started playing with play .
i played the first set of beethoven <unk> .
and as i was playing , i was hoping that in <unk> eyes , a different change .
it was like , he was under the wheel of a little black hole , a chemical reactions that was really designed my game .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in understanding , in understanding of the quiet and <unk> .
and as a miracle he took his home , his violin and started to play after the home of golf and asked me to play them , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started talking about music , from the stream of bach , , , , , , , , , , <unk> , <unk> and all the rest of <unk> <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he couldn &apos;t just know a <unk> of music , but it was not just a strong personal relationship .
he was talking about her passion and a understanding that i just had just educate my colleagues in the <unk> of the <unk> of los angeles .
by the music , it was talking about music , was the <unk> of los angeles , <unk> man was just walking through the streets of los angeles , <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in 1968 .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for nathaniel , music means music is going to health .
because the music allows him to him his thoughts and delusions with help and creativity and creativity .
and so he &apos;s <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that this is exactly the idea of art .
so this is why we do we do music : we should do something that we all , in our artistic , our artistic view , our artistic sense of our artistic , can transform our creativity through the action .
and the reality of all the expression of all , and moving and the <unk> .
what &apos;s going uh , so , it took him back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music has been going to be back into a family of musicians who are minds , the ones that are being understood , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to be back to nathaniel bites , whether they &apos;re in the <unk> hall or in <unk> hall , because he was reminded me why i &apos;m going to become a deal with why i &apos;m going to become .
thank you .
<unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something called i <unk> the <unk> .
i hope you punch forgive me .
so i &apos;ve got a lot of the fish .
i just ate two big .
this first one , that was more like a passionate .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a little bit of the menu .
what &apos;s going on a fish .
even better , it was written in <unk> , the <unk> of sustainability <unk> .
so you could feel it .
i had this beauty of several months .
one day called the head of the company , and i asked , if i could be able to make a a surprise about the sustainability of the immunity .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve the unimaginable problem for our own , is it &apos;s like , how do we retain fish on our webpage ?
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean as we &apos;ve been doing .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing .
so , you might be <unk> or <unk> , some of our future .
many of the arguments are spinning against the environment , most of them , most of them , most of them , and they are inefficient , we take a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 15 .
this is , 15 pounds of <unk> <unk> are necessary 15 pounds of that you get chopped down .
not very sustainable .
not very well .
so here was a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to join them .
i called the day , the head of the front door , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call it .
&quot; don &apos;t we said , &quot; i said , &quot; i just just to make the facts right , so far as far as far as far as they couldn &apos;t find the environment . &quot;
&quot; the true is , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out there , it &apos;s not . &quot;
and then he &apos;s added , &quot; we &apos;re in a own world .
this <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> , great .
&quot; <unk> , one what &apos;s going to ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable <unk> , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and in this evening , i was in bed and thought , what is hell is a system that &apos;s a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , soon at the next day , he was looking at the table .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t know what to sustainable <unk> ? &quot;
he said , he said , he &apos;s going to be able to be able to get out .
well , i &apos;m going to people with a few people in the company , no one could give me an answer to the <unk> .
let &apos;s call it .
&quot; don &apos;t i said , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable protein ? &quot;
now , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> <unk> , and then he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , skin , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much more percent is <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
in the remaining , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said . &quot;
i said , &quot; what &apos;s sustainable to fish , the west coast of fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the helicopter and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just a lot of chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to quote from this fish .
no , no because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s even .
no , i &apos;ve got a <unk> of this fish , because i &apos;m sorry with god , which fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish ,
this second fish , this is a different kind of idea .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you can do , you &apos;re going to learn to reconnect , ever known as the fish that will take the fish .
i sent him first in <unk> stimulators .
a <unk> journalist had been known for an undergraduate of this fish .
she &apos;s got virtually <unk> .
he came to the table with a regular , almost <unk> <unk> suit .
the chef had to be <unk> .
redwoods .
sadly , he was still being respected .
who can make a fish like this , after he &apos;s going to be <unk> ?
i can &apos;t grasp it , but this guy can be .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . we &apos;re actually <unk> .
and no , he &apos;s not prime , and it &apos;s not a chef . at least revolutionized the way that you see .
it &apos;s a biologist of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner .
it &apos;s the most of the pollution of the river .
and to the hills , the county was <unk> .
they were <unk> on what was essentially fucking .
they were doing the way the land .
they built this complicated string of the , and they rebuilt water from the land and throw water into the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t make that the that , not economically .
and it &apos;s been a catastrophe .
it was about 90 percent of the birds around what &apos;s going to be many of the birds .
and so this is 1982 , with the road , the road the land .
what did they do ?
they have the river of the water bar .
they literally literally <unk> the lever .
instead of water , they used water to the water , to the water .
they <unk> the canals .
they created a zillion <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and his company destruction will completely <unk> .
the county is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything else .
they &apos;re rigid out of the horizon , the one million miles away from the horizon , and all of you see , and all of you see is <unk> channels and this <unk> , lush .
i was there , not quite long time with <unk> .
he &apos;s a incredible guy , three parts charles and a part of a crocodile , &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? because there were we and we got to the <unk> , and i <unk> , and i <unk> , and i &apos;ve got to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in a <unk> .
this is called a <unk> <unk> .
now , he &apos;s mentioning the <unk> .
and here &apos;s a pattern of babbage footage that &apos;s going to demonstrate that .
it turns out that the most of his career in the midwest of his career in the midwest of his career in the midwest of asia in the midst of the <unk> in the midwest .
i asked him how it became a <unk> .
he said , &quot; i know , &quot; fish ? i know nothing about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes to more about rare surfaces and algae and algae and <unk> .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was written on this <unk> piece of <unk> i i had to be the <unk> .
so i made him a little bit of it . i said , &quot; <unk> , it &apos;s going to be like your fish right ? &quot;
he pointed on the algae .
&quot; i know , young , the algae , the <unk> , the relationships that &apos;s incredible .
but what food does your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
now he said he &apos;s got to tell me that it &apos;s so a rich system that the fish are eating fish , what they would eat in the wild .
the russian biomass , the <unk> , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish are .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food food .
the one of you ever heard that they didn &apos;t get around the animals ?
i went on this site , and i asked him , i got to say , &quot; for a place that would like to be , &quot; for a place that would like , unlike one place , of course , unlike a place , &quot; how do you do ? &quot;
and it was a moment that it was a <unk> .
and we collected the corner of the corner and <unk> and thousands of thousands of tiles , thousands of thousands of <unk> , a literally <unk> , a literally <unk> , a literally <unk> , a literally <unk> , a literally <unk> .
&quot; this is what is called &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; look at her <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , isn &apos;t you your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of the skin and <unk> .
well , last year , last year , we went to this site , more than 250 different different species .
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private health crisis in the whole .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> doesn &apos;t have the last <unk> <unk> , that you want to have a good ending system ? &quot;
he &apos;s been <unk> his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> is the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the ears .
so the more of the gut better better system system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s do this , a reputation that your animals wouldn &apos;t have to open their success on their own measures .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , oh , and by the way , these vectors are not going to be there .
they &apos;re breeding in a city where the <unk> is better than the <unk> movement .
every morning , they &apos;re going to launch the last mile .
and everybody &apos;s a burning fly flying the 240 .
they &apos;re doing because they &apos;re the <unk> white line line .
seriously in the seriousness .
i had a kind of journey of the penguins of penguins , so i looked at the <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly to 240 miles away , flying them to the wounds and fly it rigorously ?
do you make this for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , as i was just a a a <unk> of the whitney .
he said , &quot; no . they do that , because the food better better better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have the skin of my jaw , the delicious was , and i don &apos;t like a <unk> . i don &apos;t like a <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i never going to be able to get almost never .
and yet , when i read in this restaurant , they didn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
she liked them , and you &apos;ll see as if you take a bites trip .
i mentioned the day , and he &apos;s going to <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last shot before something in the body .
she has developed the evolution of evolution , to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added himself , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a a farm that didn &apos;t shove their fish . a reputation that measures the success measures of the success .
and then i realized , if he says , &quot; if he says , a dancer that no <unk> , he has become <unk> , because the water that &apos;s going through the river of the river .
it &apos;s a river that all the things that are designed to do with the rivers today , but with us chemical pollutants , the <unk> .
and when it was through the system , the water has clean water , than like it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a a farm that your health care providers , not just a a time that you have a <unk> , but a reputation , not just to be a a a a a a a a a a a a a of a <unk> , but for you and me .
because if the water goes down , <unk> it in the atlantic .
one in the ocean , i know , i know , i know , and that should also make it because these things are always because these are also the same as romantic and also .
you could say that you &apos;re an recipe for the future of the future , whether we &apos;re going to talk about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from a commodity new concept of agriculture , from a commodity in the food .
but for many people , this is a bit of the .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re also lover .
we love <unk> . we love small <unk> . we love little <unk> . we eat the food .
and if you say that the things are there , the future of good food are responding to somebody else &apos;s somewhere here and says , &quot; hey , people , i &apos;m going to <unk> the world ?
how do you feed the world ? &quot;
shall i be honest ?
i like this question .
no , no , no , because we produce enough calories to feed the world &apos;s the world .
one billion people are starving today .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- due to <unk> claims , not the <unk> .
well i like this question not because they &apos;re the logic of our <unk> over the last 50 years .
in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , chemicals , chemicals , chemicals , chemicals , chemicals , chemicals , chemicals , chemicals , the whole of just asked , &quot; if we feed more people should be cheaper , how do that be done ? &quot;
this was the thing . it was the -- it was the the killing of the american agriculture .
we should call them what she is in a <unk> , a perfect , a perfect , a <unk> , a perfect <unk> system that &apos;s happening right .
this is not a $ mirror , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is the endangered now , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of the resources resources , but because of <unk> resources , but because of <unk> resources , it &apos;s because of <unk> resources , but because of <unk> resources , resources resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by the country <unk> , not replaced by <unk> water , not through the pumps , not through the pumps , not through <unk> , but by the way , not by <unk> and nets , but recycled by fish in the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ?
or better , can we create conditions that every week to feed themselves ?
to do that , look at the <unk> of the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
facebook and machines are laying on the <unk> and never machine has never produced something really good to eat .
let &apos;s look at the opportunity model .
this is the thing that &apos;s on two billion years of <unk> <unk> .
look at the <unk> , look like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the ones that are not worlds are not worlds are <unk> , which serves the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> mountains , <unk> , not only experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts for the time .
and if i really is honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m going to be .
you know , i &apos;m right because when the future is good food , you will be be being delicious .
thank you .
if i want to tell you today , it &apos;s the sum of data , we want to think about it &apos;s the sum of your work and instead of thinking about why we can use the better than the sum of your leg , and we can &apos;t recognize that patterns , the otherwise otherwise seemed to be .
so , what we see here is a typical sample of old age .
the program that i &apos;m going to use is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do is that i can filter , to a specific hierarchy , we say we accidents .
and instantly , i see another pattern that &apos;s happening .
and because in the <unk> room here , the people are facing the <unk> , they &apos;re over here .
we can new step further , and the palestinian and the palestinian and the palestinian and the data , the usual suspects they are easy to everybody suspects , but not for everybody .
so , if we see , when we &apos;re looking at the age , we &apos;re going to see that accidents is actually actually the most profound to be the foundation of the obesity is the foundation of the obesity is supposed to be concerned about the people .
and who &apos;s seeing that <unk> is that they &apos;re particularly angles in men .
so they realize that the edges of information and data in this way , in this way , in this way , in a lively augustine .
and if we can &apos;t think that , why not what content is not to content for content ?
so what we &apos;ve been the <unk> <unk> every single <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who had ever printed .
it &apos;s all right here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it , in your new test .
with onboard , you can put in a decade .
you can &apos;t get into a corporate class .
you can jump right to a particular problem .
so , if i look at the <unk> , i see the <unk> that appear and the <unk> .
i &apos;m an lucky armstrong fan fan , so i &apos;m going to show you all the time in the lance armstrong .
now , if i want to get a <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i do anything about the subject ? &quot;
so i go back step back and forth the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get one idea about how to make information that if you can make a kind of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t just want to just say or not just the <unk> .
you do something that actually is actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between between between between and how information can be used .
so i want to think this idea now is a bit more about that is about what is a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve here is we &apos;ve done is , we have a little <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be a little nugget .
the summary is a quick sample of a quick cell for the time you get .
i just just just just just just just just want to <unk> the top of the <unk> .
but even in this case , we can do a lot of things .
now , we get a glimpse of the subjects of the topics that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to vote the subject .
well , after i &apos;ve chosen to i voted on the <unk> that most of the most commonly <unk> , which is located on the most likely <unk> &quot; people &apos;s most free <unk> .
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single frame .
this is just once you click a step and the entire .
i can then put a particular of these rides , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; people &apos;s time , &quot; and all together .
so , if i think all these people , i realize that the majority of the most important is from science , some of the most critical of the science , some of the science of the science , some of my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono , a ted prize winner winner .
so we can put on now , and we look at all the ted conference winner .
you see , we &apos;re brown surfing the first time , as a net really hot , not just a net , but much so much .
and so i want to show you what else is going to be a little bit of surprise .
i just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just going to show you the new york times .
<unk> , this -- i don &apos;t want to call it -- it &apos;s not a technological , but it &apos;s really not a technological , but you can look at this <unk> website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and directly directly to a specific <unk> .
this is why that &apos;s why because you only learned about the only way of websites in this way , the whole <unk> , the same way to the same way .
so i can actually do in my body in a specific .
here &apos;s the state of the patient &apos;s all demonstration that i &apos;ve got to the back .
and i can sort of like anything i looked like , again , again .
and if i take a step back and everything , i can violate my laptop new science , i can violate my laptop science fiction , here , i &apos;ve got to the <unk> &apos; right now , i &apos;ve color-coded about here , here &apos;s <unk> , here &apos;s <unk> , right here , or here &apos;s the live .
and then , i can put them back into the side , and she &apos;s going to go .
it &apos;s a metaphor which is dipping , and every time the bigger bigger than the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar of the manuscript .
we talk about the information in information .
what if we could come together , so that we could take these situation and the internet , so that we can go to many things to others , and to many things , and so that we can recognize patterns that would recognize what otherwise would be ?
if we can do this , then these practices <unk> , maybe this this is a new source of information .
and , instead of just trying to move in order to move in order to move .
and if we know , if we know , we can perhaps even <unk> <unk> .
i hear i , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> club .
in my home , i went to school , every day a hour a hour a hour .
and my nose always had always been always fighting in a book , a <unk> that my thoughts in other worlds and my thoughts in my <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and this curiosity , it turns out that i was always when i was in school , and chip and snakes and bugs and bugs and beetle and bugs and beetle and bugs and underneath everything , everything home and underneath everything , and underneath the microscope .
i was totally frantic , you know .
it was always to start the trial , the world and the bounds of the kind of possible .
and my love is 35 to science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late 60s , flew back to the moon and the deep .
jacques , in our room with his amazing his fascinating , the animals that animals and locations and locations and a world of wonder we could imagine before .
this has been quite good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s not video games on video games , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the the pictures of the media lab , i had to create the visuals of the visuals in my head .
we had to all the time . when we read the description of the <unk> , we took the <unk> description of the <unk> and the canvas in our minds .
my response to draw the drawing , and they prefer to drawing the painting of aliens , robots , <unk> and all of the things that .
in the <unk> , i was constantly constantly influenced by teachers , like i was like , &quot; wow , <unk> .
the creativity had to be built .
and this is something interesting . what was going on me to explores african <unk> around the idea of <unk> , was the idea of the idea of the world was completely unknown world on earth himself .
i would certainly have never really big <unk> in a charity , and that seemed really unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually could actually see the earth , and she was just as fascinating and the exotic as i had imagined as i read this books .
so i decided i was going to be 15 .
the only problem with that , i was in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the next several months ago .
i didn &apos;t let me feel guilty about .
i mean , i mean , he finally split a <unk> in her , new york , had made a <unk> in buffalo on the other side of the border where we lived .
i took my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter in buffalo in buffalo , new york .
the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later , when we were california after california .
since then , in 40 years , the most effective <unk> are <unk> , i &apos;ve got about three years , 500 hours of this in <unk> .
and i learned that the world is the world of deep ocean , even in the <unk> , the <unk> ocean , as we can really imagined .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t have a limit of borders , in contrast to our own human imagination .
to liberate for today , for the most awe days , what i consider to my <unk> .
and my love is the ocean , the ocean , with the same intensity as the way .
when i first <unk> a career , it was the filmmaking .
this seemed to be the best way to tell stories stories stories , to tell stories stories , and to create images to the need to be able to create images .
as a kid , i &apos;m constantly going to recapitulate and so .
so , movies , films , images and stories can fit together .
of course , the stories that i &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; aliens , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , i could tell my <unk> for the <unk> and the crunch .
so , the king of these two passions .
something happened happened to be successful , &quot; <unk> : &quot; to solve a kind of a open-ended <unk> -- and we had to solve a kind of a open-ended <unk> -- we dove , <unk> , back , back , back .
what was the first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that has ever seen in a movie .
the film was not a money , no money , he played his <unk> his <unk> , but i realized something fascinating that audience was like a <unk> , like a <unk> , who was initiated in the whole world .
according to the arthur face are often not respectful technologies and not more complete .
so they were something magical .
and i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that has to be necessarily in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went into &quot; terminator , &quot; my next film , even a lot further .
together with onboard modified , we created the guy out of the guy from the <unk> metal , and the success of the success of this effect .
and it worked , again , we &apos;ve been a little bit of the very diverse , and the effect of the audience was a little bit more money .
and from these two experiences , a whole new world for the creativity , a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company to be a good friend of living in the good friend of living in the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea of this company was to make inexpensive the phase , using visual <unk> with visual <unk> , and the same way to start with visual <unk> .
and so we did that , and we &apos;re also an air conditioner .
but i saw the mid- , we looked at the mid- -- what we did in the <unk> and <unk> , what we did was actually designing the company in the <unk> and <unk> .
i had this piece of &quot; avatar that takes the origin of avatar that takes the origin of the same brain , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> moves , the sum of human characters , the <unk> , who had been made on <unk> , and the world should be <unk> .
but the other hand smells quite a pretty nice , and the people in my company told me that we didn &apos;t get able to do this .
so i &apos;m going to try and made this other film about the big bang .
the <unk> i &apos;ve been banging as a barrier and julia on a ship , it was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a film , a fortune .
but really i was actually trying to get the real core of the titanic .
i &apos;ve got the film .
this is the truth . the studio that i did not have .
i &apos;ve got convinced , i &apos;ve convinced that the god , &quot; we &apos;re going to demonstrate the actual real science .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is tremendously important . it &apos;s a good <unk> . &quot;
and i persuaded you to finance an expedition .
sounds , and this is back to the rest of the rest of your imagination .
we then then six months later , a reality that i actually got in a russian <unk> <unk> , <unk> , four miles under the surface of the <unk> , and i see the real titanic through a <unk> institute .
this was not a movie , no <unk> , that was really .
so , that &apos;s really me .
and the human rights were enormous . we had cameras and make and make all sorts of things .
and i realized how much this <unk> , a <unk> .
well , yeah , they were also <unk> and <unk> .
you put up into the capsule , you can get into this dark , <unk> environment , <unk> environment , where no hope is not going to be back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is as if i was in a <unk> .
this is really cool . &quot;
i was so nervous obsessed with the study of the study .
anyway , anyway , the part of curiosity and science and science has been everything . it was a problem , it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was a .
and it was an experience that allowed me to settle .
because , you know , i could to introduce a creature where we could designing a visual effect , and i couldn &apos;t grasp what i see beyond the image of the video .
in some of the other creative poet , i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that even had seen before and for the science , sometimes , sometimes things that even had seen before and for the science , when we saw them , no words .
so this has really <unk> me and i wanted to be more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to my <unk> <unk> when my <unk> counterparts was on ice cream than a while . &quot;
and then we began to we called <unk> , &quot; and they &apos;re doing with <unk> .
we &apos;re flying to the <unk> .
we punched little robots that we built , the <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and the inner of the sudden , which was never before .
no one had ever ever seen the insides of the <unk> , you had no tools for this . so we evolved to technology .
well , i &apos;m now going to go back to the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> that &apos;s pretty much and see <unk> that i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that once once i know that
and i &apos;ll fly to fly with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i &apos;m not just going to show it , but my conscious is within the vehicle .
it felt , when i was physically inside the titanic of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a 26-year-old that i &apos;ve ever been given to the age of a corner , i had to have been given to the age of the vehicle , because i was clicking , clicking , clicking months , when we looked at the movie .
this was an accurate copy of the blueprints of the top of the ship .
so this was a highly curious .
she made me that this is what you realize that you can use such <unk> <unk> and so the way that the complexity , in this other form of existence .
it was really immensely .
and maybe a little bit of what might happen in some decades , if you &apos;ve got to explore something to explore something to explore something to explore something , in all kinds of earrings that i can introduce me as a <unk> .
after all , we began to what we looked at the other , really , really , really , for example , really , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are flexible , but here on earth .
they live with help by <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a on sunlight like we do that .
and so , you see , the directly bottle of a 500 degrees c.
at the same time i was interested in the same time i was very much for <unk> , this was back from my childhood .
and so i ended up with people who are interested in space and the performers and the performers and right drivers , they can take action to russia , and they &apos;re cross-country with the database and the <unk> , and then , flying into the international and taking our <unk> .
this was fascinating .
but then , at the end , it was pointed out that i took a deep conference .
i took them with and <unk> them access to the world , <unk> , people who are interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to work for extreme situations , so i took them , and they &apos;re allowed to take samples , and so on .
we &apos;ve been able to break it , but actually science said , frankly , specifically , he said , &quot; <unk> .
so the way i was between my existence as a <unk> , when a kid , when a kid , the implementation of reality .
and so i was march , i &apos;ve been a lot of the .
i have a lot of science , but i think you can have certainly a little a little bit a little bit a little bit like a <unk> or something like a <unk> or something .
i understood not a lot of leadership , before i was able to <unk> this .
because in a particular point i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what do you do ? &quot;
these <unk> films , we don &apos;t get us to make a money .
we &apos;re going to play a sense of fame .
all of think , i &apos;m a graphic economist and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t have to <unk> the birthplace of the beach at the beach .
i &apos;ve all these films , this conference , this crew , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money , what do you do ?
you are going to be to the job of the job , the ocean is the <unk> environment , which is there , you &apos;re going to get it because of the ocean , and because of the odd connection that occurs when a small group of people &apos;s a little group of people .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people who were only believed , the other agencies have been told , we were two to three months off three months .
and in this community , you see the most important thing about each other , because you &apos;ve got one job , because you have a job that you can explain .
if you &apos;re in land , and says , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , the whole technology , you can &apos;t explain the other , and the difficulty , the whole technology , then the whole technology , then you can &apos;t explain the other , and the difficulty who have been in common , and you know , it never can .
there &apos;s a connection , a musical child .
so when i first film to turn my next film , &quot; i tried to turn the same thing , which is that you have to ask it , which is that you have to ask it .
it was really changed the dynamic .
so i got back to a little team on <unk> terrain , we should be able to &quot; avatar with a new technology that haven &apos;t been before .
hugely enough .
a woman challenge .
and we were able to have been a period of a right in a right way .
it changed my way , films , completely changed .
there were people who were focused on , we would have this <unk> , really <unk> and on the planet .
for me , there was more a liberating kind of time to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we wrap out of all of the closing ?
what did we learn from ?
i think , in fact , in first place that curiosity is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful characteristic .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the way the way of their teams is more important than all the world &apos;s bankers .
i &apos;m going to say that young people who say , &quot; give me a advice that i can do something . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> yourself .
the other thing you have to be doing some of you . it doesn &apos;t bet itself , not to themselves , but emotionally ahead of you . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> : &quot; no means is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and achieving skills , fail has to fail , an alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> .
no problem , the innovation , the innovation was ever risk without risk .
you must be ready to take this risks .
this is the idea that i want to do you with you with you with you , fail , is a real , but it &apos;s not a . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about energy and climate .
and maybe the surprises may have a little bit , because my <unk> in the foundation surrounding vaccines and the seed maps of vaccines and the things that we can invent , and deliver a more better life .
but the energy , climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other animal on the planet .
<unk> means that the guardian of many years are not curing growing over many years , and it &apos;s not grow much or a little bit of how much can &apos;t do their own environment .
it leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate is terrible .
and then , also the most important thing for them very important .
and fact , if you just give you a thing to reduce a thing to reduce the price , to be able to escape energy energy .
well , the <unk> &apos;s about the time .
in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact ,
the <unk> <unk> the industrial revolution and even century there was a rapid case of the <unk> and so 20th century , we had a little case , we could create modern materials , so many things .
so we &apos;re so privileged to in a borderless world with electricity in the rich world .
but if we take the price of the price -- let &apos;s make the price increase -- we &apos;re going to make a new barrier and this barrier depends on co2 together .
co2 is <unk> the planet and the equation for co2 emissions is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 emissions that has some very negative implications , which is worse , which is worse , the <unk> , effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the natural ecosystems , the natural ecosystems is not able to adapt to the natural ecosystems , and thus all the entire way .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the other people <unk> <unk> and the other people , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly <unk> , like severe these days , but they &apos;ll be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the monet several : &quot; we need to put down on top of the top zero , and we really need to get down to the top of the top zero .
isn &apos;t that half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : we can come close to the brink of temperature , is going to increase the temperature .
so that &apos;s why a big challenge .
it &apos;s quite different than saying , we &apos;ve got a studio high levels of trucks , the under a three feet , and then you can get the kind of <unk> .
this has to be quite down , on the end .
now , we speed a lot of <unk> <unk> from 26 billion tons .
each american dinosaur 20 tons . people are poor countries , less than a .
in average , it &apos;s about five feet for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to change changes , which is zero .
it &apos;s really hard .
so , we just varied different economic changes in the world , and we need to go from <unk> and to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit terrified -- the <unk> -- the way they want to bring direction and and that &apos;s how to bring this thing -- co2 -- you want to get this thing -- co2 -- from the average energy , the average energy energy for everybody in each service and co2 that will be the device .
so let &apos;s look at each of the <unk> , and we think we &apos;re going to get this on the end of zero .
probably you have to get a numbers to zero .
now , this is basic algebra , but we &apos;re going to be through .
we &apos;ve got the population .
today , people are <unk> billion people , today .
and it &apos;s going to be the most fundamental billion entries to move billion .
if we &apos;re very successful , the <unk> and <unk> are we might have flown 70 percent of 15 percent , but we might see 10 percent of 15 percent , but we &apos;re going to see a slope about the time .
the second factor is the services that we use .
the whole thing heats all the food that we eat , clothing , television , .
these are very good things , and <unk> means that this has almost close to the the <unk> to do this services .
it &apos;s great that these things are going to cut .
in the rich world , in the science , we might be able to do <unk> and less use less use , but in average , this year , this year , and then thus more than doubles , the numbers of the bottom line is going to be the bottom line .
here &apos;s a very basic metaphor . there &apos;s too light to light , so you can read the homework ?
and these students have not , so they go out and read their <unk> underneath the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the <unk> , the energy , there &apos;s a good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going to be increasing .
because of all of these bodies combined in the <unk> , through other <unk> , through other <unk> , there are lots of services , there are lots of services , the united states , to get 90 percent .
in other , the classic director of <unk> , &quot; -- is <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , and : <unk> <unk> , -- &amp; lt ; &amp; lt or <unk> , is the power of improvements , is the power of improvements very much .
now , if we &apos;re optimistic , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may be optimistic or maybe even a factor of three or maybe even a factor of a factor of three or maybe even a factor of a factor .
but at first three , we are now from 26 billion , but we &apos;re now going to 13 billion tons of <unk> , and not the gps simply not .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor , and this is a factor that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be avoided .
it turns out the question , if you can get this on .
if they were coal , no .
if they &apos;re labeled <unk> : no .
almost every conceivable <unk> , today , today , the renewables and <unk> renewables , the renewables and <unk> .
so , what we need to do is to create a new system , is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
so if i use the term &quot; miracle &quot; is not use the revenue .
the microprocessor is a miracle of wonder . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the is the services is a miracle .
people have here , the computer number of many of these accidents are .
there &apos;s no idea there , there &apos;s no idea that you have a miracle to an individual date .
usually is usually just a video game and some some other things , other things .
in this case , we have to give you a <unk> and a miracle in a very short time .
well , i wondered how i can really get this ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that gives the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year , i was going to be a pilot and sort of people that .
and the idea was really , you really know , there &apos;s people who live with the mosquitoes .
for energy , i remembered this one .
i decided that the east asian <unk> of fireflies are my <unk> to the environment .
so here &apos;s some natural selection .
you &apos;ve told me that they don &apos;t bite that bite . they &apos;re not going to leave it .
well , there &apos;s all kinds of pollen like this , but they don &apos;t have a lot .
we need solutions , either one of the unimaginable a unimaginable unimaginable charge of the same , and even though there &apos;s many ways to people , in which people are in , i really , really , just like five , the most important demands .
i &apos;ve got a <unk> , fusion <unk> , fusion and <unk> .
this may be a <unk> , and if you expect a better , i would be , but my <unk> , would be neat , but my famous thing is , but my <unk> , , because they don &apos;t give them us , because they all have the most significant problems .
let &apos;s look at first , fossil research , especially in coal , or behavioral , or magnets .
what you have to do is just seem to be , but this is not , you may not just , but it &apos;s not like it &apos;s not like it , and then it makes sense and then manipulating it and hope that it stays there .
there &apos;s some <unk> that &apos;s on a 60 percent -- 80 percent of the co2 -- 80 percent of co2 , but a long-term commitment for the most basic time , is a big challenge , but the biggest problem is a big challenge here , the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who is going to make it ?
who can do something that would make something many of us bigger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from the condensation and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough thing .
next : <unk> .
and also , the costs of these are problems , especially in <unk> countries , the question for safety , the question for safety , the question for safety , that you really feel about the human rights movement .
and what do you do is then ?
because he doesn &apos;t even though he doesn &apos;t even though he &apos;s a lot of worries it .
so three very hard problems that are are vibrant , and they &apos;re going to work on .
the last three years of five comments .
it &apos;s the renewables that renewables are called called the way they called .
and the other thing also -- although it &apos;s great , you know , they don &apos;t need some drawbacks -- they &apos;ve got some drawbacks .
and the one is the equation that create these technologies are dramatically create dramatic lower than the cheerleaders .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many of a lot of a normal <unk> , a normal power plant .
and then there &apos;s a new code : the sources of seattle .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be the day , they don &apos;t seem to be just a day , and the wind isn &apos;t constantly .
so you have to be if you have to be a of these sources , you have a way that , the ability to be available in times .
so there &apos;s great <unk> . if we say , the power of the country , they don &apos;t have the power of the country , but if we say , the power of the country , they also need to deal with the risk of where &apos;s the energy of the where comes from the way that the energy of the energy of the .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the round , i &apos;ve got all sorts of batteries , which made the machine that was made of batteries , the world , <unk> , for everything , and i found all the batteries that are the world , <unk> , , for everything , the world that we produce , less , less than 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as 10 as
so we need a big breakthrough , something that can be 100 % , as the <unk> .
this is not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources , we say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the concept of the action .
if you want to talk about 100 percent to support , you need an incredible thing .
now , where should we go to the question : what &apos;s the right approach ?
a a local project ? how do we get to the ? how do we get to ?
what we need is a lot of companies that are hundreds of working on .
in each of these five century , we need to be at least 100 people .
in many cases they say , they are nuts ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of that there are many , which are the way there .
bill gross has several companies , among other , among other , the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , the great things , and interesting and interesting ways to support and i try to support .
nathan myhrvold and i finance , finance , who might arrest , maybe the buildup of nuclear weapons .
there &apos;s some innovations in the <unk> , <unk> , .
the evolution has been done in this industry has been a great surprise that , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are the good concepts .
the <unk> means that you can click instead of the bailout , which is the percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent to burning the 99 percent .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had never been sensible , but you could never really reasonable sensible , but since it would work out of their reasonable failure , but it would work out of their reasonable <unk> , you can see that , since that &apos;s this right , it looks like that .
and because you &apos;re going to have 99 percent of the <unk> , is much better .
in fact , in fact , you can program the garbage , and you can even use the buckets off as a plastic .
instead of dealing with the head of surfaces , they burn it .
this is uranium a uranium , a bit like a candle .
you see , there &apos;s a kind of new era , often as &quot; the cries of the &quot;
this solves the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a living space in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part of the part that is now called the part of the multiverse is called <unk> uranium .
the u.s. military wrote the u.s. military .
and if you drill them up and just <unk> , you just get enough fuel to the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s lots of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many of concepts we need to come forward to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony like our public ?
well , we &apos;re going to be to the end of the goal we need to get across the <unk> .
many of a 80 percent reduction of a 80 percent reduction of 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we &apos;re going to get there .
the rest of the percent are in poor countries , and they still have a more agriculture , and then , <unk> , and then , of course , maybe , to be effective .
so , to get this , you need to get the industrialized countries , including countries like china , including their <unk> completely <unk> .
the other thing tells us if we use the technology technology , whether they &apos;re in all of the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way we &apos;re on the rest of the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is a <unk> that <unk> .
if we go from there , how should the 2020 looked like ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to use the way to the way to the way to the way to the way , we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> and also the temperature .
but actually , these note , not completely to the big bang , but even something less important important , or even something less important , which is the accumulation of innovation that should be a no-brainer of innovation .
this distribution is going to do with <unk> <unk> and we can measure this : in <unk> , in <unk> , and <unk> .
there &apos;s lots of great books about this subject .
the al gore completed , &quot; we have the choice &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the corn air . &quot;
they &apos;re going to go through and create a framework where this will be a wide of the deep sea , because we need to help support of all sides .
there &apos;s some kind of the together .
this is a wish .
a very clear wish that we invent this technology .
if you just allowed me to get a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president president , a vaccine , and i could tell you this wish , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> , that wish will be put this wish .
this has the largest impact .
if we can &apos;t get these wish , the training between the human and china , between the united states and china , between the united states and china , between poor and the rich and almost all of the people are going to be very worse .
so what do we need to do ?
for what kind of <unk> was going to do ?
we need to put more carefully .
if countries in places like <unk> , they should not just talk about co2 .
you should have these <unk> and they were introduced by the most ridiculous why the most ludicrous , that the innovative meme spent wired .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; it &apos;s like something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread .
we need to have dialogue with <unk> and dangerous and also the things that are going to be undertaken .
it &apos;s a more important wish , but i think we can modify it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand more precise things -- -- -- this can make us a free scale of the world &apos;s brain ?
bill gates : the simulation of bosses , all of the great learning to the bottom , which we &apos;ve done some of the great scientist , which we &apos;ve done some of the great scientist to ensure that it turns out to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , and it &apos;s reasonable , it &apos;s only in the <unk> .
the hard step is the building of the first <unk> , more convenient to find another <unk> , the <unk> and the place of the the first ones .
once the first thing is , if it &apos;s like , if it &apos;s all right , it &apos;s all right , because the record that indicate , because the chinese is so different than how we know you .
to understand this really , this means not to build almost like a vertical column , nuclear <unk> <unk> , this <unk> <unk> , this sport , this sport , this sport , this <unk> , and it &apos;s beginning to the bottom ?
<unk> : exactly . today , you need to customize the reactor , so there &apos;s lots of people , so you need to think about the reactor , so there &apos;s lots of people , and things are , or <unk> , or <unk> . that &apos;s not good .
but if you &apos;ve got to the cheap fuel , you can think for 60 years -- think about 60 years -- think about a column -- they &apos;re doing , without the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and photographed 60 60 years and then it &apos;s ready .
a <unk> , the one of the solution is a solution for the trash .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the garbage : you can make it much less rubbish -- there &apos;s a lot less rubbish -- there &apos;s a lot of crap to the next and burning it .
and we start to waste the garbage , the garbage exists , which exists in this <unk> or <unk> , that &apos;s our <unk> .
so , what &apos;s the most reactors , what we &apos;re going to see in our brains , what we &apos;re going to fill in our brains and that will dramatically accelerate the <unk> recipe .
but as they communicate with different people , this ability to have the opportunity .
where &apos;s the most fundamental interest , so what really does ?
<unk> : now we don &apos;t have a place where we don &apos;t have a place where the name is , india , china &apos;s book , india , china &apos;s book , india , china &apos;s book , india , china , india , china , in russia , india was here and talked about how this fits to the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese have something right now .
this is a nuance of a thing that was done .
this is a more important step , but it &apos;s like a faster and some countries have these these days , so some countries have a corresponding , a <unk> , a <unk> for our first first .
in their way , and get to make something really a little bit really to call ?
<unk> : now we need to need <unk> things that are very favorable , <unk> things that are very favorable , we have 20 years to reinvent 20 years and then 20 years .
this is the that the standard that we need to be the <unk> that we need to .
and , you know , you know , if you &apos;re all right , and that &apos;s a big wish , could keep the easy .
and fortunately , there &apos;s dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of hundreds of companies , and we need hundreds of these conditions , for that , for the pilots .
and it would be best if it would be , if it could , if it could cause a mixture .
we need to need a solution .
the great potential breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing that you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
this would be also without the <unk> , but it makes so much more important .
in the meanwhile , there &apos;s other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how well as well as it , but there &apos;s the way that the way is a different approach .
there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s difficult to which something difficult seems to us , but maybe that &apos;s going to say that .
and so , but then , there &apos;s beauty , but the beauty is like a <unk> , and they are authorized the radiation , the footprint , the footprint , the footprint and the costs , so we can modify the potential , so much energy , so the impact on the land and other things , almost in a way and other things , almost in a way .
if that doesn &apos;t work what ?
do we need to try to try to try to try to keep the <unk> stable to keep the <unk> stable to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you get trapped in this situation , it &apos;s like a lot of it has to be a lot of time , and then you &apos;re going to tell you a heart valve . what do you need a <unk> or a <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , which are himself like different techniques to the warming techniques that we &apos;ve got to to transmit 20 or 30 years longer , by the <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you should not just to work at the insurance , because if you might make a reminder that you eats , because you know , a a little rescue .
i don &apos;t know if the clever thing is , if you look at the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s a closer to the problem , but there &apos;s a closer to the problem , if you get to have to be able to be able to expect this innovation , and we expect .
<unk> : have a or two sentences for the to persuade you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are very different .
those of the towers are , are very little bit .
say , there &apos;s negative impacts that &apos;s compatible with the clouds that are the things ?
there &apos;s lots of things that you can say , is that there &apos;s a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is like , as much like , in the aids .
you &apos;re going to have a mistake , and you &apos;ll have to be much later .
and so , the idea of being , now , if you &apos;ve all kinds of friction in order to invest in some ways , you know what &apos;s -- is not necessarily the the recipe and there are people in the rich world , and there &apos;s people in the rich world , and say , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , that &apos;s not a big deal .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be concerned about .
but my dream is here &apos;s the skeptics , though you can do it , and at the same time , it doesn &apos;t wasn &apos;t even a co2 , i just don &apos;t want to accept it , and at the same time , it doesn &apos;t wasn &apos;t even a co2 , i &apos;ll accept it cheaper than the way . &quot;
and the answer to the most popular <unk> <unk> that if you solve all of malaria and energy use to solve all of malaria , all of malaria , all the other goals suffer that are <unk> , all the other goals below malaria , all the other goals below the resources that we can do , as better things we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual accumulation for the research -- let &apos;s say , the u.s. should be 10 billion tons than they &apos;re doing -- that &apos;s not as dramatic .
underneath the other things that are not suffering .
you get to a big <unk> , and here , sensible people , when you have something that &apos;s not the economic room , and try to finance , and it &apos;s going to finance .
it &apos;s because , you &apos;re very shortly with a <unk> and the <unk> , and i think we should try to try to try to try to try to be very much more .
if the <unk> , you &apos;ll get a very high frequency , and then just the rich .
i mean , every one of us could not have five times a lot of our energy consumption without the lifestyles .
for the lower two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more <unk> .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why is not limit more ? &quot;
he &apos;s still talking about , because of the former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very implausible group , and so it &apos;s why he &apos;s going to do this .
and this is a toy that i think is to appropriate .
the research is just nuts , how little will be supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to say , for almost all the people here , if i say that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
rs : thank you .
a couple of years ago , here at ted , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . <unk> <unk> the <unk> structure structure , the <unk> structure structure structure , about 20 , and about a buck .
the marshmallow have to be on top .
and , even though , although it really seems to seem to do it hard , because it &apos;s very quickly .
and so i thought this is a really interesting idea , and i &apos;ve got it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve got around 70 70 pounds of the world around students , and architects , even with <unk> and architects , even with <unk> and there &apos;s something that &apos;s important to the other nature of cooperation , and i want to share with you with you .
usually , usually , most people &apos;s own people himself .
you talk about it , you think , as you &apos;re going to look like , they &apos;re <unk> .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they &apos;re doing and start .
they invest a lot of your time in the <unk> current structures , the soft structures of hierarchy of hierarchy structures .
and then finally , soon , just a time before you don &apos;t have time to have time to have time , takes the marshmallow and they put it on the top of the back back and &quot; <unk> ! &quot; she &apos;s got her job .
but what &apos;s going on , is almost always , it &apos;s happening , &quot; the &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; because the weight of the <unk> that the whole thing is in and <unk> .
there &apos;s a series of people who are much more more than others , as others , and below under the drug users .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and produce <unk> .
and of course , there &apos;s also teams to be more &quot; <unk> , and underneath the best <unk> of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
like us peter hirshberg , they didn &apos;t just have the highest towers , but the most momentous structures of all .
what might be wondering : how does this ? why ? why ? what &apos;s going to do ?
and peter hirshberg : none of the children , the children &apos;s boss at the spaghetti sauce .
they invest in <unk> .
there &apos;s another reason for another reason .
and that <unk> was brought to be pronounced by the occasion of the , ok .
and it &apos;s going to screw it .
what happens happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , they have no time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds , sound what ?
what &apos;s <unk> different is that they start with the harsh and social prototypes , and prototypes , <unk> prototypes , always with the universe at the top , so they &apos;ve got to fix the
<unk> <unk> this kind of collaboration that &apos;s the collaboration of a <unk> <unk> .
and with each trial , the kids should feedback the children feedback .
so the performance is to work with prototype , and we see how different teams teams .
the average generation for about <unk> , <unk> taxes are half of them , a half of them , a lot of the more more <unk> than the adult adults .
who is the successful &apos;s successful ?
architects and engineers , to be lucky .
i have a superrabbit that i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they get triangles and <unk> geometric sites are essential to build the key structures .
<unk> is something about average . but here &apos;s what it &apos;s interesting .
you put a <unk> administrator on the team , they &apos;re significant significant .
it &apos;s incredible . you see around and see the way that &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can change the predictions . why does this happen ?
because they &apos;re <unk> skills .
they conduct the process , you understand him .
and the thing that &apos;s going to be able to improve the performance of the tasmanian enormous force .
and the skills and <unk> and their most brothers are going to be .
if you have 10 teams that they &apos;re going to take the typical 6 , they get about 6 , the stable structures .
i was trying to do something .
i thought , we would go to the <unk> .
so i offered to software dollars the winner for the winner .
what do they do with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is not weird . it &apos;s not a stable structure .
if any <unk> has six <unk> construction composed of god , he would have the price home crying .
isn &apos;t it not interesting that the sophistication of the <unk> is a strong effect ?
we took this practice with the same students .
what do they do ?
now , she understood the benefit of the &quot; the &quot;
this was the same thing , bad team of a video game .
they have the highest construction of time .
there &apos;s also true lessons for us , and succeeding .
they may ask questions : why would someone actually could actually create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i &apos;m going to try to help digital tools and volunteer , cars , cars , video games and &quot; decommissioned <unk> . &quot;
and what the most important thing is , is to identify it to identify .
because frankly , every project has its own .
the challenge of the challenge of offers a shared experience , a common language , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of exercise exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can store <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they find enormous examples of all the world , like people can modify and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the most important lesson , i think i is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires it to the task , and we we all think of our senses , like our thoughts and our thoughts , and our job , in the challenge we we &apos;re going to do .
and sometimes a little tiny prototype of this experience , all it takes to be a <unk> &quot; -- &quot; a &quot; <unk> &quot;
and this can make a big difference .
thank you .
so we &apos;re like a machine , we should have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a time .
and everyone in this room has to be in this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; they can &apos;t go to here and now stay here .
and i ask myself , what they would choose , because i &apos;ve often been often asked by the question of the question , and they wanted to go all the rest of the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to take the time before there were cars , before or &quot; america , &quot; america &apos;s &quot; america or america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m confident confident that you have to zip to <unk> , <unk> is the actual 22nd .
and i understand .
i &apos;m not going to say that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be able to stay in the past , because i &apos;m a more rural .
it &apos;s because no possibility of this planet , but not going back to the same way , they go forward .
so i want to say this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most greatest time , which has ever been on the planet , which they were ever known : health , mobility : health , mobility , mobility , mobility , declining .
there was never before a time .
my wife died all the water than they were .
my grandparents are diagnosed with <unk> <unk> .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so there should be better one nine , the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just about people like us , because this is a greater thing than that .
a kid who can expect today in today , can expect to live in today , so long as the richest man in the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an unbelievable fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox people on this planet .
they have the demographics of the earth &apos;s a way that no war has been done .
they &apos;re gone . they are vanished .
we have superstar , and we have a lot of things .
in the rich world , the millions of organizations exist only a few of us in a generation , no resemblance .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
now , know all of anyone , what &apos;s that ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed the people , and that &apos;s the world &apos;s own way .
and from my perspective , the scientific method , if it works , if it works , if it &apos;s not , it &apos;s going to change if it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , unfortunately , the whole good news is that the whole good news news , because there &apos;s a few other other problems , and they often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often , often ,
and one of them is that despite all our achievement , a billion people on the world every day .
and this number goes up , and they &apos;re very quickly , and this is the game-changer .
and not just that we have our imagination to be equipped to cope .
the water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , oil , oil , oil , oil , oil , oil , and if we don &apos;t have to go from that pragmatic <unk> , we &apos;re also able to do it .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , the people are feeding the billion people , without the land that they live in .
i think we can this world , which they &apos;re not supposed to be destroyed .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is what i &apos;m just like me -- one of the things that worries me , we never keep scientific progress . we never never have to yet again , again , never , even though .
and we were never able to get able to <unk> , as we can today .
we &apos;re at the cusp of suffering , lots of events in many , and yet i really really spent hundreds of years ago , we need to report about these things , we need to report about these things , where we &apos;ve been talking about these things , more than now .
people explained in their faith , and they &apos;re tightly tightly tightly tightly that you can &apos;t .
not even the truth .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion ; i think a right to progress .
but you know , what you have no right ?
they have no idea of their own facts , &quot; hey , they don &apos;t have a .
and i have a while to find out that .
i was about a decade ago , i &apos;ve got a article about the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed by resistance to a resistance , and on the resistance , the most effective in the history of health is in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i did just take a paper and go and drove .
and soon i wrote a article about how chinese food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i &apos;ve also talked about a article written , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that people thought they were saying , &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecule was a random kind of priesthood to nature .
but you know , i &apos;m going to do , i wrote the article , i was going to go .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we eat food , that &apos;s okay .
but this article , i &apos;m worried about , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and then i found it out .
and this is because this is not that this is not quite independent .
these were <unk> people , people people , people people , people are .
they were just like the people in this room .
and this was me like this .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s say , &quot; let &apos;s say honest .
we &apos;re at the point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
we talk about this , with little bits : &quot; progress .
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s going on .
we have the implications of institutions in institutions , in trilobites , and sometimes , in science , and sometimes there &apos;s no reason why that should be be that it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just give a few name code , and people will understand .
jim , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , weapons , weapons , the <unk> .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who we believed that they were always right , so they were always .
ask you , you urge the evidence , you require .
just take anything else .
but now you get this right now : if you get evidence to these evidence , and we &apos;re not good .
and i can say that from the reason , that we &apos;ve just seen in a epidemic of life , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully never see again .
and about 12 years ago , a terrible story published a terrible story that the <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
very scary .
so academy studies had to determine whether this is .
well , given studies should be avoided ; it &apos;s a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came in 2008 , from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter difference because we think we &apos;re seeing what we see what we see seeing what we see seeing what we feel really comfortable .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of <unk> , the data , the data , we have data , and i understand that , i think that we all all .
but you know what ?
this was the result of this .
so , there &apos;s one of the one of the only countries in one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s happened that we could do .
well , i understand . i gotcha .
because somebody &apos;s a blank blank ?
has a single person in the audience of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest ?
it &apos;s not very often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country , not yet , but in the world , in the last year .
these are lots of deaths through the united , 20 immunization .
but because this is not here &apos;s what this is not here , can we get it , and people like , and we can fly it , and we are extraordinary <unk> .
and that can make them because they cause and create a correlation .
you don &apos;t understand that this stuff is , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn to learn , and it &apos;s very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he &apos;s <unk> by one of the worst <unk> of humankind .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , , <unk> , <unk> .
the guy in the middle of the favela .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he has just just just a few different people in a <unk> .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
now , this is good , except to be a paul , and talk about vaccines and talk about vaccines and how many trains they are just going to stop .
and this is what he says .
paul is an amoeba .
if paul in public <unk> , &quot; can &apos;t be without <unk> .
he gets answering calls to the home because people would love to tell you where his children school .
and why ? because paul had a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are .
you take them up , let &apos;s add the disease , and that &apos;s happening .
we have now to escape the country .
and this is going to be a little bit , and pretty soon as soon as soon as this is just a question of numbers .
and they won &apos;t just to be .
what &apos;s called <unk> ? suppose we don &apos;t suppose that . why not ?
i had a visit of mine introduced me a few weeks ago , and she &apos;s just a little bit .
no one has ever before .
they would not have their child mortality . no fall .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t know the <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> <unk> .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe the plane is now in lagos into an airplane and flies , in the moment , the moment he &apos;s got to talk about the moment .
and in a few hours , he and <unk> a car , and he &apos;s coming to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit the most uplifting <unk> of the day .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because , how does the world is now .
this is the planet that we live in , not as if it &apos;s not the threat .
we love to get us in dolphins . we love that .
have today , all your tree ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that gives you the jumps .
i know that they &apos;ve done this because the americans is the americans of the sacred .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative and you take alternative and find out how often do we find find out they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly constantly shuffling .
they also have their urine . they never .
this is okay , they want to be able to pay for a dark of dark .
i agree with you .
political <unk> .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i know , i know , we hate the drug .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t trust trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not we should not . our healthcare system .
it &apos;s been to millions of people .
it &apos;s totally amazing to lock and <unk> themselves , can afford it .
so we run before , and where we run it ?
we run into the arms of the <unk> .
this is great . i love the fiddle .
but you know , this is really a serious thing because the stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for this .
and i &apos;ve all kinds of little <unk> here .
not , -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , , da , white , i don &apos;t even know what that &apos;s , but we &apos;re going to spend billions of dollars for this , but we &apos;re going to spend billions of dollars for this , but we &apos;re going to spend billions of dollars for this , but we &apos;re going to spend billions of dollars for this , but we &apos;re going to spend billions of dollars for this , but we &apos;re going to spend
and you know what ? if i say , if i say , if i say , &quot; what does it mean ? people , let me do ? people what they want .
you feel fine . &quot;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because it &apos;s not true about the <unk> , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to assume my word , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to suppose my <unk> , which means that can seal <unk> your patients .
if you &apos;re looking at this path , where you and magic and magic replace the magic replace replacing and science , and science replaced , you don &apos;t want to be .
they get into <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he was 400,000 in 400,000 times , because he was made that red wine , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> drugs , we know that they can freely .
hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country , the worse than any other of that disease .
tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always always always .
now , the <unk> epidemic epidemic , where we &apos;re just in the marketplace , is this marketplace , is this marketplace <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they need to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is the ideology , not science .
all of the things that we eat , every communicator , every branch , every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , every transcontinental , by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we made this all done .
we have this last eleven , we did it .
and they are working on and and they didn &apos;t work .
we are returning , what did not work .
now we can do it . and of course , there &apos;s risks in rice , and of course , there &apos;s risks in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people living their lives .
that doesn &apos;t want to do ?
i must say , i don &apos;t understand .
we blend crops .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly saying is : too many chemicals , , , , , , we don &apos;t want to do , we don &apos;t want to create enormous amounts of the thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to live in companies .
we don &apos;t want to be the companies .
and you know what my answer is to be a big deal ?
yes , they have right . let &apos;s fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge technological , but that &apos;s not science .
this has to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
they know , the science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a land .
it &apos;s not just a idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we don &apos;t want to use science , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , because we are afraid of people in the science , and it &apos;s going millions of people from the outside .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will get 70 percent more food than just at the moment , 70 percent . 70 percent . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in africa , in the last 30 years .
embarrassing : the embarrassing .
they need the , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? how long changed .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this eating food , like , &quot;
so , in the case , half billion people eat food .
it &apos;s about how a way you can .
it &apos;s just a sack calories , it &apos;s a <unk> .
it has no nutrients , it has no claws , and scientists are all right in it .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be kidnapped .
they wouldn &apos;t be called starvation , and you know what ?
this would be beautiful . it would be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all of the things i can say , why do we fight this ?
i mean , we ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to do it ?
it &apos;s not about genes , gene , it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our industrial passion for hormones , our savings accounts for a myriad food , better food , wiser food .
it &apos;s not about <unk> , it &apos;s about to get people alive , and it &apos;s going to understand it &apos;s highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t pretend to do if we do something guilty , we do something guilty of the we , we don &apos;t have to be guilty , high-tech .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s a selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we &apos;ve got to stop this .
after this , funny funny want to say , &quot; you should still say , &quot; you should still be the ridiculous and the future ? &quot;
anyway , i &apos;m definitely going to be on .
so in the moment , they &apos;re present in the present , but we have an unbelievable opportunity .
we can click this limestone on everything we want .
we can where we want to go back , where we want to go back , and we &apos;ll move them to where they want to move where we want to move forward , where we want .
we need to lead this deeply , and we need to think , but when we &apos;re going to get the back into the future , we will be relieved .
i know that we can , it can , and skiing it &apos;s me , what is the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
and i &apos;m very excited about some of the <unk> . it &apos;s like me , unless you &apos;re looking at it as a magician , except it , it &apos;s like me , as a deception that is that is just to find enough enough . &quot;
in other words , <unk> , the person in some studies , a measurable effect , because the person feels the person , or a kind of a kind of a <unk> or a kind of a kind of a measurable , like the person thinks , because the patient is called the measurable effect in the body that you call the <unk> .
deception is a little bit , because somebody &apos;s got it .
so we want to understand each other , and i want to understand you to show you a quick , very simple .
and i &apos;ll show you how it works . this is a trick that at least since the 1950s , the 1950s at all of the children in the children .
i was myself to make him from the <unk> <unk> of the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to take him for you to take him .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;m going to explain him .
so , you see what happens .
the knife that you can see , you can see that my hand , you can investigate .
i &apos;m going to just give you the knife just in my head .
i came back to my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , or from it , i will just just get my wrist right here .
so , you can see that you can see that , at any time , i can &apos;t get a <unk> anything , can &apos;t be a sleeve or a <unk> .
and the goal is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand open , and hopefully , if you go everything , it &apos;s going to formulate the knife physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical
it &apos;s actually just stuck in his place that i can shake it , without that knives .
nothing in my sleeve , or you get infected , no <unk> , and you can investigate everything .
whoa !
now , this is a trick that i often <unk> , which is interested in deception , because you can really think about deception , because you can learn very much more about deception , even though it &apos;s a very simple problem .
probably a lot of you here here in the room .
he &apos;s working .
i think the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying i <unk> my wrist <unk> to make sure that nothing in my sleeve or radiation in my sleeve , and that &apos;s a lie .
why i <unk> my wrist , <unk> <unk> , is that it &apos;s the actual secret of the illusion that &apos;s really true secret to the illusion that &apos;s really true secret to the illusion that &apos;s really true secret to the illusion that &apos;s really true secret to the illusion that &apos;s really true secret to the illusion that &apos;s really true secret to the illusion that &apos;s really true secret to the illusion that &apos;s really true secret to the illusion that &apos;s really true secret to the illusion that &apos;s really true secret to the illusion
in the moment , where i see my hand from you so that i &apos;m going to see my hand of the turn , you &apos;re going to see my favorite <unk> , just one group where he was so abundant .
great trick ?
there &apos;s no one who &apos;s not a cause .
so , it &apos;s worth spinning . right .
and when i &apos;m <unk> , it changes the fingers .
and now you might talk about why that &apos;s deception is , why is you not suggesting that there are only three fingers : because the intellect and the way that information is , because the intellect and the way that information you can &apos;t count , but two , they sequester as a group .
but now , now , now that &apos;s not a not , and then i hope i &apos;m going to see my hand .
of course , there &apos;s been able to get there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by my favorite book , the right there is there .
and if i just hand my hand , i just happened to <unk> , by the same way i &apos;m going to offer that this is the fingers back to the fingers .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can tell your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what did this with the <unk> ?
one year or so , i was a study that was really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so i was so interested in a astonishing thing .
it &apos;s what they have learned : if you &apos;re a placebo in a white pill , and in the form of a white , white , white , white , the an specific consequence of effect .
but if you ask the shape that they &apos;re going to change the pathology in a smaller scale , and this blue skin and a <unk> that &apos;s actually effective .
and that , even though , even though , even though , it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white film is not as good as a blue dot .
what ? that really is freak me .
it turned out that this is not all the time .
if you &apos;re capsules that if you &apos;re the more more than than the <unk> .
a colored wayne , which bordered is bordered in a end , and the other thing is , is better than a blank capsule .
even the advantages of the advantages .
one is a pill twice a day , not just good as three weeks -- i can &apos;t remember the brutal statistics , i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
and it &apos;s also the <unk> role in the role .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to reset the ultimate standards , you need to needle needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> substance , a few <unk> substance that you can get a patient .
so , this creates a very strong picture in the head , and that &apos;s very much more powerful than a white .
this graph is really -- i &apos;ll show you another one else &apos;s when we have a car .
so , the white thing is not as good as the blue , which is not as good as a capsule that doesn &apos;t like the needle .
and nothing of it really <unk> feature . it &apos;s just our our belief that we &apos;re doing in the same action .
i wanted to know whether i could use this idea for a trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously is clearly a deception , and let &apos;s go really look really real .
we know , from the first study that you have to needle to needle when it &apos;s to the end .
this is a 18 inch long <unk> , she &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;ll be a little bit of a little bit .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> , <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not an amazing part of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to put this needle into my skin and then through them , until you &apos;re going to run on the other side .
if you &apos;re selling -- if you &apos;re slightly slightly , slightly in the hotel , a few friends last night in the hotel , and some people i don &apos;t know , and it &apos;s a woman almost a woman .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to be able to get quickly , look for the next 30 seconds seconds , or , you know , you know , i will be the first part of the end .
you can see it right , but also , you can also <unk> if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like this , right now , where my taste is i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
does i &apos;m not going to do .
and now just a little bit of a little bit of my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had to <unk> .
about .
but now , can &apos;t be counting , isn &apos;t it ?
so , i &apos;ll show you a three , two , three , three , four , four , five , five , five , five , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think if you see the vision .
they say , &quot; okay , who doesn &apos;t mean that either , and <unk> the skin , just to be a few minutes of a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
like this is from the way ?
yeah , i know .
and the people say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t have that . &quot;
people are coming in the <unk> in the world &apos;s hindquarters .
let me show you from the outside .
this is really my skin . this isn &apos;t an amazing .
this is my meat , and i can go to the <unk> .
sorry . if you &apos;re going to get them away , don &apos;t look like you .
the people behind the or the who gets next to video , &quot; well , this is a hole and there , there would look right here , here &apos;s a hole and there would look right here , here &apos;s a hole and there really really would be really , it would bleed it . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood vessel .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
i usually would i would pull the needle .
i would mean to show you my arm , and you show that there &apos;s no brushes .
but i think , in this frame , here and the intention , from a deception to make something real real real real real real real real real real , and the same thing .
we &apos;re going to take us in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re excited about it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s going to talk about happiness .
i have some people the other people , which means that &quot; teenage boys in the last five years , they &apos;ve been published to about 40 years , and they just got much more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in the researchers .
there &apos;s lots of <unk> .
everybody would like to do it .
but despite all of these systems of work , there are several cognitive drop that it &apos;s almost impossible to do just to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly from this cognitive drop .
this applies for <unk> that &apos;s really lucky to think about her own fortune , and it &apos;s been to think for scientists , because we &apos;ve felt that we &apos;re just as vivid as any other .
the first one of this is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word is just not useful word is more useful things , because we &apos;ve got to apply it on a different approach .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could summarize it , but in the big , and we need to be able to be able to be able to do the complicated is going to take the complicated , which is the well-being .
the second is a public memory and the virtual : basically you mind , basically , basically , you &apos;re going to live in his life or happy life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both implausible and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the that we can &apos;t think about a fact that we can &apos;t think about a really , the well-being of the world .
i mean , this is a real research .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i would like to start with a situation , which was a story of my lectures , who said , &quot; he would have a symphony of my lectures , a story of a veteran , and it was an amazing music , and then it was really an amazing music .
and then he added standing , really emotionally , really emotionally emotionally , that has all the experience of the .
but it didn &apos;t have it .
what had been called the memory of experience .
he had experience the experience .
he had 20 minutes of champagne music .
she doesn &apos;t because he was a recollection of a recollection of a memory ; that was <unk> , and the memory was all he had .
what really says that we say about ourselves and think about other people think about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self , the present , the present , is able to experience the actual past , and the present , but just in just the past .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , the doctor &apos;s doctor -- they know , when the doctor asked the doctor : &quot; does it hurts when i &apos;m here ? &quot;
then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is the story of our life , and the story of our life , and the story of our life , the the question is , &quot; how did you get in the last day ? &quot;
or &quot; like , &quot; how did your journey to albania ? or something like .
these are two very different kinds of processes , the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself , and the two is part of the <unk> of the co2 emissions .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and this starts really with a basic response to our memories -- it starts to be immediately .
we don &apos;t tell stories if we &apos;re going to tell stories stories .
our memory tells us stories that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about is , what we &apos;re talking about is that we &apos;re going to keep from our evolutionary things in the our process is that we &apos;re at least is a story .
and let &apos;s go to a sample .
there &apos;s a old study .
these are actual patients that are supposed to be on .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details , it &apos;s not more painful , but she was painful , as this study was in the 1990s .
they asked asked to report all the 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are your records .
and they &apos;re asked , who &apos;s been more likely to go ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b clearly clearly . his <unk> was killed , and every minute of pain that had been longer , and every minute an patient had an patient b .
but now , there &apos;s another question : &quot; how do this patients that they &apos;re ? &quot;
and here &apos;s one surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a a lot of a a lot of a <unk> <unk> <unk> than patient &apos;s patient b.
the stories of the <unk> were wildly and because a very important part of the history is , as you can do .
and no one of the stories of the great stories of the great makeup or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is worth worse than the other .
and the ones that hurt worse is the , where the pain was at his peak , on his peak , it &apos;s a history .
how do we know that ?
because we &apos;re these guys after their psa , and also much later , &quot; how awful of the whole thing was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse than a symptom for a b in the <unk> .
now , this is a very important conflict between the <unk> and the <unk> .
from the <unk> itself , the <unk> itself &apos;s a very serious time .
now , what you could do with patient , and we &apos;ve actually got clinical trials , and it &apos;s also a clinical trials , and it &apos;s also working , you could just put the <unk> of a a <unk> to get out to him .
this is what &apos;s going to lead to lead to lead that the patient , but only a bit less than a .
and if you make a couple of minutes , you &apos;ve got a couple of minutes , you &apos;re able to do it by a helicopter and you &apos;ve got to have a much better , because now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , you &apos;ve got a better story about his experience .
so , that &apos;s a story about it ?
and this applies to the stories that binds the memory of us and it &apos;s also the stories we invent .
so , a story of <unk> are an history of the major and end .
okay , very important and in this case , the fall is the end .
now , the <unk> itself is living even alive .
it has a <unk> of the <unk> , a after the rest of the rest .
and you wonder : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is just easy . they &apos;re forever .
i mean , most of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this -- you know , the more the psychological current , which means -- you know , the more the psychological current , which means that there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 . they don &apos;t have a trail .
most of them are completely ignored from the <unk> .
and yet , but but but they also get kind of like the impression that what that is the financial impacts of the taxpayer system .
it &apos;s the most important resource that we use in this world .
and how we use seems important to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that the <unk> itself is the way that we &apos;re doing is for us .
so we have the <unk> and the <unk> themselves , and they &apos;re really comfortable .
the biggest difference between them is the way of time .
so from the <unk> , when you have a holiday , and the second week is so good , as good as the first first , then multi-touch vacation vacation , then the most potent vacation .
so it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> .
for the <unk> itself is a multi-touch component of intangible superior better better than the terrorist , because there &apos;s no new <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new ones in the treatment , because there &apos;s no new ones in the treatment , because there &apos;s no new ones that there are no new ones in the treatment .
they don &apos;t have the story .
and that &apos;s actually the critical variable that actually the critical variable , which is a <unk> self in a <unk> , has a very little impact on this story .
now , the more <unk> itself makes more than remember and stories .
it &apos;s actually a lot of the decisions , the decisions hits because if you have a patient , the , we had two <unk> surgeons , and decides to decides it , then we had two <unk> , which is memory , then the less bad is less bad , the <unk> .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t vote between the way we are not going to vote between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we think we don &apos;t think about our future normally .
we think about our future aspirational .
and basically , you can think about the words of the copyright protection , and you can think about the future self , and they can think about the future themselves as one that &apos;s <unk> by experience that &apos;s not supposed to be .
i have the idea that if we &apos;re going to have a holiday care , which means that means we &apos;re going to do is called a <unk> in the service of the <unk> itself .
and this is a bit hard to justify me .
i mean , how much did we do about our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s going to be given for the dominance of the <unk> .
and when i think about it , i think about a few years ago , we had to have a couple of years ago , the clearly the best poet , the best i ever was , the best poet , the best i tend to think about other people , as i tend to know about other .
and i &apos;ve probably probably heard about my memories of these <unk> journey , i would say say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever undertook the folder of the last images that i &apos;ve ever spent a more 10,000 .
now , these are three weeks ago , and that &apos;s just a half hours .
there seems to be a lot of you seem to give you a lot of them .
well , i like a little bit , you know , in how little , you know , in how little , if you &apos;re going to ask more about it , but even if you give them more real question , why do we give memories so much weight in the weight that we &apos;re going to do ?
so i want to think about a story .
imagine your next vacation , you know , the end of the <unk> of the <unk> could all their images and they get all their pictures , so they may remember anything .
now , would you choose the same look at the same ?
and if you choose another word , there &apos;s a conflict between your two different kinds of self and you must think about how they decide , because if you decide , in the sense of the self and you need to say how they decide , because if you think you could think of the senses , if you think they can think of the senses , you could think of the senses .
why we have the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be a problem that we can devise about a choice between the two different types of self .
now , the two types of self is two potential happiness .
there &apos;s actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to apply to the bottom , a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> themselves ?
and then you would ask questions : how happy are the live in the life of the <unk> themselves ?
and they all -- happiness is a very complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , we &apos;re going to look at a pretty good idea of the <unk> , even over the time .
if you ask after the happiness of the torah , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how do you do , or heard the person that is that if you think this person about their lives .
very different term .
each one who is not going to continue to screw the terms of happiness , and i &apos;m going to start to a lot of researchers , about the creation of happiness , the study of happiness is exactly the study of happiness .
the distinction between the basin and the satisfaction is satisfaction in the last few years , and the satisfaction is in the last few years , and now to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup has a global economic movement that more than a half of a million people , who had been asked about their lives and their experiences and their experiences and their experiences , and there was other people in the direction .
so , in the last several years , we started learning about happiness to learn from itself .
and the main lesson that we are , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how annoying life is , and they don &apos;t really talk about a lot of how happy about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you one impression of the relationship of the relationship that &apos;s the correlation about <unk> .
what that means that means that if you would listen to somebody you would you and say , oh , his father &apos;s a <unk> , like a lot of you would ask about his size ?
now , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s lots of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has been a scale of 10 orders of 10 to 10 orders of 10 orders of 10 long time , how happy he &apos;s doing .
so the correlation is .
we know what the happiness of the <unk> .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly to be a content with people who we might like to spend time , time , we like to spend time .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s what it &apos;s .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to be happy , they &apos;re going to do very different things .
the implication of what i &apos;m here is saying that we really don &apos;t really want to imagine as a substitute for a .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , , , , , , , , pretty soon , another reason we can &apos;t realize that we can &apos;t think about the same things we will pay attention to the same things we think about life and even if we actually live in .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the conclusion .
if you ask them , if you think that people would be happy to be happy to be happy if they say , we say , in the west .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , they think about the difference between california and other places , we say , we say , in the climate crisis .
now , it turns out that salt is not very important for the sake of the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even important for the sake of the <unk> themselves , the decides to themselves , the decides what they are .
now , because the <unk> itself is difficult , can move them up , and some people might draw the end of california .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting interesting to the people , which is what happens to become more happier .
now , your <unk> is not going to be happier .
we know this .
but one thing is going to happen , because if you think about how awful the weather looked at them , as terrible as terrible as usual , and you &apos;re feeling that they &apos;re expecting the right decision they have the right answer .
it &apos;s very difficult to think clear about a few days , and i hope i &apos;ve just got to give you a glimpse of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question .
thank you .
well , when we went to a couple weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty embarrassing that made out of this place .
is that something that we can do , because they now have a few minutes left ?
daniel libeskind : sure secure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup , we found in the gallup , we don &apos;t expect to find a perfectly .
we found this in the process of the <unk> itself .
if we looked at how about how organisms change the income .
and it turns out that under 60,000 dollars in the year , and this is a very big idea of americans in the year , and this is a very big idea of americans in the year , under $ $ five dollars a year , under five dollars a year 2020 .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars of the dollars in the year are people unhappy , and they &apos;ll be increasingly crops that they &apos;re going to be .
we get a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen it as flat as flat as flat as flat .
what happens is obvious , is obvious that money doesn &apos;t want to make any artifice , but that lack of money , money for money , and we can measure this misery .
in the spirit of the others , the <unk> itself , you get another story .
the greek of the car is .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the patient &apos;s entire american , it &apos;s going to freedom to come to the pursuit of the .
if people would take these <unk> , i would mean , it seems to be everything that &apos;s going on the head , everything we &apos;re going to do , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance ,
is there a chance that politicians that the country is going to take the land that includes a <unk> like the seriously and how would they do ?
<unk> : you know , i think that &apos;s recognition for the role of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world &apos;s hierarchy in politics .
the recognition is slow to be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , and they &apos;re just in other countries .
people are , they &apos;re going to think about happiness if you think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and the people will argue whether they want to explore , whether they want to study or whether you want to have this arguments quite soon .
how you can do lucky , can you think about how you think you think , and they &apos;re to think about the idea of themselves or whether they might think about the future self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to measure the <unk> of the population .
that &apos;s what i think , in the next one , or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or the nih .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or should be the most most companies political to the next few years .
thank you for the creation of the economy .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m going to show you .
i &apos;ve been thinking about 10 years , and my goal for the next decade , it &apos;s just as easy to make the world in the reality , as they &apos;re in a <unk> manner .
i have a plan . i want to argue more people , including more time playing games and <unk> games .
and currently , we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time , when you have to have a <unk> like many of the problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , in fact , my research on the institute of the institute of the institute , the opposite .
three billion dollars a week isn &apos;t enough enough to solving the most dangerous problems of the world .
in fact , in fact , in fact , i &apos;m convinced that when we survive , when we survive , we want to survive , we need to support this time .
i &apos;ve calculated that the technological of the 21 billion hours of 21 billion hours per week .
so , the fact , maybe something <unk> , so i &apos;m going to try to solve poverty and obesity , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global warming , online 21 , games continue to play , games per week to play the end of the next decade .
no , i mean , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this image , i think why i think games is pretty hard , why i think that &apos;s games like the survival of human species in the future .
this is a tudor of the photographers .
he wanted to play the emotions , and he got it on the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of the roman whales .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may have some of the kind of nuances in this painting .
you see , this sense of urgency , something scares , is something , but also , in the most part of the , right , in the end of a really difficult thing to do .
if you play , you see some of the ones here , the top of the schematic eyes , the mouth eyes and the mouth are the eyebrows point of optimism .
this is a player who &apos;s the most dramatic <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know , you know . ok . so we have a few gamers here .
a <unk> victory is a result , which is so terrifying that is that that is not knowing that it was possible .
it was called beyond the imagination .
and if you &apos;re reaching , they &apos;re shocked to be able to do something , and this is a <unk> victory .
this player is a <unk> victory .
and this is what we &apos;re looking at millions of albatross around the world , when we see the space of the next century in a traditional century , when we put the the bar of the next century in a <unk> , the face of a <unk> <unk> .
well , we &apos;re going to see more of this on the real life , when we &apos;re difficult topics .
i &apos;m going to take it as the kid in life , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok ? ok ?
i &apos;m like i &apos;m going to do this in life .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was going to talk about my dissertation , where i was in better life .
this is a problem that &apos;s a lot of gamers .
we think that we &apos;re not as good as in the reality .
and i don &apos;t mean just successfully less successful , although that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;re going to be in <unk> , i &apos;m going to make all sorts of motivations to do something worthy of the motivation , inspired .
if we &apos;re in a wi-fi zone , i think i think , is , in our best version , they turn , and they &apos;re confused in our best version , and they &apos;re confused to solve the problem , it &apos;s going to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to
and in reality , if we fail , if we look at obstacles , we &apos;re often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel threatened , maybe we &apos;re threatened by we &apos;re threatened , maybe frustrated , frustrated or <unk> .
this is what we never play , if we don &apos;t play games in games , there &apos;s just not .
and this is what i wanted to investigate as a phd student .
why is it in play , you couldn &apos;t just get anything else ?
how can we add this resource from playing ?
so i looked at games like world warcraft , the ocean is the ocean , the ideals of communal <unk> .
and i &apos;ve seen some things that should be in <unk> .
so , first , if you &apos;re trapped in one of the <unk> characters , there &apos;s lots of different characters that are willing to be the ready to be mission , and it &apos;s not immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission to mission mission to your level of perfect , right ?
so they &apos;re going to do this .
they never can &apos;t solve a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always , on the edge of their capabilities , so you have to get , and not the <unk> in the world .
you don &apos;t sit around and see , and it &apos;s always quite a little bit more complicated .
and there &apos;s also a whole collaborators .
and , in fact , where they also go to people , connecting hundreds of people who work with them , to disagree with them .
we don &apos;t live in the true life , that feeling that at least a <unk> company in a pandemic system .
and then there &apos;s this epic story , this inspirational , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are there , why we are
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re talking about &quot; level &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + &quot; + &quot; or &quot; + a &quot; + a &quot; + magazine . &quot;
this constant missing feedback that not in the life .
if i &apos;m going to leave this stage , i couldn &apos;t talk about the powerpoint , and the + + a mad idea , the <unk> idea .
i get out of the true life .
so , the problem of the <unk> , like the world &apos;s is so , so , is so , so , is so , so , is so , is so , is so , is so , is that we would rather enjoy our whole time in those 7,500 <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
by far now , all the world of the <unk> million years , spent the virtual issues of solving the virtual world .
this is not necessarily .
it may be .
but to see it in the context , at least , <unk> million years ago , our first few years ago .
so the first thing blinks is occupied .
okay , so , if we talk about how much we spend a lot of time talking about play with play with play with play with play with play with play , and when you &apos;re at the time of human development , what is going to be .
but also , for example , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time to use play , actually , what we &apos;re as humans in the human genome .
we also develop too heavy , wiser , wiser .
this is the truth . i think i think .
look at these interesting statistics , the <unk> of carnegie mellon mellon mellon guys was published in a country with classical <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> to the 21st .
so , 10,000 hours is an interesting interesting number , from two reasons .
first of all , for kids in school , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> that she was asked to spend in schools , from the five class of the high school , if you had never been missing .
so we have a <unk> <unk> , on the young people , as it means to learn what it means everything else , what it means everything they &apos;re learning .
and maybe some of you may have the new book of medicine called the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> .
so you know his theory of the success , the theory of the ages .
it &apos;s based on the great research , the <unk> that if we communicate 10,000 hours with the <unk> of a vaccine to the <unk> , for a to the 21st century , we &apos;re going to spend the <unk> in it .
we &apos;re going to be able to do as good people in the world .
so , what we &apos;ve got here is a mere generation of young people who are <unk> .
the big question is , &quot; what are the player should be good ? &quot;
because if we could figure out , we could never have previously never test .
so many people have developed in the world , the least an hour a hour a hour a hour a hour .
this is our transportation system . 500 million people , the extraordinarily of the extraordinarily , and extraordinarily , in fact , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily , extraordinarily
and in the next decade , we have a another billion player that were extraordinarily and extraordinarily , and they &apos;re always .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
the <unk> <unk> is designed to <unk> , the energy savings , and on <unk> , instead of emergent in india , particularly in india , particularly , particularly online .
you expect a flat billion players in the next decade .
so we have a total billion player .
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s to do us .
here &apos;s the four things i found was found . as first first .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something , to be a <unk> , with the belief that we have an opportunity to success .
gamers , it &apos;s a <unk> victory of possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and try it to try and the same .
player is not the first .
gamers are masters of social networks .
there &apos;s a lot more exciting research that show people more like that we like people , after we like when they have a lot .
the reason that is that there is a lot of trust to play with someone play with someone play with someone .
we trust that somebody &apos;s sake for us to <unk> , that the rules are going to be avoided , that we have to stay and to the <unk> .
so , allows the <unk> that grow of ties , trust and each .
as a result , we build a stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity productivity . fantastic
you know , there &apos;s an reason why the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> 22 hours a week is , as a <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier working on trying to work , hard to work hard , when we relax , when we relax , and when we relax , or nothing .
we know that we are more like human beings , if we were able to do that , and we &apos;re going to do that , is significant .
and player are always willing to work hard , hard to work if you get the right task .
and then finally , there &apos;s a meaning .
player love to be part of the awe <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> to the right light , to start the right light , you know , surely , the grandest is the largest side of the world .
the second largest feature of the world , almost 80,000 80,000 of warcraft is the world &apos;s worst experience of warcraft .
five million people , they use every month .
they &apos;ve been more information about world &apos;s world &apos;s web than any other topic in every other side of the world .
they create a very lucky story .
you create a graphic source of knowledge about the world &apos;s world .
ok , so these are four superpowers that are a single outcome . these are <unk> , hopeful , hopeful .
it &apos;s people who believe they could change as individuals change .
and the only problem is that you think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real change .
this is the problem i &apos;m going to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he &apos;s why people spend so much time , energy and money laundering in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be healthy , as a <unk> in korean worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is a economist . so he &apos;s locking .
and he says ...
i don &apos;t like i play games , i &apos;m a little bit disoriented .
so he says , that &apos;s actually make sense , because , in <unk> , more than living in the real life .
they can do stronger social icon than play , as a real life , they get more and more than in the real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s not that gamers is that gamers is that the gamers in the real terms .
i &apos;ll never tell me that that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s not a <unk> .
we need to start the actual world into a game .
my inspiration is coming from a event , the 2,500 years .
there &apos;s these ancient cubes , from <unk> , you know ?
this fantastic <unk> gave birth to <unk> .
and this was the first of people &apos;s first license .
and if you &apos;re using the idea of the old greek <unk> , , you know , you may have this story , &quot; maybe you may have this story . the story about how to be done .
according to the <unk> , games were games , in the kingdom of a famine .
there was a such thing , there was a high famine that king was to create a crazy idea .
people are human beings . people .
it was a really extraordinary situation . you had a sort of solution .
so they invented loud , the <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> national strategy , you would eat food , you would eat food . you would play .
and they would be like this very , in the <unk> , there &apos;s a fascinating , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> productivity that they would forgotten that it was nothing .
and then , on the next day , you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to the northwest occasion , they survived this famine by looking for 18 years , and they were playing on a day and the next day .
likewise , i think we &apos;re going to play the games .
we put games to escape the condition of suffering .
we put games to say , to sign all the way that in the real world , all the way in real life isn &apos;t necessarily , is not in the real life , and we &apos;ll make we we do what we need to play .
but it &apos;s not to be the end .
this is the exciting .
according after 18 years , the famine was not better than the famine , so the king was the king , a last nugget of <unk> .
they shared the pentagon in two .
they played a <unk> , and the <unk> was to break a <unk> adventure .
she took the <unk> and went to the search after a new home , and they &apos;re experiencing so many people , as it was like food and so forth with the rest of a neighborhood that they could be thriving .
that sounds , or something ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> that later the roman empire , the roman empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so , in fact , scientists were also aware of the notion of the mad story .
and the <unk> found a global leap that &apos;s almost 20 years , which almost 20 years , the <unk> implications .
so , there could be crazy history .
you may have saved your people through playing games in games in games , and then they were so concerned by investing in games , and then they had a much more talk about each other , they learn the entire civilization .
so we can also .
we &apos;re playing with the launch .
this was the first <unk> in the world of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world
they played 18 years , <unk> <unk> , we had to play with 16 years old .
i &apos;m going to argue , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> .
so , they sent half your civilization in the search world , so i so i suppose my 21 billion <unk> <unk> a week .
we should be <unk> that half of us an hour a day , play the problems of play with play , we have the problems of the physical world .
i know you &apos;ll ask questions , &quot; how do we solve the real-world world ? &quot; and so i just exactly this question , i &apos;ve been launched my work in the past institute in the institute of the institute in the institute of the institute in the institute of the institute in the institute of the institute in the institute of the institute in the institute of the institute in the institute of the institute in the institute of the institute in the institute of the institute in the institute of the institute in the institute of
we have this banner in our office in our office in our office in palo alto , it &apos;s just like we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to introduce the best outcome , and then people tend to make people , these idea of reality .
we &apos;re asking ourselves and giving people to achieve them .
i &apos;ll show you three three games that i designed to try to try to try and try to be able to to a few people in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> that you have to overcome a <unk> .
but the most popular is , but we have enough <unk> , so we have enough <unk> to engage in real time , they tell us where a lot of oil , so they &apos;re killing without oil , so they &apos;re killing without oil , so they &apos;re killing without oil , so they &apos;re killing without oil , so they &apos;re killing without oil , so they &apos;re killing without oil , so they &apos;re killing without oil , so they &apos;re killing without oil , and we &apos;re going to ask you to make it ,
we have this game with daily gamers in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an ecstatic experience .
no one wants to change what life is good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a fork , they &apos;re like , &quot; we are going to look at the oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to go .
find out how they survive , you would survive . the most of our gamers have been completed .
so we have a broader company , a bigger , more collective , unquote , more objective .
we have the game called &quot; <unk> &quot; the institute of institute .
goliath &apos;s the calculation of a truism that people have only photographed for 23 years on the planet .
this is called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; natural , of course .
the call on the player , and then we almost almost like a <unk> <unk> .
you know know , jerry &apos;s jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; <unk> &quot; and just the way that the scientists are the <unk> and only together together the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , every job for energy , we say , every job for energy , we say , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health , health
8,000 <unk> playing the play 8 weeks ago .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read , when they were called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last thing we &apos;re going to bring on the three , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you just get the game , you get from the world bank , the award would be <unk> , &quot; 2010 .
we &apos;re working with the universities in the caribbean , and invite them a to learn social .
we have a comic book . we understand the level of <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , sustainability , sustainability , sustainability and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all the rest of young people , especially in <unk> , all across the world , all across the world , all the world , in <unk> , the world .
i come back to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think , what happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we &apos;ve games that what we can show what we can do , but we can show the real world , but we haven &apos;t even saved the real world .
well , i hope i agree that , that &apos;s why the games are resources that we &apos;re working in real life , able to conduct the real meaning of change , and that is making a big difference for change .
we have this entire superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to the ability to be dyed social networks , <unk> and the desire .
i hope i really play the eminent games to survive on this planet , to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me with me with me playing with me playing with me .
if i go to the next decade , i &apos;m not going to show myself at two things that we can create each of each other , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start with the <unk> games .
thank you .
i would like to tell something something that i &apos;ve introduced a few months ago , in the blink of <unk> magazine .
i &apos;ve always been my writing about my <unk> , but i was with the top of the axis , and i &apos;ve never been in my life , i &apos;ve never met in my life , what the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means &quot;
i read the post .
&quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> : &quot; <unk> , bees , , , , , , , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , strong , . &quot;
i &apos;ve got this list of the list of the friend of <unk> and had to take a ridiculous , but i couldn &apos;t try to read and throw it so ridiculous , but i couldn &apos;t try to read and make me and so forth , and so i &apos;ll stop and to read and formally shock .
of course , the <unk> , old <unk> , old <unk> , i just thought that that &apos;s pretty old .
but in fact , there was a critical thing in the early &apos; 80s , when i was just with elementary and and with this , my <unk> outside of my work , my work and global <unk> .
and god &apos;s certainly thank god , i would not use a <unk> .
i would take this post seriously , i would be born in a world that would perceive as if a person would perceive as a person would perceive as a person might perceive the opportunity to make opportunities for the opportunities and the adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i got the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected to do that i &apos;ve been seeing here to find a <unk> .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , they don &apos;t much better .
specifically , i had to words last two words , and &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s what we think about the people we can describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that fits in those words , and how we build these values .
our language change our minds and how we &apos;re the world and the people around us .
many of the greeks , they &apos;ve been used the the the most likely force , including the pronunciation of a strong force because what you have to have a strong force , because what you can do .
so , what do we want to do is -- a disabled people ?
you know , a human <unk> as a child , they could highlight , they &apos;re emotional and ideas .
would you be nice to open the information ?
a person who was for me , was my pediatrician was my pediatrician collaborator sooner in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name of a <unk> , whose name , you can think most americans couldn &apos;t answer dr. zullinger .
and dr. <unk> was always very colorful flies and was very colorful flies and was for work for the work with children just like .
i found time i found myself in this hospital , just like -- to my <unk> .
i had to add individual to each other , in different different words with these new regime -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- in different colors than everything else . i googled you .
and imagine if i was a <unk> child with dr. zullinger , with dr. zullinger , and so trying to stop this , <unk> without no avail .
and one day he was just in a of my favorite -- these kinds of fact -- these things were just and <unk> and <unk> -- and he said , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , and young girls , you &apos;ll give birth one day one day one day one day one day .
and if you can make it , i &apos;ll give a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick of dr. seuss , so i &apos;m going to do that , i didn &apos;t want to do that , with the <unk> , who &apos;s not going to be stick in the second , but he was actually designed to see my daily <unk> <unk> with new eyes , so that &apos;s going to see a new drug and <unk> experience .
and i &apos;m going to show you today how much his vision of me as a strong and <unk> young girl from me as a strong and passionate young girl from the way to <unk> and <unk> .
this is just a example of how to develop adults in the <unk> of a child .
but as the same as the <unk> <unk> examples of the <unk> prove , we don &apos;t think our language would all wish , which we all would would ask all of us would all wish to see themselves as humans .
our language is <unk> social change in many cases that are in many instances of a technological narrative .
from medical perspective , from the medical collection of study from titan and artificial <unk> <unk> , who has been <unk> <unk> , <unk> , connecting their ability to use social destiny , connecting from titan and artificial <unk> , to the limits of titan , connecting to their own destiny , connecting the <unk> , <unk> their natural fate , connecting the limits of titan , <unk> , people themselves , and dissolves around the world of groups , and dissolves in groups they &apos;re themselves .
so maybe you &apos;re interested in this technological transformation , clearly , clearly , that every person can do is quite dramatic and very sophisticated and very sophisticated and very sophisticated and the human capacity , and that the human capacity , our greatest plus our greatest plus .
the human skill is -- this is a story story -- this is a story about a story , because it never occurred to tell you something that are asking me and i &apos;m going to tell you something that are asking me and i &apos;m always felt about that , the questions of people , and i think i understand why i understand why .
this sentence from the <unk> of the idea of the idea that success was to be the idea of golf amounts of the stream , and as if my life is so successful , a challenge , trying to be more likely to be more likely to be the kinds of life with a prosthetic , or whatever people are supposed to perceive .
but the truth is that we are changing . we &apos;re from the challenge of natural resources , whether they &apos;re injured or even both selection .
and i &apos;m saying that that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not a barrier that we need to do to get to come to the lives .
<unk> is just to live .
and i tend to see it , <unk> <unk> .
sometimes i &apos;m going to see that it &apos;s very , sometimes it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not seen , but it &apos;s all about the alignment of me .
and i want to show that the impact is the severe <unk> of a human .
there are in life and challenges , and challenges , and each person is different from it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re not comfortable with <unk> or not , but as we do it with it .
so we are not just trying to do it , which we love to love , but they &apos;re helping to keep the time , they also helped us to come to come good .
and we &apos;re going to do our children unless we give them feel that they can &apos;t adapt to .
you need two things : for a medical fact , for a medical and to another , and the other thing about whether i &apos;m not going to talk about whether i &apos;m not going to talk about whether i &apos;m not going to be a no-brainer or not .
and to be honest , the only real and the power of disability that i had to get to the world , and the world is constantly the world , they can describe me .
in our wish , people who are trying to protect us the heart , or even a joke of quality of life , or even a convenient to provide the quality of the quality of life that you do , we have to do that , we need to put hard to somebody else &apos;s actually .
maybe the idea is the concept of concept , which is just trying to conduct what &apos;s going on , and how we repair that , for every single disability that &apos;s a bigger disability than the .
if we don &apos;t have to treat unless we treat a people not treat its forces and possibilities , we can fight the natural , , we might have to be a more disease that you might have to be able to do , a more disease .
we &apos;re <unk> , who has a value for our society .
so we have to look at the <unk> , and we &apos;re all wondering about human possibilities .
but the idea is that it &apos;s between perception of our time and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not decay <unk> or unless we should not otherwise , they should be able to avoid the carpeting , they should be under the carpeting , but it &apos;s about the most vulnerable opportunities .
it &apos;s really about to ask you realize that we &apos;re not necessarily eating not necessarily seals to understand , but we &apos;re discussing for them to hug a <unk> and maybe even able to use a <unk> and possibly even seeking .
and perhaps we &apos;re going to create it , <unk> , as natural natural natural natural natural natural and disappointments and feel like that not
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . and he years ago , and he was darwin , and he was darwin , has darwin , in my eyes , a little different human life .
i would like to talk about this : not the idea of its kind of m , and not the <unk> of its best minds .
curves creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s darwin &apos;s shocking code , and <unk> , and <unk> , of course , from the fight of the human mind , is the most efficient of the human mind is , is to navigate itself .
so , again , transformation and nitrogen are the most profound skills of humans .
and perhaps we know , we &apos;re going to do , we &apos;re really going to be a <unk> .
it &apos;s just the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of the <unk> , a sense of the <unk> , a sense of our own force .
we can give us this way .
we can give <unk> a new meaning that &apos;s about 300 times .
maybe we can see <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are on a transformation that we haven &apos;t yet been adapted .
i think the biggest countries we &apos;ve been ourselves , we have to humanize ourselves , is that we should be normal .
and so , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the real key . the typical and would they really know that . but they would really want to learn that poor , the outcome , really want to know if they really want to be ?
i think , rather than i think .
it would be neat if we use this paradigm against another , and even a bit of the level of children , and they can invite the power of a bit of children , and they can invite the power of a bit of children , and they &apos;re going to do their own skills and the <unk> skills in the society .
<unk> found out that we found humans from the members of our society , always to be useful to be useful and a half .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals of the neanderthal and human people with the neanderthal , older people with heavy years , and maybe the happened in the <unk> of this human rights , the <unk> of this human rights .
they have no encryption and useless , and they were as something special , and valuable .
a couple years ago , i went to the city , i grew up in a <unk> davis in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was a <unk> tomato sauce in the northeast of pennsylvania .
it was summer and i was <unk> .
and i hear that a guy behind me , &quot; well , if you &apos;re not aimee . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to see around and see this older man . i had no idea what he &apos;s .
and i said , &quot; excuse , excuse me , sir , we know ? i don &apos;t remember remember . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you can remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember
when i first saw her first time i saw her from the belly of her mother &apos;s day . &quot;
oh , so .
and of course , it &apos;s got click .
this was a leader <unk> , a man who i knew about this day because i was of course , i was , of course , i was of course , i was going to last resort to late weeks weeks .
the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s favorite moments of <unk> <unk> was in the holiday , and so that was the man who was not challenged my dad was not at all .
and i was born without being born , and i went back to them , and i just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just a few toes .
he said to me , &quot; you never walk your parents , and i never wanted to be as much as a result like other kids or something else , or you never have a functional life , and then just just just just just just just just just just just just just me . &quot;
i found that he &apos;s been a <unk> of my entire childhood , which was <unk> <unk> of my own childhood , whether i had my fellowship or a <unk> of my <unk> writer , no matter to teach his my mom or a <unk> of my <unk> , <unk> his dreams or a <unk> of my student , <unk> from the <unk> family and the <unk> medical school .
and he &apos;s got this part of his <unk> <unk> , the potential of human .
you cannot emphasize , not enough to be able to be able to be able to be a factor of human rights .
and he <unk> , he said , &quot; i learned that kids can get them to get else else , and if you &apos;re just a little bit of the other , you know , if you get kids themselves , you can get kids , then children can achieve very much . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed .
he had understood that the medical of the public , and how someone else starts to deal with two different things .
and i also have my thinking at the time , when you were asked me at age 15 years , when you were asked for me at the age of 15 , i couldn &apos;t have legs from the legs from the legs from the flesh and bones , i couldn &apos;t have a second .
i was going to be necessarily normal .
if you ask me , if you ask me , i &apos;m not sure .
and this is because i &apos;ve been doing something with my legs and not despite that simulation .
and maybe this change that , because i &apos;m so many people because i &apos;m so many people to have a <unk> , instead of making people who were me or something really useful .
see , it really takes a people who really need to get their powers , you can become your powers , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow it to someone to someone , your own mind is so -- if you open the way for someone to lever -- if you open the way for someone in a moment , they are a very good teachers , they &apos;re responsible for these people .
they &apos;re going to open up scenarios .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; meen &quot; the word &quot; meen &quot;
it means something that is something that is in a sense , the potential of the potential .
again , again , again , what potential would we want to do ?
in the 1960s , in britain was a retired of time , and then they were <unk> in <unk> .
they call this there called <unk> <unk> , &quot; in the united states we call the as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re going to <unk> the christian .
and the one has students <unk> <unk> , who are the better teachers teachers , get the better teachers .
they &apos;ve got a <unk> period with a whirlwind heap , &quot; she was very good , &quot; it was told you , they were very good , they were very clever , they were very clever , and after that three months , they were really upset .
and of course , it follows it to be a heart attack that the most important thing that they were just accommodates .
and so , as they did it .
but only those who are still in school -- except that would be from the students that had been school .
and this is true , in this study that was not gavage <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something changed .
just you just became just to just the students that are the students with the grade , and they have them something they treated them .
the only real real time is a <unk> spirit , a wise <unk> , he &apos;s missing more <unk> , and he &apos;s missing more <unk> , the broken , and our innate capacity of the world .
if we can do it , the human spirit , they &apos;re able to engage themselves and other people around themselves , to find other people around and <unk> , to be a <unk> , we added our powers in a positive .
if a spirit of humanity , we can create a new insight and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem called <unk> , <unk> , the god , not the god of an undergraduate poet called <unk> , but the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the god , dance with me . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you be better than you want to be ?
i realize , i said that , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory , a better memory system -- and inevitably is speeding up .
or they want to be <unk> , more force .
would you want to be confident and confident ?
how about it was going to be in good health care ?
or maybe you &apos;re a bunch of that that has been looking at the more creativity .
what would you like ?
which would you like to have like to have like , if you can only have a guess if you could only have a ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
please raise your hands . let me see .
a few of them probably about this many many people here .
this is very good .
how many of you would decide to decide ?
just a few more .
how about it ?
a few of a few .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority of the majority . the <unk> , as a doctor .
if you just one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this all right ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> theme here on the ted , but today , i want to show you the legacy of a doctor &apos;s view .
the big brands in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a grant in the russian <unk> , who was a grant in the russian <unk> church , and the one day that nothing in biology , no sense of any sense in the evolution of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re a of which you &apos;re not the proof of which the biological evolution are called a very good scientist , and you may permission to the first <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and you may have permission to say , you can get permission to think , because nothing &apos;s going to talk about , because nothing &apos;s going to do .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think it &apos;s the following , it &apos;s just about the past , or the way the future ?
is it for other <unk> or the way that &apos;s us ?
this is another view of life .
in this painting , i &apos;ve got a bush as a writer of the helicopter <unk> in evolutionary evolutionary evolutionary times , because if you look at the edges of life , all the <unk> <unk> in evolutionary evolutionary report , in evolutionary evolutionary report : they survived , it has a local fitness and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most of the most .
we &apos;ve just been making a shared ancestor about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there was maybe 20 or 25 different types of hominids .
some of these are .
we are for about a decade of <unk> years .
it seems like we were sure , we &apos;re reasonably passionate about the other parts of life , but actually actually the basic mechanisms , the basic mechanisms , our cells are quite equal .
is you realize that we can draw and create the mechanisms of a collective <unk> mesh to produce the protein of human capacity to produce the protein of human capacity to treat the food ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same code that is chemically a chemically deep <unk> from what comes from the pancreas .
and we &apos;re talking about bacteria , and they &apos;re aware of us in our gut , more than it cells in our gut than it &apos;s going to be a vascular body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , think , if antonio damasio is the same time , they think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a beautiful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s constant , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re all nutrients that they could only provide a without effort .
it &apos;s really a mild way for bacteria , with private , with the <unk> of the <unk> , forced to be the naked .
but else , you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping in the basic nutrients , <unk> nutrients . and they protect them against the way against the way .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that might even better occur into the environment ?
now , we &apos;re going to take a step back to the big seven trillion trillion years ago -- the earth , maybe three billion years ago , maybe , maybe a few hundred billion organisms organisms , maybe so much as a longer or a billion years ago , maybe the human species , which is the human species , which is the human enterprise .
in this gargantuan current symphony , symphony , the life on earth only exists on earth just briefly , is the animal on earth ; the animal , as a human and human life , a small <unk> .
we were we .
this represents the <unk> of this talk , so i hope you &apos;ll have to multiply it .
well , i think , as i was on the college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell into the power of evolution , and i realize something very fundamental : in <unk> organisms , the existence of the existence in <unk> organisms , and all the genetic information will continue to grow up into the soviet union .
but at the time , when a <unk> organisms , they began to change the things .
misuse of the reproduction are the painting .
and importantly , with the advent of sexual remarks , the genome , the genome is , the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the core of the death of the body of the body of the body is the same time .
now i &apos;ve got to find if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , death for sex -- it seemed , okay , death for sex -- it seemed to say , but with every year , but with every year , but with every year , i guess with every year , it &apos;s too short .
i &apos;m also exploring the feelings of george burns , who was in las vegas vegas his show his show in las vegas .
and one night , is there a pat on its own .
he &apos;s open door .
arrest him a beautiful <unk> <unk> .
she looks at it , and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is beautiful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the yeast . &quot;
i was thinking about the realization that i was a goal of <unk> that was very different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily necessarily , except in the evolution of the evolution .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to think .
i wanted to design the health of a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the way of the ocean that &apos;s the potential generation , and we &apos;re going generation after generation .
and from a great perspective , and i like <unk> rockets to the genetic <unk> , to the genetic temperature in the next stage to send to the ocean .
i think we would all have the mood that everybody &apos;s the <unk> of all the way that i understand the users , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get to my work .
i want to die , i want to die . &quot;
evolution is not necessarily necessarily necessarily the lack of life .
it &apos;s not necessarily inevitably the biggest <unk> , the <unk> or the fastest , or the fastest , and not even the subject .
evolution <unk> the creatures that are best to adjust their environment .
it &apos;s the test of survival and succeeding .
on the basis of the ocean , bacteria are bacteria , if the <unk> are the <unk> , when the <unk> are <unk> and <unk> , when the vacuum bar , it would be like the way to do it .
so , what does that mean , if we look at the beginning , what happens about the place of people in evolution , and how we talk about the people in evolution , and we especially <unk> in the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of opportunities .
the first is that we don &apos;t get us .
we have a kind of balance .
and the reasons that it would be that it would be us through a lot of genes , to get the amount of genes that had been trained and had been out of the population , and from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the population , from the
and secondly , we have a species of opportunity , we &apos;ve been able to do it , we &apos;ve been able to do that , we &apos;ve been able to adapt to them .
and by the way , we &apos;re able to recruit and mix and ngos and mix of so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary , for the evolution of <unk> .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s a evolution of traditional , of course , of course , the power of nature .
and the argument , here &apos;s the the the the the the the evolution of evolution are the right place of the right to the right speed .
and so far the isolation that we are as a whole bunch of distant planets , and the change the change the change the evolution of the environment that evolution was natural .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> , and scary , because of course , it &apos;s terrifying .
i call it <unk> -- the new development isn &apos;t easy , but it &apos;s not easy to the decisions that we &apos;re going to do .
now , how could you do ?
how could it possible that we do this ?
we look at the reality that people are going to be about their offspring , and they &apos;re doing decisions about their progeny .
they &apos;re in some cultures , the choice , to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the ct and the family .
so think if it &apos;s not just possible to vote the gender of your child and poetry , the disease , the disease and prevent the disease .
what if they could do the genetic change change or parkinson &apos;s disease or parkinson &apos;s disease or parkinson &apos;s disease or a palestinian or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other or the other
would you want to do it to do this change in your genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be possible .
the human genome began in 1990 and it took 13 years ago .
it &apos;s a cost of <unk> billion dollar .
in the following year , when it was done before 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in a <unk> .
today , you can charge a sequence of three billion dollars for the human genome , for example , and in the room of about 50 dollars , and in the room of a week .
it &apos;s not going to continue to continue to be able to be the 1,000 dollars , until the other three dollars , and it will be increasingly tempting to each other .
one week , the national academy of the <unk> of francis <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , two scientists , two scientists , two scientists , two scientists , two scientists , two scientists , two scientists , to live in a fashion fashion -- which is called <unk> , &quot; afterlife . &quot;
a couple of years was took a adult <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of four photos he took the cell to a cell potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially
these are in the middle of the icefall .
the same technology that can produce human insulin on bacteria , which is not only protection that can &apos;t only protection itself protection , but also unimaginable to serve the rest against others .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in a gang study in a <unk> , in the cells of a <unk> <unk> .
can you imagine something good , the tobacco ?
this is now everything reality and today is much more possible .
so , imagine two different changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what would you be able to change your cells ?
what if you could the <unk> and <unk> or the <unk> <unk> , to give your children to provide a better chance to provide their children , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be a healthier ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science , the same motor of science , to prevent disease , could prevent disease , <unk> -- also , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why not the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , if you can &apos;t afford to restore it , especially when you take it to the next generation of the <unk> ?
why not the fast that have been <unk> that can be scanned and richer longer ?
why not we live longer ?
this will be <unk> .
and if we are at a place where we can go to the next generation , and we can collect the the the attributes of the attributes of the we want to make it by <unk> evolution evolution .
we &apos;ll eat a process that can &apos;t afford to the rule , and we can afford it on a thousand years , and perhaps , for the next 100 years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren are being produced by their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , they need to be a <unk> .
are we use this decisions , the better , is better , is the better successful is that the death ?
or we will choose a zillion different attributes of the time we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
will we get a society , and <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be understood .
and on , on all , we &apos;ll ever be able to develop wisdom , the wisdom and wisdom , we need to be able to make this decisions ?
in the good as they &apos;re in the evil , and they may be thinking about , these decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a little robot , a portable robot , which gives you the current skills of time , or another direct , the <unk> , and to go back to the .
we call this robot , these robots .
they &apos;re nothing else as a little bit of something that you will see in the morning and you get <unk> strength and that will help you to think about the speed of your balance .
this is indeed the true encyclopedia of human and machine .
but not only that -- so , so it &apos;s going to merge and other kinds of devices .
this is not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re going to talk about the american soldiers in the average , the average of his back in his back , and it &apos;s the ones that they should have more ease .
of course , this is too few -- 30 percent -- 30 percent of this -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought that we would take us to think that we would take us to think , and a <unk> that help help prevent this problem with this problem .
so let me show you now , or the human universal <unk> .
rs : i can take 200 pounds of <unk> , and many hours of the week .
so , his flexible design allows to allow deep to the , and <unk> <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go to and then my strength and then my strength and perseverance .
we are far , with our <unk> , this new <unk> <unk> that year .
so it &apos;s true .
let &apos;s look at our view on the wheelchair , something i &apos;m specifically to do it .
there are 68 million people , the world in the wheelchair .
this is about a percent of the population .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talk about young people with spinal persons , the <unk> of spinal people with spinal persons -- -- and the wheelchair is the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the time to get their numbers .
and so quite the only option -- if it &apos;s a <unk> , or something else -- is the wheelchair .
and so , it &apos;s the way for 500 years , since the way i &apos;ve got to say , very successful .
so we thought that we could start with this , a whole new tool to code in the field of mobility .
now , let me introduce you now , the sport <unk> , the 19 years ago , which was 19 years ago , the result she couldn &apos;t run to run to run to run to run to run to run to run to run to run over 19 and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda kitts contributes to our <unk> .
it &apos;s got sensors .
his <unk> <unk> sensors in the crutches , which is the <unk> <unk> of the signals that &apos;s sitting here in the back of the back here .
here are also <unk> that the <unk> is changing the <unk> , and also like the clock in your <unk> , which they move forward in this fairly <unk> , very natural .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> <unk> during a <unk> <unk> .
in the fraction of a second , i can make any sense and every movement of my <unk> .
not long after my favorite , and he said , &quot; amanda said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back to go back . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s <unk> every culinary hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technology has helped me to learn back to learning , again , again , to climb back to 5,000 and even the the the the the the line .
but nothing was invented me , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have technology we have the technology , we have the platforms to discuss ourselves and connecting to them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the entire potential to change life , to change life , to change life , or for amanda and all the wheelchair , or for amanda and all the wheelchair , but all the wheelchair .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m worried of the most exciting organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t have poverty poverty , i <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> at a volunteer at a volunteer at a volunteer at a volunteer .
now , in our city , in our city , they have to implement a early in a <unk> , , you have to be quite early on the <unk> to be able to be able to escape .
i remember my first fire fire .
i was the second volunteer , the <unk> , i had fairly good opportunities .
but it was still another one of the <unk> <unk> and figure out what our team should be .
when i was the <unk> <unk> , he was just in a very serious entertainment , which was the most of the worst days of their life .
it was a prototype in the night , and she stood in the <unk> and the <unk> under a neanderthal rain , in the field of rain , in the field of the house .
the other guy who had me arrived -- we call him -- the <unk> <unk> , who was demolished to the <unk> <unk> , and was asked to save the dog to rescue the dog .
the dog ! i was lost .
there was a lawyer or <unk> , who could tell people in a house , to save a living house to save a living house , just because he could tell five seconds , just as i was .
well , i was the next thing .
the <unk> <unk> me to remember .
he said , &quot; hey , you have to go into the house .
you need to go up to the fire , and you have to get a few different set of shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
well , not exactly what i &apos;ve been described to me , but i went to the real <unk> , &quot; the &quot; real &quot; <unk> , &quot; the &quot; <unk> <unk> , who had quite ready to get the bedroom to catch a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i just wearing my shoes back down , where i was going to take my three , and the ocean .
we need to look at our <unk> , where , not surprisingly , but not surprisingly , its more attention than my life .
a couple weeks later , received the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> where they settled into the ultimate seat where they were <unk> .
a more confident shame : someone had a few shoes .
in my view , robin hood , as a volunteer word , i &apos;m a bunch of generosity and integration in the big scale , but i also see as a symbol of generosity and the <unk> of a single .
and do you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , if i look at this room , and people see that people who have been reached a <unk> or on your way , or on your journey , or on your way i don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to do that , you wait to make a difference in life , until they &apos;ve reached the first million people .
if you give you something like you &apos;ve got it .
you &apos;re going to be in a high-speed <unk> , you can go .
just take a mentor .
not every day , each opportunity will provide a chance to save life , saving a day , but each day we can change the opportunity to change .
so they put it . you &apos;re going to walk through the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i come back from a community , the secret of the human .
a place where the women are the <unk> , with sex , with sex , with sex , and the game is the day , where is fun a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not organic <unk> , or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your blood flow .
this is the world of the subject of congo in the world .
bonobos are about chimpanzees , our next living relative .
that means we have a shared ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother that &apos;s evolutionary years about six million years ago .
well , there are known known for your <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this <unk> <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos , let &apos;s show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzee in large , dread <unk> , led to the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
and that &apos;s really what it really creates what emerges with this , because that &apos;s a <unk> violence in which has been not seen .
but unfortunately , bonobos are bonobos , under the primate .
they live in the deep sea , <unk> , and the observation only accessible hard to the observation .
the congo is an paradox -- a country -- a country and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the trial of darkness itself -- the mid- of a violent opportunity that has been since the first world war .
it surprises not that these destruction also survive survive , the survival of bonobos .
<unk> and the character of the achondroplasia lead to the <unk> , they don &apos;t even have a stadium with the <unk> , and we &apos;re not secure to be honest .
and yet , in this country , and it &apos;s a <unk> laugh , the <unk> laughter , the trees .
who are these relatives ?
we know as a love of war &quot; because they were <unk> , because they have <unk> sex partners , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and they &apos;re also so <unk> and <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that this would be completely humanitarian , because the life is the life of the bonobos from more than the permafrost .
bonobos -- how people -- love to play their lives .
play , not just <unk> .
for us and it &apos;s game by relationships for the attachment of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
play creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s about the great diversity of diversity -- diversity , diversity , diversity , diversity .
and if you &apos;re bonobos , you can see the evolutionary origins of human human human , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance , dance ,
play is the <unk> , the <unk> .
well i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to play a few new footage of the wild .
first , a <unk> <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we are a young females and males in a <unk> .
see what they do .
this could be the evolutionary origins of the &quot; : &quot; you &apos;re just rubbing him to the eggs . &quot;
i just think that i tend to be more like , isn &apos;t it .
yeah !
so mendel , they &apos;re <unk> , both as a human being .
and this video is really interesting , because it &apos;s really interesting , because it &apos;s really interesting , because it shows the <unk> that -- as the -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the -- and also , as the game both <unk> both of humanity as well -- and more fun , it &apos;s cheaper to do .
but the game is a <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and it can take a lot of a kind of shapes that some of the things are , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , curious , curious , curious , curious , curious , altruism .
and i want to show you that is <unk> , a young female , a young female , and they operate with water .
i think it &apos;s just like , we sometimes alone , and we <unk> <unk> and the worlds of our inner inner worlds .
and it &apos;s this cutting curiosity , which is the us to allow us to be the <unk> , and the limitations of that we &apos;re willing to do is the actual commons of creativity .
this is just a little <unk> on the insights that are interpreting in our past and present .
but they also true for our future , a future where we need to adapt to z challenges , through z challenges , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through creativity , through
the secret is that the game is the game of the key to the key to this skills .
in other words , play play , play is our <unk> .
to translate us to work together , we have to play .
but will we do this , from our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
and the people are equally organic to life , and claws .
right now , if it &apos;s not appropriate appropriate , it &apos;s game .
and so , my <unk> , let &apos;s take this map of evolution and collectively play , as we move the creativity and the communal <unk> .
thank you .
i want you to imagine that they &apos;re two pairs , in exactly the same moment , the same day , in exactly every baby &apos;s baby , a baby &apos;s car .
so two pairs , every communicator tab .
now i don &apos;t want to take you to the <unk> , because if you &apos;re all the time the time , because if you &apos;re all the time of the time , they won &apos;t listen to me .
so imagine that this is just a moment .
and in this scenario , they represent a y <unk> that &apos;s a y <unk> <unk> that &apos;s on the the the the the the night chromosome .
and in the other case , they took the x chromosome , which is the lowest chromosome on the table .
both are <unk> , both of the .
we &apos;re coming later , again , we &apos;ll get back to these people .
and most of my activities have been two .
under a hat , i &apos;m going to talk about history .
i &apos;m studying <unk> , and i &apos;m going to how people are acting with anatomy -- so how people should be <unk> -- so they &apos;re <unk> human bodies , with <unk> , with <unk> , like they &apos;ve been talking about .
the other cap , i &apos;m going to end up with my work , as a <unk> -- or how i sometimes sometimes say , as a prisoner &apos;s purges -- from people who are unemployed by physicians .
in this case , i worked with people who have been working with people who have the <unk> , the social norms .
so i &apos;ve been working for examples , the <unk> twins , two people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> , so people who were smaller than the normal .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with <unk> people whose gender centers -- so people who are -- people who couldn &apos;t predict the benefits of the valued , female <unk> .
and as general , we can use word the word .
<unk> comes into a different shapes .
i just give you some examples of the kinds of <unk> that are not fighting roots or female .
in a case , someone &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene , the <unk> gene , the <unk> gene , the <unk> that we all have to be the <unk> , which we all have to be used to the other day , too , to the testes .
and so , the testes of the testicles in the <unk> stadium .
but because because because because because these individual lack of the testosterone is not confined to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but not a response to it .
as a consequence , the body evolved to the typical female female female characters .
if the kid is born , they &apos;ll look like a girl .
it &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s going to be a girl .
but it takes us to the point of the time , and their breasts grow , they grow , they grow their atomic , and somebody &apos;s something that &apos;s happening .
and they &apos;re doing some tests and find out that they instead instead of <unk> and and <unk> , in fact , they &apos;re in the shortest chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could think that person could be able to hold this person , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our body has something that you say .
they &apos;re in the field of your body .
and the <unk> represent <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most of the women , like i &apos;m -- i think a typical woman not , but i don &apos;t know my weight <unk> , but i think i probably probably the typical women like i was actually on the <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
the implication is that somebody has actually been a brain that has been exposed to be exposed to be exposed to be exposed to <unk> , than a woman who has been born with no .
so , in order to really complicated complicated , not just in the middle of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the whole range of -- in a sense , can be distributed .
another example : a few years ago , i received a a few years ago , he had a girlfriend , who was born a friend of man who he was born , who had a girlfriend with his girlfriend , and as a boy , he had a uterus .
he had a extreme form of a <unk> .
he has <unk> <unk> , and in utero , his harrowing was so much active that they have a male <unk> .
and when the consequence was his <unk> his greatest preacher , his brain was part of the <unk> male male effects of the brain .
and when he was born , he saw a boy from a boy , &quot; no one knew something .
and just as he was 19 , he was enough medical problems , actually enough problems , actually enough problems , actually , because he found that he was in the interior .
okay , just a quick sample of <unk> for a creation of <unk> .
some people are <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and also something that &apos;s called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so , in many different varieties , they &apos;re planning in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of bodies , -- -- and of surgeons are often -- often about surgeons in surgeons &apos; powerpoint of surgeons , isn &apos;t because this was the physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason they often have different species , because they &apos;re going to be different species , because they &apos;re our social impact .
urbanization is just based on the idea that a particular platform is generating the particular sheet of the united states with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman has a woman identity ; a black person , a black person to be , &quot; governing , a wealthy anatomy in the history of your story .
so we have this awful <unk> idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body of the way , which is something very different , confused , gender , frightening us in the category .
so we have a lot of new ideas about <unk> ideas .
and our nation is really a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how technically it is , when children are born , the two persons in a body , the two persons in a body .
where i had been presented to the most of the most <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , was the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , whose gender was in berlin in 2008 in 2008 .
many journalists are asked me to say , &quot; what test you do : &quot; what test you do , the idea of whether or manly ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that there &apos;s not available .
we already know that gender is that we must admit that gender complicated is worth manly and we need to admit that nature for us to be manly and female , or between manly and and and and and and and and <unk> ; we &apos;re doing it , which is what we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are , we are
so we have a situation where we need to be so , we need to be so easy to honor to admit that these categories that we have created categories that these categories that we &apos;ve got the very simple <unk> suits of the <unk> expressway to create much more livable than we have .
and this is not just in terms of gender .
it also applies to think of the most complicated as much more complicated than our <unk> .
at our , we &apos;ve got to <unk> into all kinds of peer-reviewed areas areas .
we &apos;re going to take billions of examples that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with the <unk> .
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re just to get us through few pies ?
as we move our science , we &apos;re going to change into a zone where we need to work in a zone where we need to the <unk> categories that we were able to do .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the most dramatic things we see the <unk> vision , in our current united states , in the world , the future united states , the future of life .
we have tough talking about what to people , and then a body to people , so he was an different right than the life .
we &apos;ve very hard hard to -- maybe not as rigorous as the question -- and over the question , when someone &apos;s dead .
our ancestors had been so hard to fight when somebody was dead .
they have a coke below the nose , under the nose , and when they &apos;re not , they didn &apos;t have to bury them .
if you don &apos;t have a more twisting , you &apos;ve got it .
but today , we &apos;re going to be a situation where we &apos;re making people <unk> <unk> and they other people .
and as a result , we &apos;ve asked ourselves to question when somebody &apos;s dead , and that takes us into a really difficult position where we don &apos;t have a really small job , where we don &apos;t like a deal with the rest of the same way .
now , could you imagine that the entire <unk> of categories would be really happy .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , i &apos;m going to do <unk> people with the lolcats bodies , but i need to admit , it &apos;s really .
and , , what these categories are really more effective than we are .
and it makes me feel about <unk> in terms of balance .
so to tell you about this , i &apos;ve got to make sure that i first got a big fan of the founding .
i know you were hoping , i know you were hoping that they were , but they were terrific .
i think they were so much and strong , and strong enough , which was she was doing all of the <unk> <unk> , and so , what i was doing all of the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not due to forget the music .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening in the process of the <unk> .
the founding case was from my perspective , and it &apos;s not that .
what she was <unk> was a concept of concept , and they were replaced to another , the radical thing , and beautifully and 200 years for us .
as you remember , our founding monarchy of monarchy and the monarchy of monarchy down the monarchy , and the monarchy occurs on a very <unk> concept of anatomy .
the tunisian world didn &apos;t have a concept of the dna , and they had a concept of the <unk> .
it had a concept of the prime blood vessel .
they were the idea of the notion that people who had political power , these political power should have political <unk> from the highest <unk> to son and so on .
the founding <unk> , and they famously had a new concept of concept , and they were replaced by a new concept of being able to be a new concept of the fact that all of us .
she <unk> , and they decided that the fact that the <unk> , the similarity , the similarity , not the gaps . and that was very radical .
now , they did this , because they &apos;re part of a <unk> system , where two things are <unk> together .
democracy grew up , but the same time , the science is .
if you look at the story of the founding , it &apos;s going to be clear that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went from explanations to <unk> , and then <unk> things like a shocking concept of power , where the transmission is a very <unk> of <unk> .
they &apos;re a concept concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they &apos;re talking about nature and the god nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of them , it &apos;s a concept of <unk> <unk> .
and they have really wonderful civil rights movement .
they don &apos;t have this idea about it , but what they &apos;ve done for us .
so what happened to be years ?
for example , women who &apos;s called the <unk> <unk> , which says that we should have been more important than significant that we shouldn &apos;t have the <unk> , the concept of the founding problem that says , is more important than significant enough , is more important than significant , but they said , &quot; that we should be right , etc . &quot;
and women are <unk> the successful .
when next came to the successful civil rights , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who said , &quot; am not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> sky , which says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people are dopamine in the anatomical infected <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we see the same thing in the field .
of course , the problem is that we &apos;re starting to look at all the similarities , we need to ask all the similarities , why we have certain <unk> .
well , i want to feel , i want to be a certain <unk> of that , in our culture .
i want to say , i want to give you a fish , like a fish .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that anesthetics are right to have to have to sex your informed consent or the balkans .
so there &apos;s some anatomic <unk> that &apos;s important for me to make sense , and we think , i think .
but the challenge is , we &apos;re trying to figure out what &apos;s going on , and why we are , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so we come back to this two creatures that was been <unk> .
we have two creatures , both useless , both useless , the same day .
so , we ask ourselves , maria , maria , three months born , three months , so she &apos;s a launch of june , she &apos;s gone down a launch of june .
and henry , on the other side , it &apos;s been born , it &apos;s a 1k of march , so a is the one march of the march of the day .
it &apos;s just about the fact that maria <unk> , they &apos;re all sorts of usable three months ago -- the law three months -- the right sex -- the right sex -- the right to vote .
so , i need to wait this , not because it actually has actually another biological biological age , just because of the birth of his birth .
we find other <unk> in terms of what their rights .
so , you know , you &apos;re going to be a <unk> that he &apos;s going to be , although i don &apos;t have told you that he &apos;s going to be able to get the box of the <unk> -- that &apos;s going to be , &quot; the time you have to worry about the aircraft .
maria <unk> , cannot use all of the same right now , cannot perceive the current , and that &apos;s right to marry that right .
a henry can marry in every country , a woman , but maria can just landed in a few weeks ago .
so we have these <unk> <unk> categories that are problematic in the lancet of <unk> .
and for me , the question is , what do we do , because our science crisis we need to say , because our science is that we need to say that democracy can be on the anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give science science , but it feels sometimes as if the science is expanding .
so where do we do ?
it seems like our culture : &quot; good , we need to pull somewhere somewhere somewhere , we need to pull somewhere else , so we prefer . &quot;
but a lot of people who are sitting in a very strange position .
so , texas , texas , it has a y dashboard , you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and a woman cry at marry , and a woman &apos;s a y chromosome .
now , in practice , people don &apos;t get to be embarrassed .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because the story that i told you about the <unk> .
if we look at a pleasant of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he would have to talk about this &quot; a dream of the solution . &quot;
he says , we should not ask people to your skin , but after the usual heart , but after the usual heart , &quot; and it &apos;s going to be about anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you ask people to their psa ?
i want to make it feel like that i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;m not sure that i have to make a series of a series of <unk> <unk> , which is probably more likely to make a series of more than some people that i know .
i want to argue that i &apos;m probably a few of the fact that are <unk> <unk> , and also to make a few basic relationships , and also , decisions about sexual <unk> that i know .
so how do we get the question to the the qualities ?
it turns out as a really difficult thing .
and part of what would be if the content was something that would be something that would be in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future , in the future ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure we &apos;re going to go .
what i know , is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the united states is the united states is about questions about questions about questions .
in our time , we have a good job , and i think we would really think our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like it for instance , where a man who gets attracted to other men , wherein a man who gets attracted to other men , with death , unless it &apos;s ready to do a <unk> , where he was alive .
no control of exist not fighting .
i &apos;m happy to say that we cannot say that we don &apos;t have this states , a surgeon that we don &apos;t have a few years ago , the <unk> twins had to make a name .
but when i was with him , and i asked him why he &apos;s highly <unk> -- it was highly <unk> -- it was highly <unk> -- it was very badly , that children were very , very bad , and he had to do it .
i replied , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got a paper in the way a surgery ? &quot;
the united states are unbelievable incredible opportunities to be the ones that they are changing around without that they &apos;re just to be the point of the state .
so i think we have to be careful .
well , just to be in the , i want to realize that i &apos;ve been very much about the fathers of the dads .
and i want to think about the ways of possibilities , or even if we could have mothers more .
and i want to say something that &apos;s a feminist problem is something radically is , and i think i could give you the kinds of different kinds of different species of anatomy , <unk> when people do a <unk> .
since years , i was interested in <unk> , because i was interested in <unk> research in the field of the field .
and one of the things that i really interesting about is the difference between men and women in the way in the way , how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;re from <unk> studies , is that women , in average -- more complex social relationships , not any , but in the average , govern , govern social relationships , the most social relationships and the care for people who are vulnerable to do very much attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have a interesting situation .
years ago , when i was a tour of my graduate student , i was a physicist asked to teach me as a feminist , so that &apos;s how do it really cool question .
he said , &quot; tell me what about the feminism is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i ever heard .
in the debate , it &apos;s about gender , so i don &apos;t have stereotypes about gender , so it &apos;s not a female .
but i ever wondered about his question , so i thought that there were something worthy of the longest thing .
this should be the ross , it could be something that female brains of male value , which makes us cultured social relationships for civic power , and <unk> for it to care .
so , where the founding is extremely shocking , trying to figure out how individuals could be able to figure out , as individuals , it &apos;s possible to find more than we could argue , we just not just like you protecting , but as we can care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we &apos;re going to go to the future , when we feed about anatomy -- less about the individual body , to seek about individual bodies , and more about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re trying to do a <unk> connection , we &apos;re thinking about what we do .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve been looking at it , i &apos;m going to make a very clear , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to dedicate this , to provide any opportunity to carry on other <unk> , and in the time , and over time and <unk> .
but i won &apos;t new .
i get all my clothes from the second hand , and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allowed me to illustrate the impact of my <unk> to the environment and the <unk> .
i all kinds of people , and my little soap for the local for a good , i &apos;m pretty unique , and it &apos;s pretty unique to my own personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to do today ?
is it going to have my size ?
am i going to paint the color ?
is it less than 20 dollars cost ?
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;ve been sitting for this week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with this ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve brought .
i &apos;ve got seven months , and this is all all .
the other thing for a week , all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve been everything i wanted to wear everything i might wear everything i would find everything i would find if i was walking to the palm of the palm .
and since i don &apos;t have to hear from me as the woman who knows here in your underwear -- i found a few things .
and i want to show you my favorite word for this week .
sounds that good ?
as i do , i &apos;m going to show you some of the lessons that i do you whether you believe or not , not , not to carry out of these 17 , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with .
i call the <unk> tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look good .
you can &apos;t look at the less than 50 dollars .
this whole thing , including the <unk> has made me 55 , and it was the most expensive , the most expensive i &apos;ve been sitting in this entire week .
monday : amazing is something .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be a bad thing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> .
if you &apos;re happy , if you &apos;re happy , you prepare other happy people .
tuesday : so , the &apos;s totally <unk> .
i &apos;ve spent very much time of my life lobbying , trying to try and look at the same time , and i want to simplify myself .
just just like you &apos;re .
if you do with the right people , they &apos;re not just understanding , they &apos;re going to estimate .
wednesday : they &apos;re going to kid .
sometimes they tell me me when i &apos;m clicking out , &quot; as if i was going to play the french &apos; games , or i remember their propagating .
i smile and say , &quot; thank you . thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence , the key thing .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something , it &apos;s almost certainly .
and if you think they &apos;re not good at something , you &apos;ve probably right now .
i grew up with a mother that i got to put the day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll be able to wrap it for you .
if you believe you &apos;re going to see , and you &apos;re discussing a wonderful person who is there &apos;s nothing they can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse in this audience here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want to do .
thank you .
friday friday , a universal truth : five : golden words : color-coded <unk> .
and finally , <unk> : a patient , unique , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell something about a word that is going to say about a word .
it became always becoming more and i &apos;ve been dumped when you get week , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great blown up .
clearly this isn &apos;t all in my tiny little suitcase .
so before i go to the brooklyn , i &apos;ll be able to donate everything .
because the lesson that i &apos;ve been able to learn that this is okay , ok , it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t have to weigh these things , because just to the end , it &apos;s always a different set of crazy , <unk> outfit , <unk> outfit , <unk> outfit , and when i was a little love in the heart and it &apos;s looking at .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something i want to show you .
think about the <unk> , as a flying <unk> .
this is what we call mainframe is called <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m thankful , and every hospital in italy , every hospital in italy , and every hospital in italy , every hospital in italy , and every hospital in the middle of a few decades is very powerfully .
and then , sometime , it was so much like they were a formula in a formula , then they took her to her money , then they took her money to a good car .
and if the car and the driver would have enough enough , then they won the race .
now , you need to win , you need a race , some thousand sensors that has a thousand , some thousand sensors that has made a thousand sensors that are going to pass and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and things in real time , to change during the real change .
this would be called a <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , there &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting is interesting , is the <unk> start in our lives .
our cities have been wiped out in the last few years , and electronics with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be able to grasp .
and as a computer , they start to start on other ways , they &apos;ll be the only focus and the .
if we &apos;re cities , if we &apos;re cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
i want to say that cities only two percent of the earth , but 50 percent of the most are only living population there .
they &apos;re <unk> percent of the <unk> -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , pulls all this <unk> and <unk> , and specifically to do a daily life .
this is a from a exhibition that featured paola antonelli later , in the year , in the year .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
now all of our objects , our environment , to speak .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like any of the same as if any of the colors , a sensor , and a <unk> .
and the effect changes the interactions that we &apos;ve got people with our environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old lady of old lady .
you know , as michelangelo , it &apos;s got the baseline , it means that he took the hammer , and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> ? why not you not ? &quot;
now , today , this is how our environment is improving us .
i &apos;m going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and to do it .
let &apos;s start with the beginning .
now the first project i want to show you is in the truth of our labs .
it &apos;s been remembered before , in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done is , was actually a new way of design that was actually a new way of design that &apos;s used in the world , the world , in the world , the <unk> of the <unk> , the corals are going to understand how to understand how to work .
the summer was a a whole summer -- in 2006 .
it was as italy , the cheerleaders .
some of you may remember , it was as italy , as italy , the end of france , and then the end of the <unk> .
and anyway , italy , italy , italy , the end of the end of the end of the end .
now you see what happens on this day , except , just the activity in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
at the morning , the game .
you see the timeline .
in fact , in fact , people here , people here , people here , and they move the phone .
the game is called the silence .
france makes a gateway . italy is a portal .
<unk> , the people who make people doing a short call , go on toilet .
second , the normal <unk> .
first , a number , second .
<unk> , in a moment of the <unk> .
italy is called the italy . yeah .
now , in this night , went to celebrate the center of the center .
they saw the big software .
the next day , all the the the the the the the the <unk> to the <unk> and the prime minister .
and then all the himalaya .
you see the image of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the time , where the time that people people to do -- to have a big party , and you &apos;ll see the end of the day .
now , this is just a example , as we can feel about the city , we can feel the city , we couldn &apos;t have been able to couldn &apos;t have been able to do some years ago .
even quickly another example , another example of the future : there &apos;s not to people , but to use things that we use and consume .
now , we know everything about how our things come .
this is a map that gives you all the chips that can make a mac computer , like they &apos;re together .
but we know , but we know , where the things are going .
so we have a project that &apos;s actually some small impact to the garbage , which is turning through garbage to the system .
so we started with a few volunteers that we start to tag , something more than a year , and the things that they &apos;re <unk> -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you can see -- things that you would throw out .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , on the garbage and start getting it .
here &apos;s the results that we have .
of seattle , of seattle .
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there are a lot of the <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in the opposite energy .
the data weren &apos;t available .
but this is what &apos;s happening , a lot of <unk> <unk> and complicated things .
but the other thing thing is that we believe that if we see every day that we see every day that we throw every day that we &apos;re throw it somewhere else on the planet .
and the plastic that we still have every day .
and if we could , we would have to show the people , we can move a physical attraction .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , could tell you much more about the other part of the world , and the other other things that you can do with , and the many other things we can do , and this is the most egalitarian of our environment .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve got a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it &apos;s starting to be a question of the <unk> , who came out and said that spain and <unk> a nice tradition , in public spaces to use water .
and the question was : how could you technology technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that came in a <unk> , , , , , , , , , , , , imagine <unk> , they lined up these tubes , and the valves , the open and closing .
they &apos;re just like a cardboard camera with <unk> water .
if these <unk> , you can write , you can write it , you can write pictures of pictures .
and you can follow him to follow him , and it &apos;s going to open up to the <unk> , you see see on this painting .
now we have this mayor of <unk> .
it has him very efficient .
and we got to design the mission to design the buildings in the expo .
we called the digital water .
the entire buildings consisted of water .
there &apos;s no minor or the windows , but if you &apos;re going to tell you , it &apos;s open open .
the roof was also covered with water .
and when it &apos;s alarming out , if you want to reduce the failure , you can make the roof down .
or you could download the buildings and the whole architecture is , you know , this days , you get pictures of people who were and the whole architecture , you get pictures of people who were and say , &quot; they have the buildings . &quot;
no , they have &apos;t just throw the buildings , it &apos;s just so that architecture is almost like that architecture .
here you see , how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what happens in the inner .
and here you see me , as i was trying to test the the water that the water is , not getting wet .
well , i should tell you what a truly happened as a <unk> .
but actually , there was a little joke .
all of children are coming from <unk> , because the way they played with the building with the building was entirely different .
not just longer a building that could open them up , but one building that is still , and the rival of the rival , and holes in water , you had to be used to become thrown out .
and this was , very exciting , because when designers , we think about how designers we think about how designers we think about how people are going to be doing things that we create .
but the reality is always improving .
and this is the beauty of the things that are used to create things that are used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s now a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> water from the water water and the projections .
and this is what we &apos;ve followed to do about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
so imagine if they could actually start to fly these <unk> .
imagine imagine you could have little helicopter helicopter , the air , and each of them with a small <unk> with <unk> light , almost like a cloud can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine you imagine a helicopter , as the you alluded to the other , the cyberattacks , fully <unk> .
you can have this cloud .
you can display a kind of <unk> screen , or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or even worse in three dimensions , in the sense , what is changing light , the light is not the position of the <unk> .
they can play with different species .
imagine if you could just look at the screen in different parts or north , in different ways .
but then the whole only one feeds a 3d cloud of <unk> , you can move to the shore , and they move through the circle that you can look at the many ways of numbers .
here you see a real <unk> that &apos;s going to be the <unk> to create a <unk> alarm center .
if you look at the light , it looks like , it &apos;s like we &apos;ve seen before before we &apos;ve seen before .
so imagine that every single individual is going to be broken .
it could be every single <unk> <unk> , which is from people , and then , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people , from people
i want to show you this one of the things here .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best time at the end of our time -- the best <unk> doses of our time in new york and the <unk> of -- we have his motions into 3d to use the motions for the <unk> .
here &apos;s what you see here is dancing .
on the left side , you see the <unk> that are <unk> .
it &apos;s an <unk> and a <unk> .
so they can make the whole movement .
they can do that .
but then once we all have <unk> , they can play with color and engage with color and color .
we want to use this as a kind of stimulus jacket .
i want to show you the latest project that we work .
it &apos;s something we work in london to the olympics olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine that we could do something to do something about something , and the environment change -- almost like we can call it , <unk> , how to move a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that every one of a small donation can be a <unk> .
i think the remarkable of the time last year , which is the last decades of the last decades of digital world are not .
this has been everything , and it &apos;s making it by the internet .
today , we can get the first time -- and the showed -- we can create the vibrational world -- we can create the digital world , from the depletion of the networks .
this can be that we use it to design and create a symbol of a symbol .
this is something which is built in the city .
but tomorrow can get it to represent the ultimate challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we change the digital world .
so the idea is that we actually put people with the people who are doing things .
the cloud is a cloud from the <unk> , in the same way , in the same way , a real cloud .
and these particles are water , whereas our cloud is a cloud .
it &apos;s a perfect line in london , but with <unk> <unk> .
they can move around the inside , different kinds of experiences .
they can actually look at them , the most important moments of <unk> and <unk> sharing the most important moments of the community .
so , both the physical cloud , and something of the time , they can go out how to make a new <unk> .
you can go .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i think is very important .
by my work , i try to express people &apos;s not nature &apos;s not nature &apos;s wiring and all that each other is .
the first time i was about 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first saw my first saw .
i &apos;ve been awe .
my heart , i was irish , i tried to teach my <unk> while me .
the the the the round around <unk> feet from the water , and i was able to prove that this was a snowflake in a different ngo , in the year 2020 .
facebook are born poisonous or by a <unk> , or by by <unk> .
everybody has adapted his own individual personality .
they are interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some people will get up and use of the bitter end , as far as many of the bitter end , and in a colleague of <unk> , <unk> .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re easily varied that they &apos;re yelling , and they &apos;re like we humans see ourselves .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a burst , i &apos;m going to be a <unk> atmosphere .
so as the grim score , it <unk> water , the many of the things that are going to be .
i &apos;m going to go back to my shots , as i would be able to do portraits , in these years ago , in those individual cases they were in charge of these ideas , and they never become so .
it &apos;s not an death when you melt melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a <unk> &apos;s land .
part of the ice in the <unk> i &apos;m going to be <unk> , and some of the thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
and the last pictures i want to show you , i want to show you a iceberg that i &apos;ve been in in the <unk> fields in greenland .
rarely is very rarely , you &apos;re responding to witness in the first place of a <unk> iceberg .
here &apos;s what you see .
on the left side , you see a little quick .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to be able to weep , and the boat is moving to another side .
this is the median size of a <unk> .
he &apos;s like 120,000 foot from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just just like this , you &apos;ll see , you know , you &apos;ll see the iceberg of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really becoming more to some of the work of some of the work in some of the consequences of some of the work .
but when i ever worked on the coolest thing , i went to the guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the mid- &apos; 80s .
then , one day , he came back to the walk back and he said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the .
<unk> is paralyzed .
he can only use his eyes .
i was standing .
i have a company that design and animation , the design is , inevitably , is transfixed a complex part of what we admire in the world and our minds .
we decided to do tony , tony -- and his cause of the thing .
i met with his father and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
i just want to be back to him , and i said , &quot; well , wait , i &apos;m not stephen -- can &apos;t be seen -- can &apos;t be all the people with this machine ? &quot;
and he replied , &quot; no , you just see if you &apos;re going to get to the higher distribution of the principals and an amazing insurance , you can do this really .
normal people aren &apos;t accessible to the machine . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you get ? &quot;
anybody wrote the film , the film , and <unk> &quot;
so they communicate with the same way , so that &apos;s how much as a finger .
i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the pathologist , just a toy , and i made a hint of the rest of the i couldn &apos;t know the <unk> the <unk> , like i should be supposed to be .
i &apos;m committing to place and ask his brother and his brother -- and his dad -- &quot; well , my proposal is : &quot; tony , we &apos;ll be speaking , &quot; tony , we &apos;ll find a little independent , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s communicated . &quot;
so i spoke to you , some months later , a conference later .
i met these guys from <unk> , graffiti research and they have a technology to make a technology to make light up every light on each surface , the only the negative structure .
so they &apos;re making it and make more like this .
they say , all things that there are all the things that will follow .
it starts with the testes , then the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , and the most people actually have .
but there was always a life in their presentations .
so i went home to the patient and told my wife and told me , &quot; well , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , we should find a laser , so that he can do that , so that he can do that , so that he can do that , so that he can do that , and that would be a brilliant . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of partnerships , after a lot of organization , we have some things .
first , we have the <unk> <unk> , and actually , in fact , actually the <unk> <unk> , and actually , for a a stephen <unk> .
this was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it , because you talk about it , or gets a email , or get a email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this chap . &quot;
we &apos;ve been seven <unk> from the world &apos;s the world &apos;s the world &apos;s the world -- literally from the world -- and us home .
my wife , my kids and i went into the garage , and i went into the garage and <unk> and <unk> , our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid , and we all the images of the images of the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for two weeks , we have programmed to the <unk> in the lab , my kids were trying to be the dog , and we created this right here .
it &apos;s called <unk> and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the wheel of venice , which we bought the <unk> of venice from the <unk> and the <unk> .
we punched a <unk> , you &apos;ve got a <unk> , you can build it , and now we have a device for a device we can build the code , we can build the code , we can create the code of the software that software can download free .
so we have a device that completely farthest out of limitations .
no insurance can sprinkle <unk> .
even a hospital .
each of all , now , everybody can communicate with your eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so on the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else is .
there &apos;s all this <unk> , the big seal gave the big seal .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks ago , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , tony &apos;s first reignited seven times .
and this is a musical picture , because this is his life , and it &apos;s about his life .
we have his bed , so that it can see out .
we have a ping-pong plan against a wall of the <unk> in the hospital .
and he went back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what a sense that was on the smallest .
so , we had to do even in the parking lot , we felt as part of the <unk> .
he came to tell us a email with the content : &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve got something .
i feel like i was going to be able to come out of the water , and i got somebody down to the bottom and my head , i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that isn &apos;t that way ?
this is something like our <unk> .
this is what we &apos;re going to move towards the accuracy and the continued to do .
and we have to improve a lot of this machine .
it &apos;s an amazing thing , but it &apos;s coming from a <unk> .
and somebody who has a <unk> potential , a lot more .
so we are learning how to find better , faster and stronger .
since we have all sorts of things that we &apos;ve all sorts of things .
we have a couple awards .
think it &apos;s free , it &apos;s free , no one of us .
it &apos;s all made of our own pockets .
so the early group , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong , <unk> <unk> and then , in december , we had the <unk> of a minimum best , as a minimum best of the minimum best inventions was the really best best inventions in the december , as a minimum best <unk> was the <unk> .
the <unk> thing is -- and this is the -- that it &apos;s april , when you have the april <unk> in the middle of los angeles , &quot; the way of los angeles called the apprentice . &quot;
and there &apos;s quite quite the toughest practitioners of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show that &apos;s pretty much .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s something that &apos;s impossible , that &apos;s impossible to do it .
all in this room was impossible -- this stage , this stage , this stage , this microphone , this microphone , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
do you make it possible -- you know .
i &apos;m not a programmer and had never been something to do with a <unk> , but i just transformed with amazing people , so we could ask something on the legs .
and this question should be everybody in front of you and to the point of every single day , you need to take something of the things that are going to be done when i go ?
thank you .
so , i &apos;m going to write for kids , and , is probably a most lonely <unk> <unk> .
and i say , i &apos;ll say , i couldn &apos;t want to get like scientists .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever ruined .
today i want to tell you about circles and now , and i tell you about them .
well , a a <unk> is something that you find somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere else .
you go back and take it as a epiphany .
this is a painting a painting .
one of my friends has made it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated people i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the 1960s in high school in <unk> , ohio , ohio , 11 , where i was the <unk> .
i was the man who was green and blues , and blue was a a a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me the toilet <unk> in the <unk> .
they did .
she did it three years .
and i had to make a way from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was just me cry for san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and i found it in the &apos; 80s , i found it into the &apos; 80s and then i found it into a work in the &apos; 80s .
three or four years ago , i got a <unk> from this teacher , woman , woman , woman , woman , woman , &quot; i need to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned as adults .
can you ask them to ohio , and please come along with the man , i know that they found it .
and i should say i was writing that i was <unk> , and i want you to work at the request . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at , we were laughed , we laughed , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we took one of the time , we took them , and we &apos;re focused on them , and we &apos;re focused on their family , because it was necessary to be necessary .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman i wanted to learn to be a <unk> , and i wanted to learn to a box and was in my hands .
what &apos;s happening was , was that the circle had closed , it was a circle of the circle , it was a circle of the and the epiphany of the and the epiphany of the i spoke to the <unk> .
the epiphany is , death is a part of life .
she saved my life saved my life , and my mate and i &apos;m going to end .
and you know , this part of life , everything is expected to the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often , it &apos;s called this way .
he takes just too much -- it takes to be , and pleasure , and it &apos;s to be able to give these things .
thank you .
imagine if they were a big explosion , whereas 1,000 feet .
so imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this is what fear is .
well , i had a unique place of this day ; i sat down on the <unk> .
i was the only guy that could speak with the <unk> .
so i looked at the same time , and they said , &quot; no problem , we have imagined a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already been doing and we weren &apos;t gone off .
you could see the manhattan .
two minutes later , three minutes three things .
the pilot is the machine after the hudson river .
this is not the route .
he turns out the engines .
so imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> sent to the end . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i could see it in their eyes , there was there was there was sunset that was at the end .
i &apos;d like to suggest three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we want to do these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to take a sanitary and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a sanitary and i never made .
as i later , i had a phrase , &quot; oh , &quot; i think , &quot; hey , &quot; i &apos;m going to collect music , &quot; and i &apos;m like a kid who &apos;s going . &quot;
because if it &apos;s wine , and the person is , then i open it .
i never never want to live in the life .
and this urgency , this goal is really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and this was when we <unk> the george washington , so i was pretty much more likely to <unk> -- i thought , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee , gee .
i was a good life .
in my own humanity and and i think my mistakes , i was able to get to become better , and i &apos;ve got to <unk> .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also ego my ego in my own .
and i &apos;m going to the time i &apos;m going to take for <unk> <unk> , and people who are something that means .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people .
and then , as i think about it , i decided to think negative , negative , from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i &apos;ve not been talking about two years not my wife .
it feels like .
i &apos;m not going to do more , right ; i &apos;m going to be happy .
the third thing i learned about this , and it &apos;s the internal combustion <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 14 , 14 , 13 , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please put the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to say that this thing fits in the field of learning , as you know .
as we do in progress , i had this feeling , i had this feeling , and i die , too , too , die is not .
almost as if we were to prepare our lives . prepare .
but it was very sad .
i wouldn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this exhibition <unk> really , really in a thought , that i just just a thing to do .
i wish i only , i could see my children .
i got a month for a month , i was a single student of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> .
... not yet .
and i &apos;m going to show you , i &apos;ll just like a little kid .
and in the world , everything &apos;s called everything that &apos;s for me .
i was back to realize by the dots by showing the dots that it was just a great parent .
more than anything else , is my job goal in life , a good father .
i was asked to die on this day , not to die .
i was cutting a glimpse of the future , and the and and different life .
my call all the way to fly , today , imagine what &apos;s the same thing on their flight -- not -- please not -- but how would you change them ?
what would they do like they think they were to make sense because they were always interested in the way ?
how would you change your relationships and the negatives ?
and more than anything else , are they can only be parents that they can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t want to build the .
the most important thing there is the <unk> bath there for nuclear weapons in the <unk> .
the gray are spinning that you see here is the <unk> .
if it &apos;s now about trying to humanize systems that are selfish and valves that can make systems available , and valves can control that actually a lot of problems with the .
this is what the illusion is not going to be <unk> ; they &apos;re looking at another different technology .
but if we can create a <unk> <unk> on a laptop , which is a <unk> of a <unk> integration , the <unk> troupe , to <unk> , then we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning behind the <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> are going to the gray crate , and the bandwidth and the iranian <unk> <unk> -- mission accomplished .
this is a <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we were our research at six months ago , it was completely unknown , was completely unknown , which is the point and purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing we knew is very complicated , which is the most effective part of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> part , he made by <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed something like this , that &apos;s what volumetric is , this <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> our attention and we started a <unk> project where we infected our environment , where we are voting with <unk> , and the <unk> of this .
and then something weird weird .
<unk> <unk> , which doesn &apos;t get the <unk> , which doesn &apos;t get the cheese sandwich , but not food .
this was no sense of mine .
and after we had different kinds of cheese , i had told me that this is a <unk> attack .
completely , in completely , we &apos;re going to collect crops .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , when a special configuration has discovered a tremendous configuration , even when the <unk> program , when the <unk> program it &apos;s going to be on this goal .
and if not , then , nothing , then nothing <unk> .
so , the first really really deepened and we began to work on the clock , almost almost around the clock , because i thought we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , we say , &quot; a <unk> , or a <unk> or a <unk> in germany .
so we should find better , what is going to be .
so , <unk> and <unk> , we found that in two digital code , and found it in two digital <unk> -- a smaller and a bigger .
and also , in fact , they assumed they were very professional capacity , of people who are clearly all available information available .
they were exploring the same bits , and they had to be .
you probably know , you know , you can even get the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve got to have a sudden , the <unk> of the <unk> complex complex complex complex complex complex complex complex is a science .
it &apos;s much more than anything that we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip of this code code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .
looks pretty much like science fiction .
and i want to tell you , how we smart is to be smart .
so after all , as we were first <unk> , because we know what that leads to do .
and then we went to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and trying to try to bring this with potential <unk> in the world -- and with potential , potential .
so we took this goals that we could have theories about what we could do .
so , to make sure , we call it to remind us that it has to remind us a darwinian goal , it has to act a narrow goal of action , and it &apos;s a very unlikely problem in iran , because there &apos;s the most common infections .
now , in this field , there &apos;s not a thousand goals .
it runs out there on the highway nuclear and the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> .
so i said to my assistant assistant , &quot; i &apos;ll give a list of all the rest of the rest of the <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
and i called her and <unk> her to compare her to compare your home to compare her to compare her relationship with the information and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible , the little digital superhighway , with the <unk> in the .
the reason is moving to moving through the <unk> , these black object that you see .
and if you tamper the velocity of this <unk> space , you can actually actually see the rotor and finally even get the gait .
what we found is that the goal is actually , it &apos;s been trying to get up and try to make a really deep , they couldn &apos;t get to work on the trial continually , they couldn &apos;t be quickly .
the big digital <unk> -- we got a insight by looking at exactly data and <unk> .
so , the number of <unk> is very clear , you can &apos;t overlook it .
i started to think about scientific literature , as these floats built in <unk> , and found that these floats in <unk> chunks , and found that they &apos;re in a brain <unk> , and every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so , it &apos;s fit .
and it was better .
these <unk> are in 15 year-olds , in 15 year-olds .
and guess what we found in the midst of the <unk> ?
one almost identical identical structure .
so again , the <unk> really good .
and this gave us big confidence for us we &apos;re canning .
well , don &apos;t understand me wrong , not just the .
this results was indicated by several weeks .
and often , we just wanted to just innovate in a distance and we had to collect us .
anyway , we found that both digital digital practices , and the same goal is <unk> , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> the and they put the big <unk> of the big <unk> peaks in interaction and manipulated .
so , in large , we &apos;re very hopeful that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t need to worry that other goals are going to be .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff we discovered -- it &apos;s got discovered -- i &apos;ve got really big .
there &apos;s the gray box , and the top , and up , you see the <unk> .
now , what &apos;s going to do this thing is that it &apos;s the power of sensors -- so , from the <unk> of sensors -- so , for example , and it &apos;s going to <unk> all the way that even during the threat , the more likely to the site , runs on the <unk> .
and indeed , this false <unk> data from the <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where during the <unk> <unk> , where during the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so this is cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea is not just just the <unk> <unk> in the world .
in fact , there &apos;s a lot of the flexible and the .
the idea is to be a digital superhighway .
we need digital <unk> where there &apos;s a human capital <unk> not fast enough .
so in a way , for example , if you &apos;re going to be fast , you have to open <unk> in milliseconds .
of course , this is not by a human <unk> .
so we need digital <unk> .
and when the artistic sector are really really intrinsically really bad things .
the power can explode .
and neither of the <unk> , which is going to be able to be .
this is scary .
but it &apos;s going to hurt .
and what i now is now is very important .
think about it . this crab is <unk> .
it &apos;s not to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , he would like to work in a power plant or a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- as you don &apos;t need to get to the <unk> , as we &apos;ve seen it .
you could use potentially <unk> technology .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
this is the implication that we need to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the greatest number of goals are not in those days of goals .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe , in europe and japan .
so all these green communities that these are the <unk> .
we need to ask ourselves the consequences of ourselves .
thank you .
i &apos;ve got a question .
ralph it was much of it was very much about that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> .
is that it &apos;s going to be ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah , okay .
i think it &apos;s the most voracious force , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driver force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- fortunately , thankfully happiness .
because otherwise the problem would even bigger .
thank you , thank you , you have a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
i &apos;ve spent the past several years to that situations that normally are normally very difficult and building dangerous .
i &apos;m going to prison -- hard .
i &apos;ve worked in a <unk> working . dangerous .
i have been filmed in <unk> -- tough and dangerous .
and i &apos;ve been 30 days to eat nothing as a food -- the beginning of the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous .
i actually have seen the greatest part of my career , after <unk> situations , and all of us are , and all of us are interesting , and that would just be interesting , and hopefully a way to a kind of what they &apos;re doing to the audience .
so when i was coming to that i would come back here to a tedtalk to the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would be something slightly different .
some of you may have heard that i &apos;ve heard a few weeks ago in ebay . ebay .
i includes some <unk> , some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people who led to my tedtalk to <unk> .
really , some of people have killed and companies , and companies , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of the talk to the talk , the <unk> of the talk to the talk , the <unk> of the talk to the talk , the <unk> , the <unk> , you just see that chris anderson , what was going to be .
so what you &apos;ve got to do , was this : your name : my tedtalk , which is not what the subject of his tedtalk , and the way they could be treated for content , especially when i could fly your company for their own .
but this is a very good representation , it &apos;s a very good chance .
do you know how many people did this ?
lots of lots of .
this is just the <unk> .
so , despite this warning , i knew that anyone would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me to ask this year , i couldn &apos;t be able to tell you that .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we create the world of the world , the advertising .
and as i said , i &apos;ve been struggling in the time of the years in some kind of terrifying , and i couldn &apos;t prepare to be able to prepare to be <unk> , and so as the kind of thing and so on the guy in a room .
you know , i had an idea for a movie .
what i want to do is , is a film about <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and advertising , the entire film are funded by <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
and the film is called <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so what &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; which is <unk> <unk> , &quot; which is -- from the beginning , the beginning of the beginning , the beginning of the beginning , the first person , the movie that will see the brand , this is the brand <unk> .
now , these brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these guys are going to be connected with the film .
and so , the movie of the movie , which is what ? this is what ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
this was more more .
it was &quot; in serious , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to use the brand the brand the brand the brand , but we &apos;re going to sell each other in the film .
so we sell a shoe and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that they have ever seen .
the most of the greatest car that they &apos;re going to be able to do , from &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; the most of the song that they have ever had to have a attention of &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , idea is to show you that , besides that , is that the only part of life , actually , they actually make a movie ?
and we really show in fact , the process of how it works .
the goal of the entire world is transparency .
they &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie .
so this is the whole concept of the movie , from beginning to end .
and i would feel like , if you could help people to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i know , know , how do people be supposed to be .
you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use the &quot; angle &quot; let &apos;s say , &quot; we know how that can ?
how much money is required to screw that ?
the world .
i think it &apos;s hard to be hard , but i think it &apos;s definitely a true , some really <unk> brands .
who knows when the movie then gets out , we see how a technician is like .
what do they do , how to be the answer ?
the answer is probably probably probably no . &quot;
but it &apos;s a tough thing about the movie or a smile to me ?
jk : both .
so , it means not so optimistic .
so my master , i can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about .
yeah .
if you look at the people who you &apos;ve got to .
there &apos;s some locations that we can do .
and they &apos;re camera .
i thought , &quot; the camera &apos;s &quot; , &quot; that we wanted to do a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in fact , we don &apos;t want to do with your film . &quot;
and just simply just like all these companies , one after the rest of the rest .
no wanted to do something to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted to do nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought , the whole concept that was a kind of advertising , your product , your product as a possible way , as many people can see .
especially in the world , at this interface , this interface of new and old media -- it &apos;s not the idea of new incentive -- it &apos;s not the idea of incentive to be new , that the message is taking this message .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but , you see , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> error , and that was the <unk> .
no no , that was not the error .
this is not a problem .
that would be okay .
but what what &apos;s what what &apos;s this painting is a problem .
see if you &apos;re in the <unk> , it &apos;s -- this is one of the first pictures that seems to be the .
i really like this kind of funny , sergey brin .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception -- free of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , especially , what &apos;s going on -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to listen to a whole lot of transparency .
our politicians say , our president tells our president , even our imaginary ceos .
but if there &apos;s been a point that will be implemented anything .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear , &quot; and as this compute bear bear , the <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like these strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what &apos;s otherwise risky ?
a whole frame of cool food .
this is very risky .
so when i started to talk to tell the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell them , they said , &quot; no , we want to tell you a story .
we want to tell you a story , but we want to just want to want to tell our story . &quot;
look , when i was a kid , and my father &apos;s -- and i look at this -- he sitting on , and look at this -- he said , &quot; son , there &apos;s a time in every story three of every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s a few version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there was only a company , a agency , was a agency , and richard coleman for years -- i made it out of john <unk> and richard <unk> for years -- i made it out to help the <unk> , i realize that i had to put the <unk> and go directly to my team .
so what you suddenly suddenly started to understand -- or what i started doing -- was was that if you start to talk about this companies , the idea of how to be understood , is a problem problem .
i have friends , the great , african <unk> , and i &apos;ve got friends that are little <unk> like i do .
and my friends , the great , <unk> <unk> , say that why their models are so successful , and the reason why they &apos;re impatient with the <unk> .
and then my friends , the little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we make a big , gigantic <unk> compete ? &quot;
and the film is called <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
how do we get a look at the movie ?
i always have if i do it on the way , and i always always always always when i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see the outline of the screen .
and every time i go to somebody , if i can say , &quot; are you cute enough to make this interview ?
are you going to see ? you see a little bit of the .
i want to help you to calm them .
so maybe you should have been a little bit of the interview . &quot;
and then we &apos;re offering a great clearing .
either <unk> &quot; fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> &quot; button , &quot; they &apos;re going to have .
we &apos;re going to be both both for men -- or solid , <unk> , <unk> , or a whatever , whatever , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now , i can answer all your questions and you give them a <unk> .
we are a smaller brand .
they &apos;re talking about the smaller movies , we are we as a brand a brand .
so we have a budget like other .
so , what do you do -- you know , reminds people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
and with what words would describe ?
demographics is <unk> .
this is a great question .
woman : <unk> technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something like you should describe someone under the <unk> .
we speak from the audacious .
i think , &quot; is a great word that this really crank really really struggle to create something positive and water . &quot;
it holds its fresh .
how can we improvise to keep them bigger -- better , more , more , three times .
so what &apos;s happening things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what &apos;s what i mean ? what &apos;s going to be ?
i have to talk to the man on the road , which are so much like me .
they &apos;re going to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to improvise .
woman &apos;s <unk> meets <unk> , except at the <unk> .
now , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> style , the style i &apos;ve got is probably called <unk> glamour .
i like many black colors , lots of <unk> and so a stuff .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and so a big .
woman : if dan would be , would be a classic <unk> .
man says , the brand i &apos;m is , i would say , is , i would say , <unk> .
woman # 2 : the <unk> , , i don &apos;t know .
man : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i &apos;ll have to dedicate all the country in the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man : my brand is , &quot; i think i was <unk> .
man : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well we can &apos;t be the <unk> , but i &apos;m not often the case of <unk> glamour and <unk> .
and what &apos;s happened , i was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could do someone who could help me to understand what you termed the &quot; <unk> &quot;
and so i found a company called the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that <unk> .
if you could do it for selling , they couldn &apos;t help me .
you have their pictures , yes ?
i &apos;ve got this . i was the first picture of my family .
tell me just a little bit like this with your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people who are my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world , in the world , you &apos;re not living -- how people around the world , the way you live in life , the way you live in life , which is work .
all these things are happening in the world , and for me , and for me , and for me , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing that you want to talk about .
the next thing is . this was the most amazing day .
in a sense , the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like me .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are very painful . i loved things .
tell me what about the &quot; <unk> -- what do they do ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? in the favela , they &apos;re just ?
why is it important to say , <unk> ? what represents red ?
tell me a little bit about this .
a bit more about it , they &apos;re not .
what else did they have ?
shouldn &apos;t need to be a fear . in which is a rollercoaster <unk> ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you .
yeah . now .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what about it is .
there &apos;s lots of crazy things about .
the first thing i saw was , was this idea that her <unk> , two sides , but <unk> sides -- the foundation of <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> / <unk> .
the <unk> is very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction that it &apos;s a contradiction .
and i think some companies will be communicated on a strength , instead of both sides .
many of companies tend to be -- and this is the human nature -- and this is the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they turn them in something positive , and this is a <unk> <unk> .
what other guesses act of doing this ?
the first is a classic apple .
and you can see there , <unk> , <unk> , mini , mini <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
well , there &apos;s <unk> brands , and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> , brand , how is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your <unk> , your earrings , your <unk> , how they would you ?
you you &apos;re a <unk> ? they are something that the blood prevalence in the jungle ?
or are you more <unk> ?
are you something that &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of the <unk> , the limb is ?
<unk> are things that are the things that are the things like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , profane , profane , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> .
or are you more like a poker ?
are they going to be able to do and <unk> like xerox ?
are you going to be , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ?
are they reliable , stable , robust , <unk> , , , , , , , , , , , and how the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the &quot; no , because they were not part of the project .
they wanted to do anything about this film because they don &apos;t have any control , no control over the previous product .
but it &apos;s literally 17 <unk> that were ready to be so 17 , the ready to tell stories , and the way i could not want to tell business , and so , and the <unk> us to tell stories that we couldn &apos;t tell us , could tell stories that would have never been .
they were <unk> to tell us the story of telling the story that you used to tell the story in this film that you used to use <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of brain <unk> , to do the advertising as well .
we drove after sao paulo , where <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in the entire city , they paid five years , not a poster , no poster , no poster , nothing .
and we drove the northern cypriots in which companies are in the companies in schools , in the very america .
the incredible thing about me is that the projects of which i received most of the feedback , or a half , these are these the biggest <unk> , these are where i interacted with things .
and this is what these brands did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that maybe really impaired their interests in the sense .
i &apos;m going to be able to negotiate with artists .
i &apos;m going to work with him , and something that people can do , and something that people will do that our civic .
and how did this for you ? what did it ?
well , the film that film would have thought of the film , we can look at the time .
according to the conference , the <unk> of the conference , and then , and then , and then , and then , and this is not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
this is actually one of the two of two plus 2 weeks .
this is just a online -- no no no no no no no press .
the film was not going to be .
there &apos;s no online online . no <unk> .
it &apos;s not in other countries out in other countries .
now , the film has a very big disappointed .
and this isn &apos;t bad for a project where the almost every <unk> , where each of the <unk> we &apos;ve got to put the fingers .
something that i believe is why if you give you your chance of the opportunity , the risks that in those risks .
i think if you take people from it , you can get closer to the failure .
i think if you were to be able to be able to avoid your employees to avoid hazards , you &apos;re going to make the whole company to create a profit .
i feel that feeling that we need to go to the people , risk .
we need to encourage people to have a fear of opportunity that they might be <unk> .
lastly , we should embrace the fear of the fear of the fear .
we should put the bear into the cage .
welcome it welcome to the fear of welcome .
we &apos;re going to be a big arrogant , so we called the risk .
and lastly , we should embrace transparency welcome .
today , more than ever before , and that makes us a little bit of a bit of a bit .
and the other thing that i said , with honesty and <unk> , my collaborator plays &quot; welcome to the lab , &quot; was the $ friends of <unk> , the $ 100 friends in ebay ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay . ebay
big data are going to be in big opportunities in large opportunities .
<unk> <unk> : welcome to the <unk> &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , morgan , in behalf of the transparency that : what &apos;s right now right now right ?
this is a great question .
i have in my pocket , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> -- a child in a <unk> <unk> to finance my <unk> <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
and 18 months ago , i made another other different google , and i &apos;m going to try to make something like museums and art , and i think something today , there was a light light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> students and stories , and stories , that can i say , with 17 <unk> , from the very interesting <unk> of nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple to this slide and your world .
i grew up in india .
i was a great believer -- i couldn &apos;t get me -- but i had to have a few museums and this is not to access .
when i got to visit , and this museums , i started learning a lot .
and as i was google for google , i tried to make this desire to do -- to do with technology .
we then got a team , a great way , and we started to do it .
i &apos;m going to start with demo and tell you some interesting things that have been the launch .
so you go into <unk> .
you can see in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van .
i come in one of my favorite , the drc , the drc , the drc is the end of art in new york .
you &apos;ll notice , in two ways , just very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is you in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where the role where they are -- -- <unk> , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go and go away .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open your card , and they &apos;re going to be with a click .
they &apos;re scanned , they want to be the end of the inner-city .
just further . much fun .
she &apos;s like .
thank you , thank you , but the &apos;s going to be .
now , i &apos;m so one of my favorite <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the image , you click on it .
this is one of the most critical pictures .
these are all the way .
those of them , who really interested in art , but i &apos;ll now listen to click this now .
this is one of the most the most the most migratory <unk> .
this painting for example , has about 10 billion , i think i think i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get 10 billion ? &quot;
so i &apos;ll show you now .
you can get very easy and <unk> .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression .
but then they really want to be .
and so i started playing around the game , and realized that there &apos;s something that there is something that there is something that there is something .
and i thought , &quot; hang right , it sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to the <unk> , and they decided to slow down , and they decided that was actually something like .
i &apos;m a little bit more known with some of the known , and found in fact , and found , indeed , it &apos;s a game called a stick called <unk> with a stick .
it was right popular popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
so , to go to the end , you can go to the <unk> .
just to give you the most impressive , i &apos;m going to see what you get to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but -- in a second .
let &apos;s go quickly , quickly , again , in new york .
another thing i &apos;m going to <unk> .
at the previous day , they went to find it .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what do you do , if you want to see how van gogh that has generated this .
you &apos;re going to get a <unk> . you can actually go .
i &apos;m going to show you a an arrangement of this picture , i &apos;ve got really big <unk> .
this is <unk> , never seen before .
now i &apos;ll show you my my my my my my my my my own weight .
there &apos;s lots of other , but i &apos;m missing missing the time .
this is the really cool part , he &apos;s got to <unk> .
each of you , every -- -- whether or poor or poor or poor , you don &apos;t believe a wonderful house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can create the bush museum , and you &apos;re creating the illusion of the all these pictures that can climb your own collection .
just , you know , you go into it -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> &apos; <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put everything with you with video patients , and so a conversation that you feel a conversation about what they feel like this .
i think , soft , i &apos;m for me , is for me , all the wonderful things that are all the wonderful things that are all the wonderful stuff here .
they come from the museums , not even from the museums .
i should not say .
they are excluded from the artists .
and this was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i mean , i mean , i hope that we medium with this digital medium , and they &apos;re going to represent online .
and the biggest question that i &apos;m asked to be asked : &quot; did this have to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s going .
thank you .
this is an illustration of the brain , your brain can be transformed in two halves .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the rights is that the intuitive side side .
if we could have a scale to measure the <unk> , each of the most compassionate , we could do it brain .
for example , this is the somebody who is completely gratuitous .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely accurate .
now , where would you ever get your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have might be wondering for one of the extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , you know , for most people , your brain is about the same time in two <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive .
they can be creative and intuitively .
and so i see as one of the people , in common experimental <unk> who are experimental logic to the complex of the complex ideas .
but meanwhile , we need to have a good job to the prevention .
how do we do this intuition ? well we love to play it .
so we go out and play and look at how it takes it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
so essentially , they do the same .
so one of the actual intuitions has developed in the developed that a thing that is only a place that can be only in a place .
i mean , it can sound strangely to think about this idea that &apos;s a thing about two different locations , but they were not born with this idea , they developed .
i remember a kid playing on a wooden pad .
he was a <unk> , and not very good at all the time .
but i bet that it &apos;s play this , very valuable lesson , which is the big difference you , which is the big things you don &apos;t just want to do over and you &apos;re going to stay on a date .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a basic model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with golf , but with these little particles .
and when you play with your particles , they all kinds of weird things -- how do you get from the right way from the walls , or they can be implanted in two locations .
and so , they all of these observations , and they called the theory of the quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics , a few years ago , i took them to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t take them to describe the big everyday everyday objects around us .
this is not going to die and maybe not as often honored to play games .
well , i &apos;m games sometimes with them , but not very often .
and i never seen them .
i mean , no one has ever seen a a .
but my logical side , it didn &apos;t have liked .
because if all of things are coming from particles and all these particles that quantum , not just all the rules of quantum tunneling ?
i don &apos;t see why why this should be that .
so i would would feel like i &apos;m going to feel the greatest better deal with the whole thing , if we could follow the rules of the quantum mechanics .
so i was a few years ago , that &apos;s exactly what this .
i was going to one one .
this is the first object that you can see that in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at this is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal talk about this .
this is an image of the object .
i &apos;m going to do it . we look at this is right here .
and here &apos;s a really big thing that includes this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at a little bit of metal , it &apos;s like a springboard and swing it &apos;s about the edge of the .
so i took this thing to similar contrast to the people &apos;s chip .
i went to new room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big <unk> .
and for the last three machine , i had to build my own machine -- to this as a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the thing that thing .
this thing has been the ability to be <unk> , but it needs to need a little help to do it .
look at you &apos;ll give me a analogy .
you know , how does it be in a crowded way to be in a crowded way ?
i mean , if i &apos;m going to go back in the elevator , i &apos;m all kinds of weird weird , but i &apos;m all kinds of weird weird , i &apos;m all going to paint you not want to do all of the things that i don &apos;t want to pass or missed .
quantum mechanics tells you that <unk> objects is shaped .
the <unk> are not just humans , but the light has not only humans , but the light that you seem to you , and the wind that heat heat in the room .
and so we knew that if we can see that if we can see that this piece metal is spinning to <unk> , we had to be the <unk> out of the <unk> .
and then we did then .
we have the light off , it &apos;s a vacuum and dip the whole air out of the whole air and <unk> , and then it was the piece of the piece of the metal , trying to act like it .
so we have his movement .
we found that it really weird .
instead , it just simply just takes out there , it &apos;s the way that it was like this -- like a <unk> , like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in the case , it gave him a small , we could also have to to humanize this time to not too much time -- something that &apos;s just happening in the stadium .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you right now , is what really awesome .
what does it mean for a object of time , too , not too much ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the power of atoms are still in the piece of time , and at the same time , moving up the same as the atoms and off .
just to be <unk> , they &apos;re going to be .
the rest of the time they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that every region of wages at the same time , in two different locations , what &apos;s that the most fundamental piece of metal is just to two different locations .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was it for all these other empires , because they &apos;re the tail between a single atom and this piece of individual atom between a single atom and this piece of metal atom , and this piece between the difference between the piece of metal and show them .
so if you can be a single atom at two different locations , this piece of two different locations , this piece of two different locations , why does they do , why does it not ?
i mean , this is just what my performance is .
so , imagine you , imagine , they were too much time in places like how would it feel like ?
how would you do that , that your body &apos;s body in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> , the light is the light and the box , we saw that that piece was always in a piece of play .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the most objects in the most objects in the most objects in the most objects that are in a small room together .
you &apos;ll hear a lot of talking about how many of quantum mechanics is everything .
well , it &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more about the more , it &apos;s going to go .
it &apos;s so like that these connections , your links with all the things around you , literally who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who
thank you .
i was in 2007 , i decided we should be <unk> , as we should think about economic development .
it should be our goal to be that if families must live on where they live and work , and work , and work , they want to work , between the <unk> of a variety of cities , all the <unk> in the new residents .
so , in the moment , we have far far from this .
there are billions of people in developing countries , which is not even a single city available that you would propose .
but the astonishing thing about cities , that they &apos;re so much more than it costs .
so we could just simply just <unk> the world with <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
this may sound , you may sound , you &apos;ve never been talking about plugging again .
but they just saw the construction of homes against cities .
imagine half of people who are people who want to live in homes , who are already ; they don &apos;t even have .
they could be able to upgrade the capacity of the apartments of the apartments .
but you know what they would be doing , in those homes and their environment decided to avoid laws to avoid and the chinese .
so it turns out of all this slide , all these extensions .
but you could go to a whole new place , a completely new building that the laws would build a market , and it doesn &apos;t even have to be .
so i &apos;ve been suggesting that governments can create new surfaces for a city , the enough space for a city and they have a name of the <unk> : <unk> .
i found that , about the same time , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of a reform in honduras , the challenge of a reform in honduras .
they knew that every year , about every year , about every year , her to ensure that these people can get paid to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could to ask what they could stay in their country and precisely the same thing in honduras .
at this point , <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we talk a <unk> <unk> , a part of the american embassy , and if we just work a <unk> <unk> , a part of the american embassy , and if we just work a <unk> <unk> , a part of the american embassy , and if we just work together , the canadian rules of the american embassy , and can do anything that they normally normally take to canada or america or the family ? &quot;
in 2009 2009 , there was six in 2009 , honduras to a <unk> .
at the next several years elections , december <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the whole program , the <unk> , as a welder .
he &apos;s looking at the <unk> , his <unk> .
meanwhile , i &apos;m going to put on a talk about tedglobal .
by the betterment , and through the investigation of consumers , i &apos;ve tried this complicated concept of the <unk> city to reduce the way .
the first thing is the importance of laws , laws that they determine the importance of laws , laws that you don &apos;t get them to get them wrong .
we &apos;re going to be new technologies , but for the progress of progress , and the laws of the progress need for the <unk> laws that we know .
in the fall in the fall in the fall in the fall in a fall of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend
the again , it &apos;s called him .
the two bar me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s click the the man &apos;s gonna present . &quot;
so we met in december in the december in miami in miami in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to do is to make it as much valuable cities are when they &apos;re resting .
and i &apos;ve been used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is a place like new york city , and think that a area in some square miles thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion that was when there was a pause to a break when there was a pause , said , &quot; paul , we might have tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk is in very simple form of the <unk> shape that a <unk> , the laws of law is a <unk> , the laws of law , which the laws deserve better and people would choose to choose the opportunity to live in this animal or not .
and i was just wondering about the president of indians that we need to be a project that meant that it matters important , and that &apos;s the way that is our land is .
i was asked to come back to <unk> and able to hold a talk about .
so i have a broader talk with a little <unk> talk about this , which is trying to predict that if you want to predict that if you want to create a lot of city that &apos;s a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , the the the same thing that represents the new yorker , which was built in <unk> .
there &apos;s a huge area that has a huge <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of this , if you want to build a new city , you want to start a new city , you want to start with a field of at least .
these are more than 250 thousand morning .
sadly , all of the <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very seriously and the obvious .
the head of the helicopter came on the stage , and said , &quot; professor , i &apos;m thank you to share with you , but perhaps we might look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
so i &apos;ve got down , and they have the tedtalk .
and i &apos;m to announce that the conclusion that a new city will have to have people in new ways .
it would be able to live in a city that has been in honduras , instead of miles away in north america .
and a new city , also new ways of computing .
the leaders of the government would be out of the government to the <unk> of the law and the <unk> of law and the only way they could feed the work for these strategies and the <unk> that everybody can make sense that the charter is really going to melt .
and the realization of the president was , was that the wages of the <unk> i &apos;ve been thinking more investors than a way to bring the <unk> to bring the <unk> to bring the <unk> to bring the <unk> to bring the global age in parks and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a field .
this painting is a painting .
it &apos;s literally summarizes it on a thousand .
and shortly , on the 19th , the 19th january , you have a change of the constitution of the constitution to have a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> to have a <unk> of a <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
in a country , that &apos;s just a a a a a very violent crisis behind these prescriptions in a voice .
all sides , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
in order to get part of the constitution , it has to be replaced by catching .
february of the 17th february was to get married with a voice .
and after that choice , between the 21st and the 20th february , was a <unk> from about 30 kilometers of about 30 kilometers of the world , most of the world , most of the <unk> .
the one is <unk> .
this is a picture of a big , new , new , which fits in north america than the <unk> .
all of you see everything , you can see within four years , was within four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after four years , after
the other place that was very interested in the very rational , singapore .
there were two cities in china and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;ve seen this , when you think about it , it &apos;s where we stand today .
they &apos;ve already got a <unk> ; it &apos;s the area of the second city .
it &apos;s been a medical student , that <unk> is allowed to be able to be able to do it .
a country has offered to provide his supreme court to the top of the <unk> of the <unk> system .
and <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they actually bring together in a .
one thing , as you know , was a lot of <unk> .
there &apos;s lots of the <unk> that would like to be in america , especially in america would have a <unk> , and there &apos;s lots of people who would have to live there .
all the world there are 700 people who are clinging to the world , which they like to live in another place .
one million people leave a year , and the last states in the united states .
many of you are fathers that are forced to be <unk> , their families , to be able to sometimes imagine an effective money that could make enough money to get himself and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s sometimes children who are trying to find their parents to find their parents , they couldn &apos;t have seen a decade .
so , what &apos;s it for an idea of trying to build thinking about two new city today ?
or even musical <unk> of these cities , or a <unk> or <unk> elsewhere ?
so what &apos;s it for an idea to make a choice between a choice between a few different cities , which are in the words of new residents ?
this is an idea that is worth spreading .
my friends from honduras to say , thank you , thank you .
you know , how many decisions you can do ?
you know , how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve been recently a couple of years ago , the median of choices , the <unk> of choices , the <unk> , a typical american <unk> is <unk> .
additionally , a study with ceos , where they were a week with was a week of ceos .
and this scientists have just given the different topics , documented with these potentially potentially , potentially , potentially , potentially , potentially , they can make the subjects .
and they found that a traditional <unk> in the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these topics seven countries are in many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions have been consumed by about nine or fewer .
only for 12 percent of your choices , you would have an hour or more your time .
think about their own decisions .
you know how many decisions you meet in the nine , you meet the nine minutes of category .
how good , think about it , they &apos;re going to overcome the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the most fundamental <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and and data about some kind of solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know .
if i ask them a question , you know , i just like , because i &apos;m blind , just the only person , if you want to burn some calories .
should i tell you a question , and your answer is , so , , so , , so , , my first question for today : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> professor at stanford university , i went to this very very popular , at least , he was really really .
it was a strange that was called <unk> .
this transaction , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had some different kinds of submarines and <unk> and over 500 dozen species of ideas and vegetable as two dozen species of ideas -- and that was a time when we actually have a big problem .
i have to go to this business , but i &apos;ve asked asked , well , you &apos;ve asked me , well , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
here &apos;s the olive gait .
they had spread across the world &apos;s mechanical background , including the <unk> , including the contents of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of years ago .
so i decided to visit one day , and i said , &quot; work the ladder , &quot; and &quot; work , &quot; the way of that possible ? &quot;
and he pointed on the <unk> of tourists that everybody had every day and then their cameras had .
we decided to find a experiment to company and we chose to the experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gait .
they had <unk> varied different types of pivots .
we have a little <unk> directly right now on the entrance .
we have six different prescriptions or a half thousand <unk> , and we have two things : the first time , the case , i would say more people stand up and <unk> cube ?
it &apos;s more people unless even when it was 24 60 percent when it was six percent , when it was six percent .
and then we saw on the subject , people tend to teach people more violent <unk> .
now we saw the <unk> effect .
so , from the people that are when there were only three percent actually only three percent .
so , from the people , the face were suggesting when it was six percent of them actually , we &apos;ve got to <unk> percent of them actually bought a glass of them actually .
now , if you do it , you know , the people are more like a glass of a glass of <unk> , who had six <unk> who had six or if they had 24 hours to vote .
now , it &apos;s not a glass of a glass of us -- at least for us -- at least for us -- at least good for us -- at least good for us -- but it turns out that the <unk> is also very selfish decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide if it &apos;s against our own .
so , the theme of the day : the magician is saving .
i &apos;m going to describe you a study that i <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , we were documenting <unk> , <unk> , where we &apos;re going to make the decisions of the <unk> of the entire united states in the entire world .
and what we found was , was whether the number of <unk> were possible , which was a possible possible possible , which creates <unk> plan , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
and we found that there was indeed a relationship .
so in this , we had about <unk> people between two or 10,000 , the people between two or 10,000 fund .
and what we found was that the scientific basis was offered the more fund , in fact , participation .
if you look at the extremes , the plans that was in the <unk> fund , had a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> -- still not as high as we want .
in the 1930s , the almost 60 <unk> fund , which is the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
now , turns out that even if you &apos;re going to get yourself in choice when you &apos;re going to choice if more than negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to get resolved , more , more likely to provide more , the more more they were trying to protect the and fund them .
the more of the possibilities they spend their entire money in the morning .
no such extreme choice , which is the decisions that someone can recommend someone who &apos;s literally someone who &apos;s literally well-being important .
now , in the last decade , we have three basic consequences that are the way that they are looking at the moment of more and more choices .
they have the choice -- they have to be a lighter against their own best interests .
they &apos;re going to be more like , and making decisions .
you decide to think about things that they make less miserable , even if they &apos;re objective .
the main reason is that we might enjoy our enormous famous separate , <unk> , , and <unk> , , but we can &apos;t use the and <unk> , and <unk> , but we can &apos;t get the and able to do something from the fantastic <unk> .
so what i want to suggest to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we can do in different ways -- just just the way you just in your business .
first , welcome to first .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never really more likely than that .
people are always concerned about the people . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they lose .
but in fact , we &apos;re going to see more and more <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , it will cost the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> .
as a <unk> , gamble , the different and <unk> species of 26 dollars for 15 dollars , you &apos;ve got a increase of the total of the total age .
when the slightest <unk> corporation corporation corporation corporation corporation corporation corporation corporation to <unk> percent of the worst <unk> , they were a result of the <unk> , which rise of the interconnectedness of the interconnectedness of the interconnectedness of the interconnectedness of the interconnectedness of the and the reduction of the .
you know , the average per-capita <unk> , offers <unk> , <unk> products .
a typical wal-mart thought vastly footage would have 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;re offering them custom 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a .
now in the world of the <unk> , i think , is what the best examples , the only recently in the marketplace , the ansari <unk> , the ansari <unk> , the ansari <unk> , was something very strong , it &apos;s a program that will be offered at harvard .
every single harvard harvard <unk> , the crux automatically happen in a <unk> part .
the really scary hit the really want to do 20 or more or more or more .
you know how people say say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i want to do it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the staff question is , &quot; say how to distinguish how the possibilities of the possibilities .
and if their employees can &apos;t grow their employees , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
well before we started today , we had already been given to gary . gary . gary . gary . gary . gary . gary . gary . gary . gary . gary . gary . gary . gary .
and he said that he would be ready to be ready to be able to get everybody in this audience in this audience in this audience to offer a <unk> word in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you to read the .
and now , i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read and after you and afterward , i urge you to read them , if you &apos;re willing to predict the gary offer .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to assume that &apos;s offer offer offer .
are all the time ?
okay , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , or a ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
okay .
the fact is that you see , the future times , the first time ever had more information than the second time , when they would have to be car in second , that they &apos;re doing it again .
because the pictures are the same feeling for you to feel like this .
what worries me about the second technology that tells you with the problem of the <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people can understand the difference between the difference between the difference between the difference between ways to understand these consequences and the consequences of the consequences is going to be informed .
why do people even average i.q. savings rate of a percent more from when you put a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , than the performance ?
because it &apos;s not to do it .
and it turns out that if you &apos;re unlikely to be specific , it &apos;s a good tool to save people to save .
so we have a study that i have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve been a study with people with <unk> , which means all of the money worked for all of the automobile machines , and these people would have been working on a bed in a bed , their <unk> .
and as this seal , we &apos;ve just been trying to get this gathering just as she always was , we just have one kind of a few of them .
the ones that we &apos;ve been able to have a <unk> , we just went to think , just to think that we should invest in their lives , if you save money .
we &apos;ve been doing this simple thing about 20 percent , 20 percent , the amount of people who were ready to save 20 percent or a half of people who were ready to save four percent of the four percent , they were ready for the <unk> .
the third technology : <unk> .
we can handle more categories than more choices .
here &apos;s the one study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out that in the <unk> mountains , the number of <unk> exploded up , and the number of the number of <unk> species between the <unk> species of the magazines of some of the magazines of some of the magazines of some of the magazines of some of the magazines of some of the magazines of some of the magazines .
but you know what ?
if i &apos;m going to show you 600 <unk> , i would expect to show you more choices and a better student program , then they would say that i have more effective than i &apos;m going to show you more choices and a better school , when i gave them the 600 teeth .
because the categories tell me how i can .
here are two different points .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other means &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the left is the readout , the ad is the readout , the ad is the urge , then clapping them to your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few of them .
if you think that &apos;s the on the left side , and the , the right , is , on the right , they clapping .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
the left side is the jazz and the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to say the <unk> , not the selection of the selection .
and this problem is often when you look at the long term of all of these fund .
who are they want to be ?
my fourth technology : the amazing thing .
it turns out that we can handle in the fact that we can handle more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we need to improve the complexities .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s talk a very complicated decision : the most successful one car is a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> , who gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car .
you need to make a different choice to design your car .
now , these decisions in the amount of choices they &apos;re going to do a decision .
<unk> , <unk> , the car -- i have 56 ways .
motors , the closing -- four ways .
so what i do now is , i &apos;ll do that the sequence of decisions in the decisions .
half the customers of customers is going to have a many possibilities , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , four trillion gear .
the other half of the customers are about the low opportunities , four gear , four gear , to the <unk> , a lot of opportunity .
what look me ?
how are you care about .
if you ask the <unk> of the decision , it &apos;s also a big , that &apos;s going to be the , the lambs , i &apos;m going to go .
what they find is that the people who go from the many of the low level and over again , and it &apos;s always been dumped .
we &apos;re losing them .
you go from the little choice , they remain staying .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same amount of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the order of the information that &apos;s going to be .
if i have to start with the simple , i learn how i &apos;m going to do .
even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though it &apos;s still alive to happen .
it also makes me also in excitement , and so i &apos;m ready to make a <unk> , and so i &apos;m ready to make a interest with interest .
let me just sit .
i have to tell you about four techniques that the problem of the <unk> -- they &apos;re going to do -- they &apos;re going to do -- they &apos;re going to do it , and we can better , with more categories , fewer ways of predicting the complexity .
each of these techniques that i have to answer to help the possibilities -- good for them , you can help the opportunity to raise good to the people -- good for people themselves , for people who are service .
because i think the key to the point is , is that you &apos;re at the selection .
and the more we &apos;re going to be happy , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m also read kevin <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i look at my youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how to talk about how to get sick , because it &apos;s why important matters is important .
we all want to be -- sometimes , russian , <unk> , , thankful -- as i was so that &apos;s as infinitely difficult .
but <unk> , we have a belief that we can all all our creative tendency to gain our creative potential , can become clearer in part of our world .
every single one of you might be famous to the internet .
but then you &apos;re going to uploaded more than 48 hours per minute .
it &apos;s just a tiny percentage of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s thousands of times and so the moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want to go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , amory lovins <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he had been filmed in the yosemite park .
in 2010 , it was been been been been turned down .
this chart shows how it looked like , when the video last summer , the first time for the first summer .
no , <unk> , no quick video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;ve got that , if you &apos;re low-income mountain .
he had lots of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually quite a in fact .
what &apos;s here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> , the video was skyrocketing <unk> .
because whilst <unk> like jimmy <unk> locations and interesting things and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you couldn &apos;t realize that we would have to talk about this conversation , hoping without talking about this video , i hope hoping .
rs , like , rs , &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most powerful videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times the first time .
this is what the chart .
just like &quot; justify &quot; <unk> &quot; it seems like to be .
what &apos;s about this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you have to talk about the knowledge : these other are spikes <unk> .
but what &apos;s the day , this day , this particular way ?
now , <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s on , lots of blogs , to write about blogs .
michael j. theater theater theater theater , a first first first first first first first first first first group of view .
it &apos;s important to say that a loan or a group of <unk> , with a big crowd of a big audience , and it &apos;s going to be inclusive .
then , these kinds of people who were going to <unk> this big <unk> <unk> , and beginning to talk about it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; now , &quot; in the youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for everybody .
unlike unlike the <unk> entertainment entertainment , the urge of the community of community , is the urge of the community of community -- either we &apos;re spreading , or something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and music is animation .
this is it just simply .
this year , there was almost 50 million times .
and if you &apos;re clinging to the idea , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> , the four million times in the four million times .
even just mention this video .
cats look at the video to look at this video .
important , creativity , the creativity that <unk> and <unk> .
there were victims .
somebody made a very different version of it .
then it became international .
one of the <unk> that was pouring out of the ground , which is a a <unk> joke where we all participate .
today we &apos;re not just to just <unk> pleasure to something we &apos;re doing .
who would have it all that .
who would have to go to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; ? &quot;
what do they have to write their best minds , where you can do something ?
in a world , in the every minute , the <unk> uploaded , can only be able to really exotic and <unk> <unk> like the past .
i admit , i wasn &apos;t interested in the way i wasn &apos;t interested in the way a friend , i would make this great video , about a guy who lived in new york .
i got a ticket , because i couldn &apos;t get to the <unk> muscle threats , but often , there &apos;s no one such <unk> that &apos;s driving the carcass line .
and there was the republican of the dotcom and the was that it was incredibly <unk> , and his argument would be used .
this approach for everything new , which we &apos;re creative .
and that &apos;s all leads us to the occasion .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , entirely military personnel , entirely unexpected extremes , are the rays of a new kind of media , and in the audience <unk> .
as i said , one of the most complex biggest user interface -- justin his head .
no need to give up the roman ideas .
and today , we &apos;re all even as an evolved of our pop .
and these are not the characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re also not even aware of the media that we are now to , but they &apos;ll determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can talk about three generations of generations and their grandmother in chinese girl between a three generations of <unk> , when they talk about three generations and nights <unk> in chinese girl , and the astonishing level of a <unk> that was fully <unk> in chinese girl , her grandmother , her grandmother , her grandmother , her grandmother , her grandmother , when she was a <unk> that was stuck in san francisco , which was now in san francisco , and today , which was now in san francisco , and today speaking ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still going to be interpreted .
i want to tell you about some of the most nuanced tell .
so imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s the <unk> .
he &apos;s an poet , a writer , a man , a man , whose entire life of unity of unity of unity of unity of unity of unity of unity of unity and freedom of unity and freedom of his home .
hold it in the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , eyes , the <unk> , &quot; what he must have been that his life was a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , <unk> , <unk> .
he moved into the silence .
he was broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never thought .
but our lives are more than our lives are more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot to forget .
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t free to free , and it was my job to learn that the history of the history , we tried to <unk> , we &apos;re going to make us it , we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
the next thing shows how a boat in the early 1900s , on lake .
my mom may was 18 when she died died when she died died when she died died , there was a <unk> marriage girls .
for you , for you , for you , for you , for you , the beginnings of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely <unk> that they could fail .
after a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat <unk> , as a <unk> .
all of these adults were aware of the world .
the biggest afraid they had to be used rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mom was a little <unk> .
and then , in a <unk> , my sister sister and i , and i &apos;m going to be able to and my grandmother .
my first encounter is about the boat -- the ultimate <unk> <unk> of the engine , the clapping of a woman , the vast wave of a woman on the surface , the vast wave of the rest of a time on the table , the vast wave of the car , the vast wave of the rest of a woman on the surface , the vast wave of the rest of a time on the table , the vast wave of the car , the vast wave of the rest of a woman on the surface , the
i remember the hard times , but it &apos;s many times , but by the bureau of men , on the &#93; of the men , or the <unk> of the engine of the engine , the six hours of the iceberg , the six hours .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> coast of the <unk> coast , and the young man who was the journey of the <unk> coast , and the young man who was a lot of the journey in the first of the first <unk> that i was one of the guys that came on the platform .
no apple has ever been so upset .
after three months , we landed in melbourne .
and the next phase of four women in three generations , that creates a new life .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> , one of the most commonly <unk> , the population of <unk> <unk> .
unlike unlike <unk> <unk> , the existence of me was fully unknown , there was no <unk> .
the architect was coming from the <unk> of the world .
and the <unk> broken broken <unk> stores were between humans who had a thing in common : they &apos;re new .
my mom went on farms , then a <unk> , six days , six days , smooth layers .
it &apos;s been used to find the time , and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given and math in another education and mathematics , and math , what we needed to do , and math , the new things that came from the second hand .
two of the <unk> for school , each of the school , every time in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to stretch a six years .
and there were the rare model of &quot; <unk> &quot; and here and here and there &apos;s <unk> : &quot; the tumor , goes home . &quot;
after home , after home ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting in the reconciliation , and i &apos;m an avid voice , &quot; i &apos;ll go from my journey . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mom was a every night , but we told each other , we told each other , and the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mom &apos;s suffered in the boat .
and it was my job , every night , every night , until her <unk> , i was able to be able to <unk> .
she cleared a <unk> , a <unk> and a business .
and the women came along with their stories about men who couldn &apos;t <unk> the change , <unk> , angry , and <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk> children , the <unk>
and extrinsic and herding became a lot .
1958 were built built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic foot , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in other , i was in the wild life , the tragic people who wore violence , the violence , the <unk> .
but this was so many of the years .
and so , because of this help i was going to be the last year of the <unk> as a boy <unk> of the year .
and i was a <unk> to the next day , and the <unk> didn &apos;t get together .
tan le , , eminent <unk> of <unk> , was a <unk> , and social activist , which was assertive smith , and social activist , which had never heard of which had never heard of which was never imagined .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the whiskey .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to speak about anything .
i wanted to talk to the routine , and the convenience of a <unk> , a mom and two daughters that had been a mother and two daughters that every day , by giving each other stories of a chick and <unk> , we were three three , we were three three of the same bed .
i told my mom , i couldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded reminded me that i was as old as she was back then , as we had the boat .
no no way .
&quot; just as it is , &quot; she said , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i spoke to talk about <unk> and education and <unk> .
and the more open was , i was talking about , the more should i tell .
i met people in all of the <unk> , so many of you did , you know what they were like , was the limits of the .
and i even though i had my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t operate with a career in the way .
there had another <unk> .
and i realized that it &apos;s okay , a latin , a maverick , a <unk> , new , new , new , new , new -- not just fine , but something that you must be grateful , maybe a gift of the fittest .
because , <unk> can lead to because easy means that you have to sell the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;m moved to know enough to know from my <unk> to know that , the world is the world , but not as as you can .
possibilities , not allowed to be allowed to be <unk> .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut .
i &apos;ve collected a little team of people around me , for the <unk> , &quot; not &quot; a <unk> challenge .
a year we had no grand .
at the end of a sign i got a huge <unk> thin surgical <unk> that we shared .
we were working up to the late .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few of a <unk> , and we &apos;ve got the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull .
after just a journey .
my gut .
three months later , i was a pediatrician and the adventure .
before i talk to the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the <unk> , social norm and the local <unk> was the most important person .
life had not changed .
her father died in short , her baby died .
her mother &apos;s moved to the mom .
with 17 , she was the second woman in a <unk> , her mother &apos;s mother .
without support for a <unk> , by a <unk> by a <unk> , by the courts and <unk> in her own case , and a more more than they did .
&quot; don &apos;t go , as a .
i &apos;m just sitting in beijing in sydney , when they died , they died .
i looked at the <unk> and saw them on the other side .
i knew that she was designed to say goodbye .
my mom called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat in <unk> .
we told her stories and <unk> that we were even in their own .
reaching enough , the monk and he said , he would have been the <unk> .
my mom asked us their hand .
she replied , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your hand and the rest of your cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they hold in today tomorrow morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you haven &apos;t live . &quot;
if there &apos;s been in our family , there &apos;s a phd , then it &apos;s going to be through the women .
it &apos;s just going to be who we were and how we &apos;ve seen that men who &apos;ve seen that the men that might have been us to be in the soviet bloc institute .
the defeat were too easy .
now i would like to scratch my own children , and i think about the boat .
who would ever get to be a document ?
yeah , i fear , i fear , in front of the face , before ago .
can you give you a bug in your life , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the the the the oldest <unk> of the engine , the nothing of nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and they certainly could be <unk> , i would do it .
and also , <unk> is <unk> , right now , now , or fifth .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because this is natural , of course , you can &apos;t stand up with his camera .
but still , i started my interest in photography , when i was my first digital fund , in the age of 15 .
i combined it with my former , but it was a bit different different different different different , because it was a bit different different , because when the camera was the process of the process in planning was the process of the process .
and if you give a picture of a camera with a camera , and you can press on the trigger .
so i seemed to work for me , and to go to the photography , to be the right place to be at the right time .
i believed every single one .
so i wanted to create something else , something , something , which is the process that starts when the trigger .
and photographs like this : a a very much more <unk> road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and <unk> <unk> , an amazing plane .
or photographs like this -- and <unk> , same thing , but all of the great goal is to keep an amazing level .
if i say , i mean , i &apos;m going to <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really do , but i want to look like you can do this , in a photograph .
photographs , you know , you need to think about a short moment to find the trick .
so it &apos;s more about a idea that , as a really moment .
but what is the trick that it isn &apos;t really realistic ?
is it going to be the details or the color ?
is it about the light ?
what does the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but the last is , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can make a musical tag .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is we think .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle of reality in the reality , you can take them together and create an alternative reality .
and let me show you an easy example .
we have three basic rules of the physical objects that we can do all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , another kind of thing , you can create something that &apos;s still going to look again , as if it &apos;s been in .
but meanwhile , we know that this is not possible .
so we think , because our brain is not just not really to make it sense .
and i see this same process in the hierarchy of photographs .
it &apos;s really just about making different realities .
so , the things like that a picture , look , i think , is the things that we don &apos;t think about that we don &apos;t think about that we &apos;re not thinking about us .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think , but otherwise you see just sort of <unk> .
so i would say that there are three basic rules of rules , to find a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , they are no three basic images .
but what happens is just like this .
so the first rule is that rituals , the same way that rituals should have been done .
secondly , they should have seven photos .
and these two pictures are often fulfill these two requirements -- from the same height of the same height , and the same <unk> .
third , it &apos;s about trying to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get into the individual pictures and end by having woven .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how the photo was actually actually in the photo .
so by looking at contrast , contrast and detectors and <unk> , we &apos;re going to get the limits between the different images and the <unk> between the different images , <unk> inks and <unk> , we <unk> the limits between the different images and the picture of the ground .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is just a piece of a millionth of the , and lower part of the time .
this painting is completely different from different locations , from different locations .
i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place that can find a place because you don &apos;t have to have to make a compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires much more planning .
and when i had this idea of the winter , i knew i knew i was going to plan to to plan to get the different places for the birth of the puzzle .
for instance , the fish was recorded on a <unk> .
the shore is called a different place .
the <unk> is from a quarry .
and yeah , i &apos;ve got the house on the isle of the island , to make sure .
to get a <unk> , , it &apos;s going to start from me out of me , and then it &apos;s going to be on planning .
i &apos;m going to start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then , after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of very well .
and if you make good progress , can be pretty much , and quite realistic .
so , these are tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re using the idea of the ourselves , is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you why that many electronic <unk> <unk> .
and i think the most important thing is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to talk to us .
and one of the things that we introduced the <unk> introduced , was a <unk> .
not particularly closely -- you can see a cup of scientifically coffee or tea and the patient , the patient , heroine , &quot; how does it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the most important , why all of the most profound <unk> , we have to listen to listen .
this is my <unk> , a very simple thing .
she has a button , the road .
and every morning , i have to go .
and yeah , i &apos;ve got a job like you might recognize .
i &apos;ve been doing this job in the world .
it &apos;s just like , every time i put on the top , , they &apos;re going to be able to bring my data into google . google .
and there &apos;s also been <unk> <unk> , so , he can recognize where my <unk> is not just in the moment where i &apos;m going to support or something , but also , but also , but also with a look at a look at the past .
there &apos;s something like this .
maybe the known as i &apos;ve been talking about 4,000 <unk> .
so every morning , i put my <unk> and people i &apos;m going to talk to me , before i &apos;m sitting in the classroom right now , before i &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
but this is the most important thing that happen , which is what can happen to help patients because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients because that could be used indiscriminately , or it could be the smoking .
but it could also be used to get action from their chairs from their chairs and getting virtually any way to play a game to control their health .
and then , the next week is this .
it &apos;s going to give you this little toy that you &apos;re going to get to an iphone or so .
and it &apos;s going to be the people to measure home , and they would argue to measure their blood vessels to send him to parts of a another dollar than 100 dollars .
on this point , the patient &apos;s the control of the game , you can &apos;t be able to be the captain of the control of challenges that we may be able to be a control of challenges that the <unk> of the health care , the <unk> of the health , high demand , and so on .
do they make them methods , they start with this idea of this patient , patients in the team .
and this can also be able to accomplish this , but also by the fundamental world .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done is , i want to share with you through a short video .
we &apos;ve all <unk> <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our phones .
we know exactly where all the way around the <unk> around the world .
we know one where everybody can do .
and we can find <unk> .
but where the next day of the <unk> <unk> , to help patients ?
we have <unk> , and no one knew it .
no one knew where the contents was founded at the moment .
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve got the netherlands .
we have a website , and a <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share a <unk> , please , please share with the <unk> , please share , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s been <unk> , of course , of course , it &apos;s more closed .
and over 10,000 years , there were been in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we have a <unk> .
we have an app for <unk> , developing reality , to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and someone can use her iphone , and then someone can use her iphone , and within their <unk> , you can also save the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the the next to the
and today , today , we don &apos;t want to just as a <unk> , as the product is called called the product , but as <unk> .
and we want to bring this on a global scale .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us help us to help us understand how to motivate these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re in holiday , and somebody who , or receive your own or anyone else , they can find that kind of like this .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are around the world in the world &apos;s teaching us in the schools of this <unk> .
these may be <unk> , or technician , or technician , just to make sure that the smartest of the <unk> is still in its place .
please help us and try to improve health care , not just to improve something better , but in the palm .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from discussing some bc called addicted to report .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little pursuit of <unk> that we want to get to the past , by drilling ...
it &apos;s the basic thing to be .
this is a short video about what we &apos;re doing .
oh , a moment .
it &apos;s maybe maybe until it &apos;s been .
now — we just like to try to try to do this -- i &apos;ll just give you the video .
no .
this is not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is just a over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so , a few years ago , i &apos;ve got a program program to take a year and in the design , a year , and design and design in a way that , pretty much what they were hate in the government .
the program is called code for code for the music for the music for automated .
we &apos;ve got a few of our fellows and we &apos;re going to work with geneticists .
instead of charging in the third world , we send them in the cafeterias .
and there &apos;s great apps , with urban collaborators .
but what they really do is to show you what &apos;s happening now with technology .
so let &apos;s go .
al &apos;s a <unk> in the city .
here &apos;s what he wants to look after he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is really about the poet , and if he knows is because he knows , it &apos;s not very good at the minimum point when he &apos;s a neanderthal snow .
how did it was to look at this particular occasion to look at aid ?
we had last year , a team of the time in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in boston in
they were in february , and it has been a lot of february to much more <unk> .
and they realized that the city never open up these lines .
but a job , a man named erik <unk> , and this was something else called erik <unk> , and that was the residents of the <unk> , right now , right now .
so he did what everybody got every good idea , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can make a better .
you &apos;re going to get to to the point that if it was armed .
if you do that , you can give it , you can give him a name , and he &apos;s the first al qaeda .
if you don &apos;t do it , you can &apos;t wake up somebody .
so there &apos;s a nice little valve .
this is a fairly humble app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the last year .
but they do something like any guesses .
they &apos;re going to fall .
there &apos;s this guy in the middle of the city , the city of the city , the city of the city , the app of the city , not for snow , but that &apos;s the citizen of the citizen .
it &apos;s very important that these sailors work , but the people work , but the people &apos;s stealing batteries .
so he got the citizen to test them .
and then the app to the app to use the citizen of the citizen to ban the citizen <unk> .
and chicago she did just introduced it , so people would have the <unk> <unk> , when it was <unk> .
we know nine cities , the plan to use this app .
and it &apos;s just discovering it , you know , of course .
if you &apos;re going to know something about the <unk> , you know , it &apos;s not going to be .
the <unk> of software is the main <unk> of software .
we had a team that last year in boston , in boston , in boston , for three months of months for three months months .
it was a method that &apos;s going to find a method that &apos;s going to find the right public school for your children .
and then later , if it was about the normal channels , it &apos;s about two years and it would have been over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not even yet .
there &apos;s a project in the california that the most of the world has two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there &apos;s projects like this on every level of the government .
so , one app that &apos;s written in a few days written written written , and then it &apos;s a kind of shot by <unk> , is a kind of shot out of the government .
they &apos;re exploring how the government could work better -- not more like a long time , like many people think they should think .
and not even just like a <unk> , but rather , more like the internet itself .
and this means that , and that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , you &apos;re a new generation of the government &apos;s law -- not as the government &apos;s government &apos;s sake -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good for digital bodies .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who create tools that are affecting the tools in common , in order to put things together to be done together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &apos;s &quot; for the past country , there &apos;s hundreds of millions of people all the country , and <unk> , every day in your own communities .
they didn &apos;t have the government .
they &apos;re just floating frustrated , but they couldn &apos;t talk about it , you &apos;re gonna you .
and these guys know what we &apos;ve been out of the eyes .
and this is all your feelings about politics and the line of politics , which we really are focused on the words of homegrown , and all the other things that we really are truly focused on the helicopter from the heart of the solar <unk> , &quot; what we do is not alone . &quot;
today , has a lot of people who are in the government .
and if you &apos;re a song that i &apos;m you to think about the <unk> , because things are changing .
politics change is changing ; the government is in the world .
and because the government is comprised of us -- -- selfishly , &quot; we &apos;re going to say , &quot; we think about the people ? -- how we think change the change .
i didn &apos;t know much about government , when i was this program .
and how many people , i thought , i thought , it &apos;s going to choose to choose people into a bribe .
now after two years , i went to the conclusion that it was in the end of the back to the end .
this is the <unk> for service and information .
there &apos;s been going to be heard about your city &apos;s <unk> .
if you ever have to have to have to have to have to have to have been in your <unk> , to work in your fellow , like our fellow scott <unk> , , to the government of many problems , including that a <unk> in your house .
scott , scott , so scott , and this is what happens .
he &apos;s called <unk> , &quot; the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have a idea . he &apos;s beginning to do with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can &apos;t open your da vinci in your house and really deep and see a really deep music and see , &quot; if the livestock is happening ? &quot;
and that worked . round of scott .
but this was not the end of the fittest .
boston didn &apos;t just have a <unk> .
it has a app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we haven &apos;t written written this app .
this is the work very smart new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
one day -- this is a <unk> report -- it came up , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> , can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them ? &quot;
but what happens &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s different .
scott labels began to human .
but on , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; it &apos;s all everybody can see .
and in this case , it &apos;s a neighbor .
and the next one we &apos;ve got to get , you get a little bit there , &quot; i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . it &apos;s alive ?
the <unk> on the page . went home .
nice night , cute <unk> . &quot;
pretty much .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital that .
and it &apos;s also good for the government to get the <unk> into the brain .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily not necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help other other .
a citizen , another citizen , another citizen , but the government played here a central role .
they &apos;re empowered these two people .
and you would have been able to connect them with state-owned , if that had been previously , but a neighbor is a widespread better better and cheaper to stop <unk> .
if you &apos;re planning to the other , we &apos;re going to determine our municipalities .
we call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things , is that we need to think , is that government is not the same thing as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that &apos;s a really matter of the input .
and our contributions to the system is the vote .
how many we are -- and we sometimes we expect a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders , and then we expect a lot of energy to choose a new political political leaders -- and then we expect that the government is affecting our values and then has not a lot of the needs .
this is because the government is like a <unk> ocean , and politics is the top of the top .
and what &apos;s about what &apos;s what we call model .
and we use this word with these contempt .
but it &apos;s the contempt that we have to do , and we pay for we pay to pay for we pay to pay for us , something else , and then we embed ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we have to do this institution for us , we have to do it sexy .
because this is where the actual <unk> .
we need to put on the heart of the government .
so the sinaloa federation has done it .
did you have guys seen this guys ?
it &apos;s a group of citizen who has a very precise report report written , which has a response to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not politically active , that &apos;s <unk> active .
well , for those of us , the government is time that we think about the world that we want to think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you need to introduce the most enormous challenges you have to ask .
do we really do what we need to do is we need to achieve without cutting the institution that can us do ?
one government is completely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology can make it possible to be able to do is possible to find something that can actually can achieve something to do something can achieve society .
and there &apos;s a generation of democracy , the <unk> internet , and the white thing is that it &apos;s not hard to do things like , and they &apos;re just to build things right now .
now , the average of our own , so i &apos;m unfortunately , unfortunately , unfortunately , unfortunately , almost a generation of mine older than most of them .
this is a generation that has been the way to see your voice as well .
they &apos;re not fighting that fight the struggle , we all of the who are receiving , they all agree .
you can click your mind , and each time , and they &apos;re doing it .
so , if you ever faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t necessarily think they don &apos;t necessarily much .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that help the work of government improve .
and these apps is to use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a fire hydrant , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
and sure , we would have these women all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we are not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers the government is that ripple and <unk> .
we are more than we are .
and we &apos;re going to improve the government to improve the cosmic .
so i &apos;m going to show the question for you all here : if it &apos;s about the great , important things we need to do , we will only be a lot of voices , or will we need a lot of hands ?
thank you .
and freud , my role is how to deconstruct the people who are really thinking about how to deconstruct friends here , i would tell you what i really think about , here , i would tell you what i really think about , here , i would tell you what i really think about , and also try to understand what that was that we can &apos;t talk about .
i &apos;m going to start by this , you know , the payload slide .
... could you ask you to show you a little bit of the slide .
this is a slide that i picked up my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather than the <unk> form .
this slide shows data from a analysis of <unk> <unk> , compared to the performance of <unk> <unk> , compared to the performance of a <unk> device .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as external as as external as as external as that we &apos;re often put in our field , a kind of a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a fascinating <unk> in the <unk> .
and this is a fundamental idea that we need to use this type of workshops in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically that i &apos;m talking about to talk about this .
so , if you can remember the light .
i &apos;m going to do something more , because i &apos;m going to draw the same thing here .
now , why do we stop the technology to <unk> curves ?
the reason for this is , if i would say it on a normal curve , where we are , we say , this is a constant component of technology that i &apos;m going to say , so , what i &apos;m going to do with a graph , which i want to be the graph .
and it &apos;s like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
if i want to do another technology , we &apos;ll say , a <unk> , let &apos;s say , on the <unk> , very <unk> , in a flat flat line .
but if you &apos;re something like this , that &apos;s the <unk> conditions .
so , if you would propose the <unk> as the gothic system would like to put sour the <unk> , we could put in a taxi , and 30 seconds we were in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not as quickly as quickly .
there &apos;s been there never before in history of the history of the <unk> , these kinds of growth , through which is doubling all the way across the way .
so i want to ask you , if you want to look at these exponential curves , you see if you look at these exponential curves , you &apos;re not forever .
it &apos;s not possible that anything for you and it forever so quickly .
there &apos;s two ways .
either , this is going to be a classic <unk> like this , until something new , or it &apos;s going to happen .
this is it in about .
well i &apos;m optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really about that , then that means that we &apos;re here in a transition here in a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the most creative world in a new way of world .
so i want to ask the question that i want to say , is , is , is how this new world is going to be ?
what &apos;s this new state that the world are going to slow down ?
because the transition seems to be very confusing if you &apos;re in the inside .
when i was a kid , there was the future of the future , and the people often often know what was happening in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still the future .
we don &apos;t do .
so in other words , the future has been doubling every year to this world , i &apos;m going to be on this world .
i think i &apos;m sure that something is something worthwhile .
the transition is the transition . we can &apos;t feel it .
and we know , there &apos;s no sense to try to use 30 or 50 years to look at the future , because everything is so that a simple <unk> of what we don &apos;t do anything now .
i want to talk about what might be going to talk about what we &apos;re in .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really really nothing to do with technology or computer .
because i really think that really need to understand this really , we need to look back and see the thing that you see .
and i want to look at this , on the earth &apos;s hierarchy of life on earth .
i think that &apos;s what makes sense that you &apos;re in some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s a great <unk> , <unk> <unk> with lots of many <unk> chemicals .
so , if you look at the way , when you were doing , then we have a pretty good picture of the good picture of how they do the <unk> .
i think there &apos;s theories that start to understand how everything comes out with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a a story which is what is that that is that this is little <unk> that different types of chemicals in chemicals .
some of these <unk> are housed a special arrangement of chemicals that allowed them to work and grow .
all of those who were so hard .
these little <unk> were the <unk> <unk> .
but not about the <unk> , not about the today because every single one of them was just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and each time , if it makes it together , they &apos;re chemicals chemicals .
so every day was a little bit different .
in fact , the <unk> of the <unk> , which was used to the growth of the growth <unk> , but more and more and more and <unk> .
so , these are able to survive and <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> into <unk> .
so , this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting is going to announce if these <unk> has a trick .
in a way that we don &apos;t understand yet , this <unk> , this <unk> , the ability to have the ability to information .
they learn to be learned to store the recipe of the cell than information , which is called dna .
in other words , they &apos;ve found in this <unk> , evolutionary you can find evolutionary kind of <unk> , they &apos;ll <unk> , so that this information can be stored so that this information and be copied .
the amazing thing is that this kind of synergies across the years of view of the time , the years of view of the human billions of years , in which they were in .
in fact , the recipe for us , is going to look at our genes , from the same code and the same .
and each creatures are the same raw letters , and the same code .
we are the era that we &apos;re just to write the <unk> , in this code .
and i &apos;ve been 100 <unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos;s <unk> of a white <unk> that i &apos;m going to be sitting in airports .
in fact , what i &apos;ve done is , i have a code -- the code is made from normal letters that we use to use the code -- the code is the <unk> and i &apos;ve got a piece of dna and descends it out of the .
so if somebody can always say a hundred copies of my favorite , and even enough enough for everybody in this room , and even in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
i would be a <unk> , i would have been able to upgrade , and in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the <unk> of dna was a more mature step .
and the <unk> that cells -- that made them happy for a second , for a second .
but then another thing happened another experiment , very much more complicated , very much more complicated , where the things were transformed different , and information , so that it &apos;s benefiting from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you can know that , but bacteria can actually can actually make your dna .
this is why the reason for example , for example , for example , for example , for example .
some bacteria found out how they can have been from penicillin and each information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are manned because the bacteria are communicating on the penicillin , because the bacteria are communicating .
these communication , the reasons of <unk> , which in the mesh vacation were ; ; they were <unk> .
so they &apos;ve been together together , or they went together , they went to the point , and that if a community , they were repeatedly and the evolution of community .
the <unk> is now there , where these devices are so <unk> that they decided that they &apos;re going to write the recipe for the entire community in a <unk> .
and the next phase of the time about a meter of years .
and at this point , we have <unk> communities , <unk> communities , <unk> <unk> , which are together as a single outcome of individual organism .
we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not addressed anymore .
your skin are useless without numbing , muscle muscle , and so on .
so these are <unk> , so that the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution , which the evolution of the individual cell , but the whole <unk> <unk> that we call .
the next step now , the inside of these communities .
the <unk> started to dial information .
and they created special structures , which is that other than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that created the <unk> .
they started specialists to the community , specifically structures that would be responsible for learning , which is responsible for learning , understanding the understanding of information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system system
this was a evolutionary advantage .
because this is an individual -- learning , within the period of a single organism , instead of a single organism , instead of a single time .
so a organism could learn to eat a particular lunch , because they were bad , because they were bad and and it was sick , the last time he ate .
this could be written in the lifetime of a single organism among years because these information are being used by the way that information were being used by the hiv that these companies were dying , because they weren &apos;t going to be there .
so the nervous system has the <unk> keyboard using this special <unk> , because evolution could have been inside a different place .
she could have been a <unk> <unk> .
what &apos;s happening in , is that the individual organisms has been bothering a way to communicate .
and even as an example , the <unk> of this is the human language .
it &apos;s quite amazing , though , you &apos;re thinking about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea .
i &apos;m sitting here and you can basically reveal me in the very scary , i &apos;ve got to put a look to create a similarly , a very flexible to create my head , a few resemblance to create my original idea .
so we take something complicated , swing it into a sequence of sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the minds of others .
so this allows us to work back as a unified form organism .
and what we actually did is we actually did , humanity , is we &apos;ve got to <unk> .
we &apos;re looking at the same stages of the blogosphere -- the our our methods , the our own methods , like that data , we &apos;re going to start .
the invention of the language was a little bit step into this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve built in our community to allow this information .
and it &apos;s all the way we all all together together , the much bigger is , and also capable of developing ways we were it available .
so , now , evolution can happen in the period of time .
you &apos;ve also seen <unk> <unk> , where he got a <unk> evolution in the &quot; program , &quot; the program showed , right now .
so we have the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the first steps of the story that i told you , <unk> a billion years .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> dollars a hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be a few political areas .
the process is spinning itself , and i think , is , <unk> is the word for the word is that -- if something has a little bit .
the more changes it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this triangular curve .
we see the process that are isolating themselves .
i live in the building of computers , and i know that i &apos;m going to build the mechanism that i use to build computer computers , not able to use no reflexes in the .
my current activity is to be in order to design a high complexity , but it &apos;s impossible to design a traditional complexity , this sense of design sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what designers are the designers of thinking about the <unk> , the machine and the machine , and the <unk> makes something that takes our skills , and the machine that takes our skills , better and faster than we ever have .
and it makes it partly to play the methods that we don &apos;t even understand .
one method that &apos;s interesting interesting is , and i &apos;m going to highlight in the last time , it &apos;s evolution . evolution .
we &apos;re going to fill a <unk> in the machine , which is the <unk> .
to give you an example of a , in the extreme , we can create a program that evolved from a program that stretches of cooperative .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , <unk> , hundred million dollars a bunch of <unk> .
now , you can take this randomly prints , and they all of this randomly chosen , and at the bottom of the next day , what &apos;s my most likely to the next . &quot;
so in other words , i want to say what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to recruit numbers , this would be a simple example that i &apos;ve ever been .
so , as you find , you find that , which can have been able to rank .
of course , the chance of randomly engineers was very small , that they were fighting in unlikely to have a chance to be numbers , so that &apos;s not the court to do this .
but one of whom may be lucky numbers with something , in the right order .
now , i say , &quot; computers , take the ones that my colleagues are the next 10 percent of the next .
radio , <unk> , the rest of the rest .
now , <unk> <unk> , the numbers of the best .
and it &apos;s something like the method of the <unk> , the <unk> . &quot;
take two programs and they &apos;re talking about children by the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids who are the <unk> of the two programs .
now , i have a new generation of programs , which was inspired by the combinations of <unk> , which is more effective about the most effective way that are closer to the most effective than others .
tell , &quot; please give me this process . &quot;
hammer them .
maybe some mutations .
and then the whole thing starts with another generation .
all of these generations need only milliseconds milliseconds .
and so i can make a evolution of hundreds of years in a computer in the computer , or in the <unk> , some of them have some hours .
and then i finally conclude , i get <unk> , the numbers of numbers .
the fact is , these are so efficient <unk> than each of the program that i can possibly have ever had to be able to do .
if i look at this , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to understand it .
it &apos;s organic and strange .
but they did the job .
i know i &apos;m sure secure , i &apos;m sure secure , you know , they &apos;re from <unk> programs , which is done the job .
because your lives of them is when they &apos;re the job right .
i &apos;ll go into a 747 with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a map of <unk> and says , &quot; oh look . look .
there &apos;s this airplane in <unk> <unk> , which works together to make a little bit safer , which works together . &quot;
we know that a <unk> isn &apos;t <unk> if it &apos;s too complicated .
so returning to rely on computer , for a process that makes us expanding a process that &apos;s really striking .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexities as a little bit higher methods than the physical methods .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the opportunity of it .
<unk> <unk> : the technology
we use this <unk> now to make computer much faster , so that we &apos;re able to use is able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able faster .
so there &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems like .
because all of these new technologies have themselves .
we &apos;re going to do .
we &apos;re at the point of being the <unk> , as a <unk> evolved to <unk> .
so we are the <unk> and we can &apos;t really make us feel quite frightened of the hell we &apos;re actually standing on .
we &apos;re in this <unk> .
but i really really really really really really really really really really really believe that it &apos;s something .
i think it &apos;s very empowering to say that we are the most critical of the evolution .
and i think we all of these are part of the creation of what &apos;s going to be .
well , the lunch is , and i think i &apos;m going to go back here before i &apos;m going to go .
my story starts in rajasthan , a hundred years ago .
i was in the desert in the desert , with <unk> <unk> .
we talked about that , nothing has transformed this time for the time of ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel , we wanted to take into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we are now proceed to the .
at the time , as the great indian <unk> , <unk> thirst , <unk> , he took a bow , and water pipes .
now we &apos;re going to do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and the magic had been replaced by machines .
that was really sad .
i got something scared about technology .
it was afraid i could lose the ability to lose the day without camera without camera without camera without camera without without camera and without mine .
i found that technology can &apos;t do it , and not kill .
when i was a little girl , i was a grandfather , i was the <unk> <unk> .
this piece of <unk> technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> of a world full of the world , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> my mind .
i came out , as a <unk> clocks and descends our cameras from them to dream .
they also gave us off .
and so i used to technology in the world of technology , to see how i could use them to kill .
with 16 , i started books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as device , it &apos;s as device , the reader in the world .
it can know how we think it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s also beginning to be able to be able to listen and touch , and touch .
that &apos;s not going to be more .
but what do we do ?
i &apos;m going to just go into a interactive app .
here &apos;s : &quot; we &apos;ll have to make your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- -- here &apos;s the box -- here &apos;s , &quot; i write my name -- &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;ve been a character in the book .
and then another letter , and the ipad is actually -- and the ipad is through gps , where i &apos;m -- is really right to me .
the kid in me is really about the possibility .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i &apos;m going to be the magic of the childhood , these ideas that we all know as children .
fireflies in a glass , i always found it .
so you have to repeat the ipad and the fireflies of the fireflies .
and the the the the the the the the the the the the rest of the rest .
another idea that worries me is when a kid has been a single galaxy in a single street .
and so , in every book , there &apos;s a little baby clip that i &apos;m traveling here to the magic device in the machine .
and this is a map .
<unk> had always been cards , but these cards were static .
this map grows and the <unk> in the rest of the book .
she &apos;s also starting to have other locations .
i &apos;m going to go back here .
it &apos;s important for me to do something that is inherently <unk> , but also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we all of <unk> and <unk> , but many people are beyond india , but many people are familiar with india ?
the poor <unk> were thousands of years in <unk> was caught in <unk> <unk> , in a old book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary history for children .
a story that starts with new issues , like the <unk> .
and the theme of the <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is , in their <unk> , in their computers , to sit in their own computers , to their computers .
but now , with the tasmanian technology , we can take our children into their technology .
in a interaction , you &apos;ll be a search of the book , you have to go out and join the camera and the camera , pictures of the pictures of the pictures of natural pictures .
as a kid i had collections of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and that &apos;s not more children .
this is called <unk> , <unk> . you have to go to tag in a photograph of a flower from a flower from a flower to make a flower photograph of a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to <unk> a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you create a digital collection of photos that you can ask .
a kid in london , the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve got a <unk> . &quot;
one kid in india , &quot; i &apos;ve got a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network about a digital collection of photographs that you actually have .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to magic , and technology .
in the next book , we hosted a a a a a a a a interaction at a animation of the ipads of ipads and can see a animation that was on a plant before the house .
on one spot the screen , the screen with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the <unk> , they &apos;re interacting and the rest of the world .
we all move on a world where the sensitivity of technology and systematic and and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and we can get closer to the magic world and and the magic , and the love of our childhood is through a story .
thank you .
this is really a very extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of the most imaginative of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or <unk> .
i have seen the most imaginative members of the socially of the socially of the socially of the socially of the <unk> , and in places that there are very much .
here at ted , and , and , what is that -- how robotics that is , has a lot of my power .
in the short time , there was a clear to a clear , ted has an identity .
you can say things , you can say things that are the world .
and sometimes when something talk about ted , it gets meaning , and force that otherwise otherwise not supposed to be otherwise .
i say , because i think identity is very important .
we have some fabulous presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a top-down meaning is meaning , but the words is particularly to occur .
as a doctor can do good . as a <unk> doctor &apos;s worth of a doctor , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about this power of identity .
i haven &apos;t learned in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i was a big <unk> household by a family , a traditional <unk> household , which was a <unk> <unk> , who was welcomed by a <unk> dominated , and this was the <unk> .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , they had a impact .
she had the last word in every time .
she was also the start in the beginning of the start in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in virginia in virginia when virginia .
she was born to recruit and the experience of slavery in slavery , you very strong .
my grandmother was powerful , but she was also <unk> .
if i met when i met it as a young boy , she came to me and <unk> me .
she was i realized that i could just lightweight , then she would take me .
one or two hours later , if i met her , they came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you know , you feel my work ? &quot;
and if i say , &quot; she said , &quot; she <unk> me , when i was saying , &quot; i would skip me in the quiet .
she was something that made you was always always wanted to be about her .
the only problem is they were teaching kids .
my mom was the youngest of her children &apos;s children .
sometimes when i wanted to work with her , it was difficult to create your attention .
my cousins and around the .
i remember , i must have been eight or nine , i &apos;ve got a heart , and in the living room . my cousins .
my grandmother sat at the end of the <unk> and the <unk> .
i thought , this was a game .
i saw her and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
this was the 15 or 20 minutes , then she stood up and i came to the hand , and he stood up and said , &quot; come on the hand , and i &apos;ll go . &quot;
i remember remember what it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out , and he said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you need to tell you it . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , for the past . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat me and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to announce you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything , you can do everything . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , granny .
she said , &quot; you know , &quot; as a first responders i was teaching your ears . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby &apos;s my baby , and you &apos;ve got to have to have to be the kid . &quot;
i loved my mom , so i said , &quot; yeah , granny , granny , i &apos;ll do . &quot;
then she said , &quot; as a physicist , i thought she always do the right thing , &quot; if it &apos;s hard hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yeah , granny , granny , granny , granny . i promise . &quot;
then finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you need to say goodbye , is &quot; you &apos;re never going to be in angels . &quot;
well , i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yes , granny , . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the country , rural mid- &apos; old , rural mid- &apos; old , and i &apos;ve got a brother , which is a year and a half times .
when i was about 14 or 15 , i got my brother home after home and took this <unk> beer home after my sister and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just just like a lot of them .
then he took a <unk> beer and his sister &apos;s sister and she took them and then , and then she was going to be one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no , no , no . it &apos;s not just beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to do that , you &apos;re going to do everything , what we do .
i had what was your sister had what was going on .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do , not just to be .
my brother , me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? well , what &apos;s going on ?
then he saw me on the face , and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t get crazy about the entertainment ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what &apos;s talking about you ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma told everybody told us what they &apos;re supposed to do . &quot;
i was devastated devastated .
i &apos;m going to find you .
i should not do this .
this is what this is going to transfer that .
i &apos;m a 52 old and i swore i never lived a a kind of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s imperative . i say that it &apos;s <unk> . i say that identity .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can say , we can say , we can tell people around the people around the world that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought , they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they would be something .
my grandfather was in the <unk> prison in prison .
my favorite leaders of champagne dying of <unk> .
and they believed that these topics were to be able to be the doctor .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
so civil wars were 300,000 people in <unk> and <unk> prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest incarceration of the world .
seven million people are focused on the wildest of the chinese economy or with <unk> .
i think , is our opinion changes our world .
in socially , and black health care of the population of the population of the population of despair and hopelessness , due to this change .
one of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in prison , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities in the country -- from los angeles , oil about philadelphia , oil prices are in prison -- global 60 percent of all young men in the prison , in prison , on the isle of young young men , on the isle of the black young , or <unk> <unk> .
our system is not just talking about the questions of questions that have to do with self-reflection , it &apos;s going to be done by tinkering .
we have a <unk> that they saved much better when they &apos;re much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty of the rich and the .
fortune , not <unk> , the result .
yet we seem to be satisfied with it .
one policy from fear and anger , and that &apos;s not our problems .
we have lost the touch .
i think interesting is interesting .
there &apos;s a few <unk> of a solar flares .
my community <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ll miss the <unk> when they &apos;re astoundingly in the field .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re here today in the middle today , you get lost population of the male population of the male population is lost their own lost .
we <unk> , in 10 years , the circulation of the <unk> is just going to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is <unk> .
i &apos;m going to be children .
many of my favorites are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the kids kids are kids to death in jail . jail .
in this course , there &apos;s been a for children , <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve got a lot of the way that we run a lot .
the only country in the world .
i was <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of the most powerful answer is an interesting question .
we think , because it &apos;s taught us to think that the real question is : has a person to die for a return of him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can think differently depending on how we see our identity .
the other points is not : somebody &apos;s got a serious death , but we have to kill it to kill it ?
i think this fascinating .
the death toll in america .
on nine people , we &apos;ve been executed a we we &apos;ve been doing for the first time , we &apos;ve been discussing for the <unk> and from the death .
a astonishing <unk> , a astonishing <unk> .
i think this fascinating .
we would never fly somebody to fly someone to nine planes , when nine planes , the ones .
but somehow we can create it , and it &apos;s about this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our lives .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk about this questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i &apos;m going to talk about my students , i &apos;m talking about about my students . i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time for the end against the <unk> , to the beginning of the world &apos;s sake .
we don &apos;t know , very much about this .
but for the past in this country was a time terror .
in many areas people have scared of <unk> , <unk> .
or 10,000 .
it was fear of terror , the her life .
this older people come to me and say , &quot; mr. <unk> , <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to stop , &quot; you know , you &apos;re going to stop , &quot; you know , it &apos;s going to stop the people to deal with social and after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- they say , &quot; they said that we grew up . &quot;
and after the terrorism of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> <unk> <unk> and apartheid .
and yet we &apos;ve got to our country , a dynamic ... we don &apos;t necessarily like to talk about our problems .
we &apos;re not liking about our history .
and so , why don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of historical is the historical context .
we &apos;re going to go all the time .
we &apos;re always talking new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we don &apos;t think we &apos;re not willing to think of the truth of the truth and the reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not too valuable to overcome the willingness to truth without connecting to truth .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness to be able to live in this country .
i &apos;ve been some presentations in germany .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists standing down to my talk , and i said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing disturbing you &apos;re talking about , it &apos;s deeply to hear it . &quot;
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no <unk> .
and of course , it can never give them in germany . &quot;
it &apos;s been a silence , and then a woman , &quot; and then a woman &apos;s impossible to the killing of humans .
it would be <unk> from us , and humans . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel like , in a world where the german state of the south state of the south state of <unk> , especially when they were a lot of jewish .
it would be like .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in this country , in this country , in this country , in this country , we &apos;re going to end up -- here &apos;s the risk of old <unk> , we &apos;re going to get people -- here &apos;s the risk of rising , we &apos;re humans -- here &apos;s the risk of black and the victim -- in the same states , the body are black , in their trunks in their trunks .
and yet there &apos;s there there &apos;s mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t have to deal with these difficult topics , they are positive and wonderful things .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , these realities are <unk> <unk> , abuse , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;m just allowed to quote both .
because we talk about hope that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to a greater world .
for me , this means to talk about the poor that , and talk about the poor that will never be the most likely to be ted .
but think of think that in our own life is integrated .
we all need to think about the things that we can &apos;t see .
we do this . we we consequently , we &apos;re really appreciate .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just about the .
they come from ideas , the <unk> are being transformed by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> that i think believe that they &apos;re us not open up to the imf and <unk> things , but also , but also , it &apos;s also stimulating and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the great <unk> politicians , once said .
&quot; when we wanted to do with the oppression , we wanted to make all kinds of things , and what we needed to do hope was a mental illness that are trying to be <unk> , sometimes in <unk> , sometimes in <unk> , and yet to be .
this mental time is the core of the core of the thing that i think that is also the most selfish to be .
there &apos;s no sense of technology and design that allowed us to be human , and even if we hadn &apos;t even eyes and ears for poverty , for poverty , and injustice .
i want to warn you , this kind of identity is very much more more than if we don &apos;t worry about us .
she &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a youngster , i was the privilege of the privilege to come back to the big bang , pink parks .
woman parks came back to <unk> , where they came back to <unk> , the <unk> -- a incredible <unk> -- a incredible <unk> -- a incredible <unk> -- a incredible <unk> -- a white , <unk> , a white , whose husband , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women are pushed ahead and they just act .
and then , and skiing me called <unk> , and said , &quot; <unk> , woman , woman , woman , we want to do .
do you want to go to <unk> ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , yeah . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what do they do when they are ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going listen . &quot;
and i went around and just simply just waving .
it was always inspiring , so huddled .
and one day i sat there and i was listening to a couple of hours , and after a couple of hours , he told me , &quot; well , what is <unk> , say what the heck is the most authentic music is right .
what do you do ? &quot;
i started with my baseline .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do experiments , against injustice .
<unk> wants to help people who were trying to be .
we want to redesign the <unk> and discrimination in the permafrost .
we want to <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> for children .
we want to do something about the death .
we want to do the number of the <unk> .
we want to abolish . &quot;
i mean , my dad talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
she said , &quot; you &apos;re going to do it , very tired . &quot;
then a complete woman <unk> himself in front of me , and i said , &quot; and i said , &quot; and therefore you have to be very hierarchical . &quot;
and so i think therefore the <unk> should be <unk> .
we need to ask ourselves to ask ourselves this challenges : this is called the <unk> .
because ultimately , it depends on our humanity , our brains .
in my work , i &apos;ve been very simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a few of the simple things .
we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s applies for everybody humans on the planet .
if somebody is , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody does something that &apos;s not heard , it isn &apos;t just a <unk> .
even who &apos;s not just a murderer , isn &apos;t just a murderer .
and because this is so that , there &apos;s an basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
i think that in many parts of this country , and with certainty in many parts , the opposite of poverty is not wealth wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that &apos;s the opposite of poverty is .
and finally , i think , although , although , although even though it &apos;s inspiring , and inspiring , and inspiring , and inspiring , and inspiring , and the way that we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and minds .
there &apos;s a society , as they do their rich and powerful and the and the <unk> and the <unk> , but it &apos;s how they &apos;re doing with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to start the amazing thing that are us to understand how to make us .
sometimes i &apos;m going to get the balance .
sometimes i sometimes i sometimes have too .
i &apos;m going to show you tired of how we all all .
sometimes most of our minds will have predicted , and we think .
i &apos;m going to show these kids that are sold to very hard hostile .
i go into the wheelhouse and visit a <unk> , the 13 or 14 years old , the 13 years , and the adult first mate was about to stand at the courts .
then i ask myself , how could it happen ?
how can you get a judge someone in a little bit of something that isn &apos;t ?
the judge of it as adults , but i see a kid .
one night , i was able to go into long , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn into something different , then he has to be interpersonal <unk> .
so , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you also have to be able to do that .
and because it was wartime , and i couldn &apos;t think more really quite , i started working on a space .
i had a <unk> <unk> , poor black boys .
and i started working on this examination . the headline said , &quot; the headline said , &quot; the headline said , &quot; the headline said , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in my final , i explained that the failure of the <unk> and the police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police and police
there was a crazy idea about that in this country , which is more <unk> , that it &apos;s only trouble .
and so , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know more , whether i could only be really , or the total of him .
and i couldn &apos;t just written it , but also the court of the <unk> .
a few months ago , and i had forgotten everything .
but then finally , but then finally decided i was trying to go to the court and this crazy nap .
i was going to car , and was really impressed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought , it &apos;s hard to be so painful .
and then i ended up from my car and went to the staircase .
when i was the staircase , the court <unk> was a stable man , black man , the <unk> .
when he saw me , he came up to me and said , &quot; who are you going to be ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m lawyer lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re like lawyer ? &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
and then he remembered me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m tuned proud . &quot;
and i must say , there were a force .
it &apos;s surprisingly me to come in in mind , identity , the ability to each individual , something to a community , a myriad of hope .
well , i was called the <unk> .
as soon as the judge me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , they have this crazy ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started to debate .
they came to the people , because they were saving better , because they were better .
i had this crazy things .
<unk> came and <unk> and <unk> .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people were full of people who were the actors were , the actors were that we talked about skin talking about skin
i saw the janitors and i saw the janitors and go down .
he looked back through the window and couldn &apos;t hear the whole <unk> .
he went down to the and fell .
and then , finally , this older man was the black man with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat directly behind me , almost almost entirely on the <unk> .
10 minutes later , the judge of a judge .
as a pause came in the break , the was the easiest way that was in the <unk> .
this <unk> <unk> , the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man said he was going on . he saw the <unk> , he saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m not going to say , &quot; i &apos;m not going to say , &quot; i &apos;m not going to give you out of your eyes .
i &apos;m a ted audience because i think believe that many of you have understood that many of you have gone , that the moral judgments of the universe is far , but it &apos;s the justice .
that we are not completely evolved to withstand human rights and <unk> .
that our vulnerability is the <unk> every single thing .
and we &apos;re our visions of technology and creation , and design , and design and creativity and justice .
and especially i want to see those of you who &apos;s looking at the rate , just lose the goal of your eyes : lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give you the goal .
they have this audience , this community , this community has seen a tedtalk and to help them and make something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s all possibilities .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a really a parallel where it &apos;s about , actually a really effort to make a effort to company , something about the <unk> <unk> , the otherwise in politics .
here , in california , california , you &apos;ll be able to provide a billion dollars for the <unk> dollars for the <unk> dollars .
and yet , we &apos;ve got some of all of the <unk> <unk> in all of the <unk> .
it &apos;s 56 percent of all of the <unk> , they don &apos;t have a <unk> .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is the <unk> , we propose the money in more and safety .
i think there &apos;s ways of opportunities .
as the last three decades is the <unk> in america in america .
this is a fact that &apos;s often with the <unk> .
what would you say somebody that that ?
well , actually , actually , actually , the numbers of the <unk> is not very simplistic .
the most popular of the <unk> in this country , not in the class , in this country , not really in the class of the <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so they are high levels of high seas .
we have <unk> , and we have evolved from the rhetoric .
now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , people always put people to always make people for the theft of the theft , which they were able to provide the ultimate <unk> , instead of the sacrifices .
i think we need to help people , to help people who are a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> society , not less .
and i think that our minds are helping us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they have a really natural thing to the .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you , thank you at ted . thank you .
three : a <unk> <unk> a subtle <unk> .
the other ones : famine in somalia , and then three : o.c. muslims .
three : why is a <unk> <unk> , and then five <unk> .
rs : social media . and now seven 7 : 65 users .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> 9 : <unk> 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
different : <unk> . <unk> .
the recession -- <unk> . <unk> , egypt . egypt .
crisis . death .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips that i collected about six months ago -- but also the last six days can be a days , or the last six years .
the fact that the media can make it easier to show us negative , because our minds are exactly the same thing in the topics .
and there &apos;s also very good reason .
each second , every second , our senses are much more information than that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that means means the brain ever process .
and because of all of us is important than our survival , the first one of our <unk> , the amygdala that we have .
so the amygdala is our power system , our <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> the entire information on the search for the danger of risk of risk in our environment .
so if we see the news we see it , we prefer to keep the negative results .
and the old adage that if it &apos;s called <unk> , that demand the demand is very true .
well , all our our our our our our our our digital devices , the day of all these negative news ticker <unk> , there &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re developing .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it always goes to worse .
but possibly , this is not the case .
possibly the fact that it &apos;s the most .
perhaps accelerating in the past century , we &apos;ve been making in the past century in the last century , we &apos;ve done in the next three decades in a variety of forces , that we can be able to create a world of the world .
well i don &apos;t say that we don &apos;t say that we don &apos;t have any big trouble -- climate change , and we &apos;ve got to have this .
and as humans we are much better in it , problems , problems , problems , but they &apos;re ultimately .
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve done in the last century , we &apos;ve reached the evolution of development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy are more than doubled the increased <unk> of the world &apos;s population <unk> of the world &apos;s population .
child has to be a tenth .
and it &apos;s also the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> is the absolute growth .
steve pinker has shown us that we showed it in a very peaceful time of life , in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> in the last several years , 25 percent of 25 percent by 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forgot .
and we &apos;ll increase our expectations .
we actually redefined poverty .
think that a large fraction of americans who are living among living in power , access to power , water , water , water , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , ngos and cars .
the richest of the richest capitalists of the past century , the earth &apos;s circulatory earth , could never break up .
the foundation of the things that are technologies , and they &apos;re going to <unk> .
my great friend of mine has pointed us that every tool that every tool that every tool that every tool that every tool , on moore &apos;s own cars , and then doubling all 12 to 24 months .
so , for the mobile phone in your pocket time , a decade less less than a decade less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now , look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last several years .
notice two things about this curve .
first , as you can do -- in good times , in good times , war , war or peace , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of the brain computers that are possible computers .
they &apos;re missing for the patient &apos;s , for the patient &apos;s problems .
and then , despite their <unk> <unk> on the left side , it &apos;s upwards .
so the more the world is accelerating .
and on this curve , on moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary new technologies that we have .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; i call something that my friends in the same &quot; <unk> , &quot; sensors , and networks , the sum of our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> biology , <unk> biology , <unk> and food , digital medicine , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have the victory of <unk> <unk> , at risk ?
this was a little bit .
i &apos;ve also used to <unk> the newspapers and the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; instead of human adversaries . &quot;
&quot; risk is not easy .
it &apos;s about that , the language of language .
so imagine that this artificial intelligence every artificial intelligence every idea of a transistor in the quiet .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i here at ted , a new university , singularity . &quot;
we bring our technology to these technologies , with collaborator collaborator space , with collaborator sequencing , to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and each year we ask the students , businesses , businesses , products and services that within a decade of a decade , the other lives of billions of human beings .
think about that , a group of students live the lives of people &apos;s lives .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
today we can have been on dozens of companies , we &apos;ve been able to have this .
if i think , if i think , we don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everybody in this planet ; it &apos;s about me to create a life of life .
it &apos;s about making from the code .
and it &apos;s the brain is <unk> , and technology is a resource .
here &apos;s a sample .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the mid-19th century .
he &apos;s the guy left .
he has been the king of <unk> for dinner .
<unk> soldiers was <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> are <unk> .
so 500,000 time , the most valuable thing that most of the most valuable metal on the planet , as a gold and <unk> .
this is why the reason why the theme of the <unk> from aluminum .
although 500,000 percent of the <unk> , it &apos;s not as close metal .
it &apos;s going to be able to oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , so that we use it with our <unk> .
and then let &apos;s make the analogy in the future .
we think about the <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet at a planet , more energy than we consume it .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> all the crops of the 88 of the earth &apos;s land .
it &apos;s not about the brain , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you have been able to get it into 50 percent of the hills of the <unk> , <unk> rupees in 50 percent of the <unk> rupees in comparison , <unk> rupees in the comparison .
the cost of solar labor in the last year .
last month , this has been published with a study , which shows that to the end of this decade in the united states in the united states in the united states in the united states , in the united states in the united states in the national community in the national park .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll have water in the abundance .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan , the <unk> 1990 , when it was at saturn , when it was at saturn , back in the direction ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it was ?
&quot; a a a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet , the 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent , two percent of water , and we &apos;re going to fight up with the percentage of the water on the planet , but here &apos;s hope .
and there &apos;s new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation with dean ornish , one of the innovators of the trickster , i want to get permission to you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , &quot; and from the many of you may have heard of you , it has the size of a <unk> in the jungle .
it can generate a thousand gallons of clean water a day from multiple sources -- whether , the saltwater , water , cooks water , dry water , dry adhesive .
the oil of coca-cola has just <unk> <unk> , a huge <unk> of a hundred units of developing countries .
and if all of all , it &apos;s very hopeful , and i &apos;m very confident , coca-cola this technology will be on the planet .
this is <unk> innovation , which is today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in the absence of things .
you &apos;re going to take my god , we soon &apos;t soon find the 70 percent of the <unk> of all of the world &apos;s end .
just think that a <unk> of nairobi , in the middle of kenya , a better than president &apos;s a better than president &apos;s a <unk> clip of 25 years ago .
and if you look at your smartphone , you &apos;re more access to knowledge and information than president years ago .
they live in a world , the information and communication in the abundance , as nobody ever ever realized .
and it &apos;s still better , the things that you have spent the things that you &apos;ve spent , and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and music , technology , technology , technology , technology , technology , and cheaper , and cheaper in your mobile phones .
and the thing thing is , possibly what makes us in the field of health .
last month , i had the pleasure of the <unk> , which means called 10 million criticisms of the familia michoacana of the familia michoacana . &quot;
we &apos;re going to be supported teams around the world , all of these technologies can talk to the device each other each other each other each other , because there &apos;s ai , you can test it with ai , you can test .
and to win , you need to think , has a better diagnosis of <unk> than a team .
imagine this machine . a country where there are no doctors in a developing country where there is no doctors and displaced percent of the health care .
if this device is a <unk> or <unk> alien , who is not known as the default thing and stop an pandemic .
but now , now , now , now , the biggest force that will lead to us .
i call them &quot; the doctor &apos;s &quot; the doctor . &quot;
the whites of the lines are speeding up .
we &apos;ve just got the <unk> .
and just as the way , the biggest <unk> against a is a better upbringing , and the world is a better upbringing and lies in the world .
in 2010 , we had kicked under two billion people online each other .
we &apos;re going to increase the <unk> of two billion points .
three billion new minds , we never heard before , but the global communications was going to be .
what does these people do ?
what do you consume ? what are going to do ?
and instead of settling from the <unk> economic economic history of the history .
these people are armed dollars that are in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be the use of the <unk> , and they &apos;re better through the possibility , and they &apos;re better through the possibility , and they &apos;re better through the possibility , and &quot; <unk> , as much more productive than ever before .
so , what can flourish , healthy , , , , , , , productive members of the <unk> ?
how about it was a sentence new new new new new new new <unk> voices .
how about it , it would be nice , wherever they are , a voice to make a look at the point of wonder and change the first time ?
what are three billion people ?
how about augmenting the <unk> that we can &apos;t predict even predict what we can do ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize , is that little teams , potentially , extraordinary things that are through the passion and focus , extraordinary things that are the ones and governments only could only do that big companies could only do big companies and governments .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that might be already .
it &apos;s a game called the impact .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game that &apos;s a sequence of amino acids can take a sequence of amino acids , as the protein will be developing .
depending on the behavior , we can predict the texture and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so i was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by the <unk> .
and it &apos;s now thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of people who played the game .
and it turns out that today is the human bodies of the proteins better than the best .
and as these people came and and looked at the best <unk> of the world , not a <unk> , no <unk> , a woman , no <unk> , a woman who was a woman , the <unk> counterparts in a <unk> group of a group of <unk> in a <unk> , and the best <unk> <unk> in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , which is the fact that we have more than individuals in our future , is the fact that we have more than individuals today than us to do the most important challenges of our planet .
we have access to the tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds we work with the new challenges we work online online challenges , and to do what causes it is necessary .
we expect a few extraordinary <unk> .
thank you .
i think we need to work something to a <unk> of medical medical civilization .
and i think it &apos;s going to start with a dutch , and i &apos;m going to do .
and maybe i &apos;ve been long enough enough long enough to do that , when i can put it to make this .
before i come to the course of my talk , let &apos;s come back with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the <unk> basin and move us to the world .
we all love baseball , or ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; and and the tendency and the statistics is to use a great deal .
i &apos;m going to tell you about a statistics where i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat are .
that means that the gamers of the gamers of the <unk> is three miles .
this is the ball in the <unk> , the <unk> , he &apos;s not going to be able to stay and who has attempted to a <unk> , it has not been able to be able to do it .
three <unk>
you know how to export a <unk> <unk> baseball <unk> baseball ?
okay , really , maybe , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is somebody who safely four four .
<unk> <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
let &apos;s go back into my world of medicine , where i &apos;m going to take some of a lot of time or maybe a little bit of a little bit less likely to the front of you .
now , imagine you have a <unk> and they &apos;re going to be a <unk> of a <unk> , whose <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in madurai .
somehow , somehow that doesn &apos;t work , or ?
now , imagine you &apos;re going to live in a specific remote area of spring and you have a guy to <unk> <unk> , this resulted to a <unk> , whose <unk> in 200 states .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s this year , and it &apos;s not a look at the wheel .
and they &apos;re an <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do they do for the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse , a latte , a latte , a latte that should be avoided ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one knows no one in the whole of the whole or should be or should be a doctor or a doctor .
what we do is that we &apos;re everybody in them , including me , in the world , with the age .
never , no mistake , no one is wondering about the details of how this is going to be .
and this is the message that i ingest in the medical .
i was an amazing outsourcing student student .
in high school , a few times said that brian would be remembered for a learning .
and so it was also .
and i learned in my little dips in my little <unk> at the toronto , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and the tail every <unk> , every branch of a nurse , which is the aorta of the aorta , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
i knew even knew the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the time i have more aware of more .
and i was good , i closed a closed <unk> .
and i left the relationship with the impression that i knew everything , and all of you know , or at least as much as much as possible , as possible that i was going to be used to be able to be an immune system like that i was going to be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
and it &apos;s got a long time , until i met a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to quote on a <unk> in toronto than a woman , and sent a <unk> <unk> to me in the <unk> of the hospital .
and i was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> service .
and it was my brief brief when the <unk> <unk> advice was <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
and the feedback are <unk> .
i know what &apos;s printer and she was in <unk> .
and when i was teaching her , she was <unk> sound .
and as i was experimenting with the <unk> <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound of two sides , which told me that they were under <unk> .
this is an state of the heart , instead of pumps , instead of the entire blood vessels , instead of a part of the lung , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> ,
and this was not hard to <unk> .
i made it on the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her to take her medicine to take her to the pressure .
i gave you a drug that we call <unk> , water , so that they can escape the liquid .
and over a period of a half hour , they started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i was my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i did two error .
i sent them home , i sent them out with my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t want to hang the way i didn &apos;t want to say , what a call at my <unk> , i got to him what a call at my <unk> , so he would have had an opportunity to make a a really wonder .
and he knew it , he would be able to put additional information .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i wouldn &apos;t be the most ludicrous doctor .
i would like to be able to be able to take so successful , so solving to the distance , and so you could i would be able to help my patients without needing to to help him .
my second error was worse .
i sent them home , i would tell you a quiet voice in me that i tried to say , &quot; don &apos;t make a good idea . not . &quot;
in fact , it really really really really really changed me so much of the nurse that thinks about woman , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking about the and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go to you . &quot;
i remember being remember , as a matter .
so i was going to get the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they brought them home .
and i was able to work backwards .
the rest of the day i had this <unk> sense in my stomach .
but i was working on .
and at the end of the day , i was going to get a hospital , the hospital and went to the back to the car to drive back home when i did something i couldn &apos;t .
i went through the <unk> on my journey home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister &apos;s been born after the woman , but another three words to me and this three words most of the most knowledgeable that i know .
other medical exchange that , but the most effective is quite frankly , because we &apos;re really quite frankly , because we just see the patients just as much as you see .
three words : remember , remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ? remember ?
&quot; remember the patient , you know ? &quot;
roger mountain like this .
so , &quot; so &quot; she said back to this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back back and forth .
and about a hour after she was at home after i was after she was after graduation , and the family was awarded the family took 911 to the <unk> took them back to the blood of 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous accusation .
they were barely and was blue .
the <unk> delta , all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they &apos;re controlling the <unk> .
i was shocked and to the inner <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to do this , because they go back to the <unk> , and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days realized , three days realized that they were never going to be .
she had a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their family .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they &apos;re going to be aware of the <unk> .
the <unk> day they &apos;re going to go to the <unk> , they go -- woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you have the names of the <unk> never forget .
and this was the first time i learned this .
the next few weeks , i learned about this first time , i was kind of interested in our medical culture -- i was just so i was just so i was just so i was just so you can &apos;t talk about the <unk> brain that you can talk to the talk .
you know all the the projections that &apos;s shame when you &apos;re a secret shame when you &apos;re faced with a secret of the best , but my experience has a terrible chance to be the bad force , but the one would also be the bad force , and you make sure that you never do anything .
if you go and and never again .
this is the kind of <unk> .
the unhealthy kind of thing i &apos;m talking about the i think is the that is the dialog .
it &apos;s the one that tells you what you have made is , is it &apos;s bad exploration , but that &apos;s what you &apos;re bad .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t the reason for the <unk> , he was very upset .
he spoke to the family and i &apos;m sure that he was the <unk> and i &apos;m sure that he &apos;s going to be able to chart and i found that i couldn &apos;t .
but i imagined myself , i imagined this questions .
why did i interview the <unk> ? why i want to interview you go home ?
and then in my worst moments , : how could i make a scoring mistake ?
why am i going to be in medicine ?
slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly .
i started feeling better .
and then a <unk> day , and the sun , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke up and i can feel better .
and i looked at me from that if i was going to perfection , i would not become my <unk> and never again , that the voice of the voice .
and they did it .
and i worked .
then it blew up .
two years later , i had service to go into the <unk> hospital hospital in the <unk> hospital hospital in toronto , and i was a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was much fun and i was in love .
he &apos;s always going to go .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> .
two days later , i got to my next <unk> and my <unk> asked me to talk to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : you &apos;re going to get you ?
&quot; remember the patient &apos;s borders with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out that he was a <unk> .
he had an emergent <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can &apos;t argue that , but it &apos;s not a infection of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and causes the majority of the <unk> .
and fortunately , he was not .
he got <unk> <unk> and <unk> a few days later .
and i went back to the same <unk> of leadership and self-doubt , and self-doubt , i felt like a mild and went to the work and went back to the work .
in a high-speed time , i have two occurrences a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of difference there are some sort of a time to make you in a hospital that only had only 14 patients that time only had 14 patients .
in both cases i sent them home and there were no <unk> in your treatment .
at a while i would have been <unk> .
i <unk> the one of the helicopter . when it was a <unk> <unk> , , i had my colleague to the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s land , and called the <unk> .
the other thing had to be dramatic .
i was going to <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and asked my colleagues to <unk> .
and this is what he did , and when he was a <unk> in the right lower , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was good .
both cases <unk> , i &apos;m going to be on the <unk> .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst was just in the first five years , what many of my ministers , but it &apos;s impossible .
and doug happened , the last five years , in the last five years .
alone , and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t just want to talk to my talk to my talk , and you talk about if i &apos;ve taken the silent that , if i tell the quiet voice that i can share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes , so they don &apos;t have the same ?
if i just think about the room -- as well , i don &apos;t have what you think about me .
when did you get the last time you heard about somebody &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> talking about <unk> ?
oh yeah , you &apos;re going to tell you to a cocktail party and you see , you &apos;re going to hear about other things , but you won &apos;t tell someone else about their own mistakes .
if i had to be full of his immediate relationships and to tell you their immediate support and to tell you their immediate support , before i just ask you , i would probably not end the end of the second story , which is very likely to tell you what i was just to tell you that the topic and the rest of the rest .
and indeed , if i knew my colleagues , knew that a <unk> in my hospital , the wrong leg was going to have seven , then i would have to look at my eyes to look at the eyes .
this is the system in the living life .
it &apos;s a completely gratuitous .
it &apos;s a system in the same basic positions of basic positions -- the ones that don &apos;t do any time , and the ones that don &apos;t do that without destroying the <unk> and the <unk> , and the results .
it &apos;s almost a complete response as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as antibodies as
and there &apos;s the idea that if we make the people who are mistakes in medicine that us us a system system .
but there &apos;s two problems that are going to be .
in my about 20 years of medical <unk> and journalism , i &apos;ve been subjected medical journal about medical and journalism , and i was a liberal medical study about medical star , and i &apos;ve been asked medical <unk> <unk> , black elk , black , black elk , black , black elk , black , black elk , black , black elk , black , black elk , black , black elk , black , black elk , black , black elk , black , black elk , black , black elk , black , black elk
and what i learned learned is that mistakes is totally <unk> .
we &apos;re entering a system where every single day , every single day either of a forged <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> , which is always becoming a forged false <unk> or <unk> .
in this state , we &apos;re killing some of these canadians &apos;s <unk> .
in the united states , the institute of medicine for medicine , for the number of 100,000 .
both of those are strong , because we don &apos;t look like we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> investment in the medical of all , all of us all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we cannot get rid of it .
we own cognitive mistakes , so that we can take a perfect diagnostic repository for a patient .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and suddenly the story is being breath , and suddenly the story of the <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t take the same .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always equal .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always always in the same same way .
all the total of the inevitable .
so , if you take the system like i was taught to be taught to be taught and all the <unk> <unk> , then no more left .
and you know the most <unk> people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white , black , black , black , black , black , black , black , black , i would say , &quot; this is my worst <unk> <unk> , say , &quot; well , this is my worst mistakes of the <unk> , &quot; what &apos;s going to be doing ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you with the microphone .
and then your blood , they &apos;re the head of the head , they &apos;re down down and try and make them heavy heavy , and start to tell stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to say to be able to say , &quot; look , not the same error that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need to do is , you &apos;re looking at the position .
what you need need to need a new medical civilization .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new cartoonist , is a human being , and they &apos;re not proud of them to do it , they &apos;re not proud to do something from learning , so that it can be used to be .
they &apos;re happy to others .
they were going to talk about other mistakes .
and they &apos;re others like all of the mistakes , not to mock , but in a sense , and that all of them are capable .
and they &apos;re clinging to a medical culture , the idea that humans are , and if that people live in that , then people can make mistakes .
so , the system evolved to create the <unk> , wiser , <unk> spaces , supporting humans , <unk> spaces , supporting humans , supporting things , <unk> spaces , <unk> spaces , <unk> spaces , <unk> spaces , <unk> spaces , <unk> spaces , <unk> spaces , <unk> spaces like me , the mistakes and the <unk> and for people like me , the mistakes and for the <unk> of this .
my name is brian .
i &apos;m the new shortage of the doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i do .
i &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to learn to learn how to learn about other .
i &apos;m not going to see what you might think of me , but i can live .
let me just end up with three my own words , i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to the time .
the first story is the darwin &apos;s first story of charles darwin , a hero .
you know , he was <unk> .
they may think that he &apos;s <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
it actually collected the fish .
he described a very common from the way . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
and then , in the &apos; 80s , he was in the way style .
now it &apos;s on the red list .
this story is we have a lot of times of the basic or the other places , it &apos;s not very special .
still , we still get the wrong .
we think they &apos;re just the way they &apos;re originally .
the smartest describe they still describe the way than the untouched .
what &apos;s here ?
the second story is another concept , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
because i &apos;ve been known as i started to a lagoon in <unk> .
i went to go there , because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa .
i thought , i think i could do .
and i got a bad <unk> and i was convinced that i was really not about there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you see , it was the lagoon of the <unk> and <unk> from a few of the <unk> .
there was <unk> from about 20 20 pounds , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and fishermen and fishermen and in ghana , in ghana .
when i first went 27 years later , the fish was remembered on half of his size .
they &apos;re like five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still the fish .
people were happy , still .
and the fish also had to be fortunate to be there .
so it has nothing to the point , and yet has changed everything .
my third story told by my <unk> , from my <unk> in southeast asia .
in the 1970s , more than the 1960s -- <unk> europe -- <unk> europe -- <unk> europe .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , which has been expanding a pretty deep ship , the industrial fishing , <unk> lambs , <unk> <unk> .
i went with the and we were walking around the southern <unk> in the south and the most impressed in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we &apos;re going to do .
i know that it &apos;s the most dramatic .
90 percent of our <unk> were keystone , other animals that are linked to the cause of the reason .
the most part of the fish , the little dots there on the pad , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> .
essentially essentially the bottom of the ocean and then <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
within a year , you &apos;re a test , and start with the <unk> .
the reason is transformed . -- in this case -- in this case -- a tough reason or a soft corals .
this is a dead .
they didn &apos;t eat them , you threw them out , because they were dead .
once we started an action .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them .
in fact , this mountain of <unk> , of course , of the fishermen in the fishermen , when they were in areas in which they never been in .
it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember .
we adjust our <unk> , and we don &apos;t even know what there was there .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> , it &apos;s happening .
on the y-axis , some good things : biodiversity , , biodiversity , , you know , the green of your country , the <unk> .
and the time is changing it , it changes because of people are their actions .
each generation of the images that they were beginning to start at the beginning of your mind , as a standard and everything else .
the difference is going to be a loss .
but they don &apos;t even take the previous losses .
it can be a really mean of changes .
and then , just want to get the <unk> .
this is exactly what this is is now is now is now is now .
we want to get things that are gone , or things that are not worth of the way they were .
you could think that the problem is , if you lived in <unk> societies , when they were in <unk> societies , animals and the few generations of consciously , what they did .
because obviously , a animal that has been very often , until rarely , including the rarely <unk> .
you don &apos;t lose a bunch of people .
you lose the <unk> .
and so that &apos;s not as big as big as big as big as it is .
and with the time , we focus on the big animals , and in the ocean , the big fish .
they &apos;re going to kill more because we start sweating .
and over time , little fish , little fish , we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people are .
well , because they didn &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , scientists , they were really different .
they &apos;re going to be able to stay because the evidence , as they &apos;re in a form of godiva , they &apos;re not like they like to pay the length of the time .
there &apos;s a for instance , the report of a <unk> , which was big <unk> , who was big big <unk> , who was not used to be used in this area , not being <unk> , because it &apos;s not called &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in the city societies , because they don &apos;t even dare to live in the past .
this is the enormous role that can play a game .
because because we ask with the cusp of the past , the past .
we &apos;re doing the past , people can &apos;t grasp the people , because they are the <unk> of the <unk> and very low .
so , by that people who sees the people who see the spring and the ones that will be the <unk> .
what &apos;s the people who isn &apos;t possible because they don &apos;t have access to each other -- the people in the midwest ?
so , i can think the art and the film , perhaps the gap , and the film , that simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
there was a long time ago there was a <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remember what they might remember .
if you think about &quot; avatar , if you think , why people were so slow to the people -- besides the moral judgments -- besides the <unk> , why would they do that ?
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s in a sense .
so my god , the only thing i &apos;m going to give you the only person that cameron masterpiece is rotating .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist , <unk> , you had to get a job , you had to draw a job that &apos;s the government .
they also had to be a sheet of <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could be the same .
they found a paper article with <unk> <unk> , they could put the sargassum .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how somebody could do understand how someone could do something , and how much that they would say .
in our own way , we would have never been doing anything .
but if you look at a new type of the leading <unk> , and a page , that page is <unk> on a new type of buy a <unk> , and a page , in a pattern , the page clearly , and your printer will blow .
that &apos;s what happens .
and it &apos;s like no one .
and this was an example of what our own governments technology technology technology technology technology , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens , the citizens
and this is one of the three main theme of the existing fields .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can split the boundary of attacks in the category .
we have three main disposable .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for instance , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> in ukraine .
and the dirty of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these guys deserve money .
they use rovs to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there &apos;s several of the most well-known cases of <unk> , <unk> , the loan you had to learn .
this is <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred hitchcock .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are the critical intellectual materials , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these guys are focused on wealth , and we have illegal to infiltrate money , by the way we grow up from our <unk> , and we also explores it to provoke , to provoke , our <unk> , the our <unk> rates in the input , we have collected over a infected computer online .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> , two months ago , a long ago , and on this , <unk> , <unk> million dollars as it was frozen .
mr. shame is focused on the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s now today today , that we &apos;re victims of a <unk> , as a difference in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only gets worse .
in the future , most of the variation .
the second <unk> we can now watch today , are not able to be able to do it .
they &apos;re through something else -- just like a view , or through your audience .
groups like healthcare and over the last 12 months , and it &apos;s a <unk> on the field of the <unk> .
so these are three <unk> : criminals , the law of the money because of the money because of the money because of the money because the last group of smallpox are the financial services .
there &apos;s the way of <unk> , like the <unk> .
it &apos;s about the question , if governments will be a citizen citizen .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- it &apos;s that .
in the last fall , it was <unk> , because had been hacked .
somebody was , and he had the system of the system was thoroughly .
and last week , i was introduced a helicopter with dutch <unk> , i was one of the group of this group that question was possible for possible that because of the people died .
and his answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yeah . &quot;
now , how do you die in a row ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
now , a certificate , you &apos;re going to take a website with <unk> , with <unk> , for example .
now we use all , or a lot of your productivity , or a lot of you , but these are particularly effective in <unk> states like the iran , especially in <unk> states like , &quot; the neurologic agencies can use more than the local <unk> government can &apos;t be able to live in their own <unk> .
but can you tell if you go to a foreign policy .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , the villagers .
and this is exactly what &apos;s happening in the course of the <unk> .
how does it out with the arab spring , the <unk> , for instance ?
now , in egyptians , the inner in egyptians , the headquarters of the egyptian <unk> , the headquarters <unk> .
in this records , he &apos;s a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , a <unk> <unk> , a few of these had been sold in germany , the study of the study was a few <unk> sold a few of them -- and no communication were able to intercept the egyptian citizens .
they had this program for <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> for the tunisian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so , they serve western governments governments , by <unk> , thereby able against their own citizens .
but western governments are also helping itself .
for example , just a few weeks ago , which was a <unk> officer that was welcomed by german <unk> <unk> , who was welcomed by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ll be able to put your telephone <unk> .
but today , we are far beyond beyond .
she manages the sweat .
you use use how to use the <unk> to allow your computer with a <unk> that allows you to infiltrate your whole communication , to monitor their <unk> , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> .
so , if we think about things , then the obvious answer of people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t really struggle me , because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry about !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this aspiration makes no sense .
privacy must be .
privacy is not to debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments may be like , but every we might be right , but every right we &apos;re going to forever forever .
and we &apos;re trust , we have blind to future , a government that we might have predicted in the ensuing years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 50 years .
it may be weird , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> myth were made of <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : british <unk> , british <unk> , the <unk> .
<unk> was very quickly , very quickly , the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they were able to build things to build things , the bigger we were able to be able to get buildings , bridges .
in essence , the most <unk> was the <unk> of the time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego .
it was called <unk> rock . &quot;
and within a few years , you &apos;re lego in every household in every household .
it &apos;s going to be estimated that about 400 billion rocks , or 75 rocks for each person on this planet .
you don &apos;t need to engineer to engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego for all of the possible .
lego has essentially the <unk> , the <unk> of the world , and it &apos;s a glimpse of our imagination .
in the meanwhile , in the bell , the bell revolution was the next revolution , the next revolution announced the next revolution , the next revolution that came out of the next revolution .
the transistor was a little <unk> , which gives us from the static , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , building blocks and a world in all the way in the smallest .
as the <unk> , the <unk> , allows us to build more greater greater to build more complex , more productive .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t personally , that &apos;s the most fundamental of the time in the subject of experts and so , and so i decided to change that .
and at eight years ago , i was devastated , and i started to study this idea how to study this idea of the engineers in the hands of artists and construction .
i started to developing a few years ago .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are automated , which is a specific feature .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , tone , tone , motor engine and sensor .
and the best thing is that they &apos;re gazing with magnets .
so they can &apos;t be wrong .
the stone are <unk> .
green is is power , blue is power , pink is power is the input and the orange is the orange .
all of all of all , you have to do a blue and a green and you can connect them quickly .
they put a blue restaurant , and they can make light .
you can put a switch between between between between between a little <unk> .
take the returns to the switch , you know , this is , and they have a little baby .
you put this <unk> for a triangle , and they have a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop the .
and over the course of the basic play , is actually quite a very empowering .
instead of creating that you &apos;re programming , or <unk> , unofficial allows you to make a simple nightmare program .
so , to accelerate the scarf , rotate it , it &apos;s just about this button and it makes the teeth faster or slower .
the idea behind the <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing .
we want to put any one of the world in a <unk> stone .
heart , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we have <unk> kids , and they &apos;re going to see them .
and it was an unbelievable experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start the electronics , they start to understand in the everyday , and they don &apos;t learn to school .
like , like a <unk> , or why the aesthetic <unk> , or why the aesthetic <unk> , or like a ipod on the screen .
we &apos;ve also <unk> <unk> .
so we had to designers designers in electronic things in electronic things that started to play with <unk> <unk> .

a couple of weeks ago , we have risd and just gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have had the no technological experience , just the power and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but , wait , this is really my <unk> .
