but the real question is : how do you work this ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a <unk> tag . it &apos;s going to be very effective .
but even more interestingly , the men of study from the study that the men who have developed more tomato sauce , which is the more tomato sauce , they have a cancer .
i once said that albert once said that &quot; discoveries is what everybody has seen , and what has been seen , and think what has seen . &quot;
i &apos;m mortal , <unk> .
it &apos;s fun to do it , unlike a regular problem , which is not quite good enough .
this is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that , but it can &apos;t do it , but on a computer , over the computer , over the computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
in which direction are going to fall ?
so , there are games like &quot; francis &quot; the barrier of the &quot; <unk> &quot; for the <unk> .
looks like a black character . where is that ?
i really believe that a girl , so that &apos;s an emergent that is so tempting to that we had to be able to be able to be able to be .
i remember , as my father , my father , the very violent , very violent , and me .
we &apos;re so much to steal girls , girl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they were designed to objects .
and she looked at the eyes of her baby and said , &quot; i couldn &apos;t love my baby . i couldn &apos;t love my baby ?

it &apos;s not really knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i was in the jungle , i would spend long as a long time , because it &apos;s very practical , and they &apos;re very cheap .
right now , right , and gives strings .

the bad news is .
instead of forced to defend your relatives or <unk> , they &apos;re extinct .
today , <unk> evolution in a hundred thousand countries , and then redistributed to the <unk> command .
the fear is biking . &quot;
we put a few rules , and we &apos;re stuck on them .
the conversation is better than walking . &quot;
just as i was caricaturing today to come here , i started to come here , started to come up here , started a my daughters .
and we developed 10 .
i was a teenager , when i was a teenager , when i was anna <unk> <unk> , &quot; anna families , all of the lucky family , same each other .
i want to show you how something can be pretty much as well as well as it can .
so if i look at this , you see a <unk> <unk> , and this is the <unk> , you see a <unk> <unk> , the water expands by the ministry of the utterances .
and plato with all the boys &apos; 70s in his country . sweeney : shape-shifting ...
i &apos;ll show you .
but yet , the success was not about .
one thing that i want to say is that they &apos;re not chasing the actual <unk> .
we can peel them or or <unk> , or a bulldozer .
it &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can use it in the tail of depression .
we &apos;re undoing to grasp what circuits is that circuits are the circuitry and the <unk> of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the symptoms of the clinical trials and the
evolution is working more like a <unk> than a engineer .
that &apos;s enough .
what we discovered is we discovered is , if you look at the staircase or a crab , the relative <unk> or a crab , the relative <unk> of this feather is equal to the feather that is the relative animal <unk> of this feather is equal to the right .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s incredibly difficult to say , and they couldn &apos;t tell you .
he &apos;s making this with a <unk> glue .
what we do is we take the hair , and they &apos;re doing with another colleagues , and they &apos;re related to another operating room .
and then , in fact , from the <unk> <unk> , shareholder <unk> , two thirds of the most often men have only one-third two-thirds of the women women .
i was san francisco , san francisco , my <unk> , my <unk> , and then the <unk> .
and we go out , look at the end , and say , &quot; how do you get ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard business school , a woman named heidi .
and i &apos;ve been rebuilt my hand axes and i realize that time and i realize that all of questions have you wonder more questions about men , just like men . &quot;
a woman &apos;s contacted me and i looked at them -- she saw a little bit .
thank you .
they &apos;re not going to do that , you should do it .
so not fear was the <unk> area .
but it &apos;s true in the black .
i want to talk about this , talk about how we spread in this country , we spread in this country , like we are going to spread the information .
so they are in <unk> , <unk> , and that &apos;s works .
we &apos;ll tell you that everything fine is ; it &apos;s going to be .
this patient is the 50 , we can &apos;t say quite precisely exactly what is pretty accurate , on the prostate cancer .

and if you talk about nature , the world is my job , how does the idea of the <unk> ?
all right , we are all of the raw .
the only thing here is the cheap <unk> : really new , the new , the new , even i could try to make a <unk> of 10 to 10 miles in 15 minutes .
if a a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s going to be the grass of this <unk> , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening something interesting thing .
and now i &apos;m saying i &apos;m saying i &apos;m saying i want to build a layer of games at the most , but that &apos;s not true , because it &apos;s already happening in the development ; it &apos;s happening .
if not , it &apos;s not , the is the pity . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come to a certain time , you get your highest highest in the developing price .
and then they can achieve the different ways to do good .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a barrier , trying to find the best news that tries to find the stories .
we have the last time in a few years ago .
you also see , when i &apos;m going to show you this -- hopefully i don &apos;t have the world .
you can see , here &apos;s what it started .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> , who would have been teaching <unk> students should be teaching the law of the <unk> , just as a hobby .
and raise your hands .
it makes it to a place where it makes fun .
and so , the thing is that we work , and we &apos;ve even have people who are excited about the people who are excited about the people that &apos;s really your goal .
thank you .
what brunel , as he said , for his passengers , was the experience , who was able to stand through the landscape .
what does life mean , what does life mean , enjoyable ?
so , the part of the <unk> you &apos;re going to build this , instead of building a great new facility , the one of the girls of a hospitals &apos; court &apos; hospitals earlier .
today , the industrial systems of the time is <unk> and the majority of the present problem .
and as brunel , we can do that , by systems , a bigger effect .
and from my persistence , <unk> <unk> the waiter of his <unk> .
jay chiat and i have a series of studies , right now , exactly this question .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american impact is demands .
but for the <unk> , the serbian of all these <unk> on the marketplace like a <unk> .
the americans themselves , suggesting that , the theory seem to be in practice in practice .
<unk> parents would be more like things like , &quot; noah was just for just a short time , but he &apos;s got so much .
robert frost once once once once , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that you go . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant <unk> of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one : they &apos;re <unk> problems that are being controlled .
so thank you very much .
it &apos;s called competition .
and then we build a <unk> that we can do the <unk> performance of machines , and we can do it , and we can really become very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the best <unk> best understood is not as a <unk> , but as a <unk> movement .
the bomb enters the stage .
and then the <unk> of the nuclear power that the energy , the rest of the rest of the los angeles .
you can see it and it &apos;s on the screen , and it &apos;s just a little bit about the outside and flow of the inside of the outside , right now .
if you ask the word or the principle of the principle , it &apos;s very really true that his attitude is very much , and we &apos;re missing .
i think it was that exchange to test the test .
ph : i hope you &apos;ll find out how to this is .
and then the race has to be the future , as the u.s.
mm : because it was a role for a reason to do something .
they produce things like 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and what television tells what &apos;s going on , is a very exciting new way of communication , and we &apos;ve got the <unk> of two , and we &apos;ve got the <unk> of two , and a new way to see it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can &apos;t be <unk> to the simple : if i go through new york , i think .
it has given me to the other , maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk about us and build a few installations .
the ones that the city for public space , the day , is substantially , is substantially a global problem .
even the response is french . french . french .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls . &quot;
and this was it , like i was looking for some <unk> and <unk> , with design , when the design of the chair that i &apos;m going to show you .
he said , they have one of the new self-assembling , better .
or they pull them up in the world .
i knew from experience and when i was in the offices where there was <unk> with <unk> , where there was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to turn them in the position .
and then we &apos;ve seen it in droplets .
two days ago , i couldn &apos;t remember why <unk> was the first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was the first <unk> <unk> <unk> , about 52 knots , about 52 knots , with the <unk> cases .
we need something that the most <unk> is really <unk> , so that it doesn &apos;t generate the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : male , every lot of the tree .
so mendel are not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why ? &quot;
and most of the time i was explaining i couldn &apos;t even know , i even though i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
look at the time , the chinese data .
now , our mobile can create a story of our <unk> of the <unk> .
bill <unk> : your health depends on their health care
this is my grandfather .
that &apos;s been reason for the simple reason that no one word .
like , like , <unk> , <unk> , water from the ground .
this is the title of a remarkable backyard from a wrist of a <unk> of &quot; nature &quot; the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
80 percent of them are lost as lost as mentioned .
and instead of 100 percent , we have a sample percent .
we have a functioning technology , and a that will be applied to <unk> , which we &apos;re going to do in the world &apos;s largest <unk> of the world .
and he was a <unk> <unk> : he &apos;s all <unk> and mutations to look at the rules and laws to look at norms .
and in this example , they &apos;re looking at the individual levels of capital , but they &apos;re going to be without <unk> .
and as an architect , i think about relationships between the relationship between the and the whole thing , but in fact , more than business .
we &apos;re focused on the level of the building , where we could build the five separate bomb , where we could build the five separate behaviors , but they should all the <unk> to a single <unk> of a single <unk> .
we come back back to a few years later , 2003 , 2003 , 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is looking for the <unk> look forward .
the difference is especially in <unk> in <unk> in the desert , or maybe <unk> , whatever they want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that are illegally and now on the air .
we have the amount of nitrogen and the world in the world , just by the sounds , the huge issues in rivers , lakes , huge amounts of embodied problems in rivers , lakes , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for self-reflection .
but we can modify this and there &apos;s opportunities .
<unk> is the largest <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
need to work together .
so , what &apos;s technically that that &apos;s technically that ?
we want to see our products in the shop . &quot;
this is the entire system never designed .
we &apos;ll interact with our world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological instances to enhance this <unk> -- muscles .
this is what happens .
here we are , or cut the nerve , or cut the nerve , from small , we gave us the nerve free , from small other bodies , the us that we &apos;re going to have the hand -- two other others that we gave our hand -- signal .
ak : it works .
but i can &apos;t grasp any electrode in a very electrode , and say , &quot; there &apos;s a . &quot;
and this is our goal -- something involves clinically clinically clinically input .
this is jesse and he &apos;s got a <unk> .
thank you very much .
sub-saharan , these large basic partners , there &apos;s 22 basic basic life , which are millions of millions of millions of people who are infected .
governments are <unk> <unk> <unk> for ethical health care of clinical trials in clinical trials , which are in clinical trials , which are from the government and the <unk> of the study and the <unk> of the study .
the fundamental problems we are confronted to be aware of a microphone and to many people .
so they &apos;re all the criteria that the people normally inhabit .
so you see this current , the <unk> , north -- the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the the the the the the <unk> , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
we know , not just <unk> , they &apos;re restricted and other <unk> .
i want to show you that penguins are being penetrated in the <unk> .
before <unk> , the <unk> , with his <unk> , with his <unk> , we &apos;re going to go back and forth .
and then there &apos;s another one of the favorites that &apos;s called the dwarf <unk> .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t have our fundamental political .
and the two share is a pretty long time .
again , again , again , again , china don &apos;t have conquered russia . it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
for china , patent holders , so that <unk> and <unk> and <unk> their weapons is searchable and <unk> their weapons and <unk> china .
what i want to show you here is , i &apos;ll call <unk> , i call day day .
these two leading interactions are graduating to a sponge , a traditional infrastructure , the west bank bombings that binds the west bank with the gaza .
one of them .
so what does next ? how does the future of the european union ?
the middle countries , in the way , in fact , most of the suspects look the helpful straight lines .
this dream is supposed to be .
does it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone receptor growth growth .
so , how can the speed of the brain &apos;s speed of the brain ?
we think insulin and igf-1 hormones are in good times , which is the <unk> popular in -- in good times -- in good times -- when food is present , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details of how it works , but we know that foxo will be an impact of people .
in fact , you could have genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of the process of the process of the process that i &apos;ve been talking about the process of a <unk> <unk> , another example , so that the bird of life can live .
you never get a proper <unk> because they want to buy their shoes .
they all have heroes that were <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to walk into a <unk> .
this view is <unk> , that many of the funders are given prozac like prozac , the chemistry of the brain , as if in the brain of an chemical soup .
and my <unk> colleague <unk> <unk> .
by the <unk> , we found that a dollar , a lot of longer , and when we put the gene , to look forward , after the <unk> , the in this mutation , the in this mutation , we could explore a <unk> .
so , this question has been asked for a long time , but we can actually test it .
so , i like , &quot; , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
just so you see it , that &apos;s the cheese .
people told me they told me , they &apos;re going to be now about mosquitos .
in <unk> .
and each time i felt the <unk> of the eyes of the pioneer of the prisoner behind me .
and as <unk> , is fat one of the best sources of adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells . adult stem cells
so as we speak , we &apos;re about <unk> clinical trials of the use of stem research for <unk> .
we &apos;re very happy , because we &apos;ve got to have the opportunity to have this angels in our country , not just in our country : venezuela .
so what happens when that happens ? what happens ?
but here &apos;s what really is .
i can &apos;t tell you more because i &apos;ve got to learn about the headline .
<unk> <unk> : what they don &apos;t know about marriage
but how do you know ?
it &apos;s going to be better , and it seems to make sure that we can make this receiver , that in the dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s going to be precise his body out , but they can &apos;t really get the fly , because the fly between two <unk> .
for a smart creature , like our fly , isn &apos;t just in stone , but it &apos;s going to change the animal waste through experience .
by many experiments we were experiments we were able to be able to regenerate the identity of the antarctic <unk> to 12 cells .
there &apos;s some ideas ideas in the <unk> and the artificial intelligence , as you could do that , but we don &apos;t always have an inclusive example of physical behavior , how powerful behavior from physical interactions of physical interactions .
here &apos;s the same thing , or actually a <unk> of the .
ed : i &apos;m sure : okay . : okay . a little bit of the country , a little bit more .
i know that hospitals know that hospitals for young people , a very sad place for young people .
this is a picture of my favorite <unk> of my <unk> &apos;s sake .
and one of them , this kind of <unk> that is all of the <unk> , of their peers , from their ability to the <unk> that we see in our lifetime in health care .
they weren &apos;t like a <unk> like a <unk> or the glue .
here we have the robot .
marc <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you &apos;re going to the <unk> and it would be a <unk> , or we would shake the leaf ? &quot;
and so , <unk> , and he &apos;s doing this .
of course , as you see , when you see this in a <unk> .
we &apos;ll look at the evolution of the rising .
and i would say , the people who are working on the oceans and the goals , we &apos;re going to think about it , we &apos;re going to be much lower .
this is the boat i was the last three months ago .
if this ice melts , rises seven meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the corals of the galapagos .
you &apos;re the <unk> .
but then , at the end , the <unk> is the <unk> in black .
we &apos;ve been very curious about the maldives of years , we &apos;ve always made with <unk> , but in this case , we go back 20 million years .
and this is the job that &apos;s einstein : how the gravity works is .
einstein had to space and time , and then and curves to describe the gravity .
but deep in the structure of space , so the idea that could be more dimensions than we should see there .
and as as as the strings can vibrate in a different way , can predict the other threads in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just really interesting mathematical mathematical construction , maybe , maybe , maybe some of <unk> properties of the world , or can we actually heal this extra dimensions ?
so we have two decks with colored brown .
now , can see that predator is that what is that is that it &apos;s going to be ?
and what &apos;s true information is irrational , which is able to adjust for all information .
and we look at about 30 seconds , what a is a a little hammer , in a 18 minutes , a little bit of a <unk> in a very 18 minutes .
why ? because when the <unk> and the same amount of light on light on the eye outside her eye , the same amount of the <unk> outside the shadow , they would have to reflect up , they just kept a little bit closer to the laws of physics .
how do you know that ?
and you get into the hive , 62 <unk> and <unk> -- and this is honey .
it &apos;s about him . it &apos;s like , &quot; yeah ?
do you ever come ? ?
often there &apos;s no right or wrong .
in 2010 , not so much .
we are also a species of storytellers .
now some of things : understanding of safety , the risks that are the threats of the <unk> , as they work .
but in a modern world , you need to take care of the many of the world that we &apos;re communicating with .
think about cancer , avian , swine flu , sars .
there was no new insights , but less afraid .
and there &apos;s another more cognitive lesson : i call it <unk> to accept data , by measuring the our <unk> , and data , the data that we &apos;re going to be loyal to our <unk> .
i was able to determine whether my airplane was definitely to fly up to fly .
this is the most popular people .
and he was sitting here in the morning , in stanford .
they had good minds with their teachers and students .
let me show you some questions about finding out what that is the good choice . &quot;
i took them to get a person to get a person , you get a person , you couldn &apos;t vote , but i found that no one was something .
we have the first fully 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky .
and groups often often immediately , often instantly . &quot;
you need a <unk> process , which is very complicated with the core of this very complicated society , which is the very complicated society .
it &apos;s about that we &apos;re probably the first time in the history of arab world , a revolution in the history of the ground , and see , a <unk> .
and the paradox is that the <unk> was so promising , and it &apos;s from a side .
on just the ngos , the ngos of their ancestors couldn &apos;t just get on the streets -- but they took them into the previous , because they were the victims of these arms <unk> .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think , &quot; <unk> , something is good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little bit crazy , to work on a new toolbox .
and i try to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange <unk> man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big advance . &quot;
and the last day , the sun began to the sun , the <unk> , they come right , it &apos;s fantastic .
i admit i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit nervous , because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things , about how we should tell you a few radical mechanisms about cancer , a lot more than i do that .
the part of the genome is that we can read , is the list of the .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in the genetics , by just by the genetic resemblance .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; okay . at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least one guy . &quot;
so we measure every <unk> as a a own .
if you have malaria , we give them <unk> , or some of the things that are .
where we really need to learn to be able to do , is the process that is just right on the <unk> activities of the <unk> activities of the &apos; s activities on the level of the &apos; why , how does it be honest , how does it be ? &quot;
danny hillis : cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer .
they &apos;re all members in tribes .
it &apos;s not just the people that just flame .
because stage three three three , most of us .
this is the lobby .
there was no plan . there &apos;s no idea before that .
in fact , martin luther king <unk> <unk> , the glasgow three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair and repetition . &quot;
and suddenly , they &apos;re the <unk> out and tried to figure out , and figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of the local ? &quot;
automatically <unk> , we <unk> that little cage .
these are <unk> <unk> , who were designed by the way to get much more efficient to the ground for the ground , they &apos;re facing taxes , on the ground , they were not as a basketball building .
they <unk> the stability and security , the lap of a failure , comparing the lap of a uncle , comparing a <unk> seal in the .
but from my perspective , compassion has compassion is compassion .
and it &apos;s the <unk> form of <unk> .
i can &apos;t explain it , and not .
stories like this , like these , practical data in a world that &apos;s been able to bring compassion in a world that defines the <unk> images of suffering that could tell us .
i was also a really <unk> man .
and the first day we took our <unk> and our slogan that we we we we we have now to be able to instill every day for the rest of the summer and the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of their greatest .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group without <unk> , without subsidy to mimic the other .
so this is the world where we live today .
and so i try to learn from the example of my journey .
okay , number two : they &apos;re going to be able to do in the wild .
and imagine this , they &apos;re an image picture : i was in mexico , in mexico , , unfortunately , in mexico , , unfortunately , very <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we think that through all the changes that are happening that &apos;s happening that we &apos;re going to make opportunities opportunities .
it &apos;s an initiative that is simple , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
we &apos;ve got 30 different savings in other countries in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people in the way to learn from people to learn what this particular path is determined .
and on my bedroom came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember you , i remember , i remember , i remember that each generation has to be better than the .
i know a lot of people who are very smart puppy , and yet , &quot; why can &apos;t solve my problem ? &quot;
i started with her last day with another family .
do you think we have the responsibility to take the public seriously ? &quot;
i &apos;ll be elected at four years of old ford as a as before .
but this is not a good life .
this is what he got to note .
whether you believe or not , not , not , not , not to have any difference .
so he said , &quot; what do you get into your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s the no-brainer ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a denial , and this is a doctor , and this is the impression that what they &apos;re .
when my kids were , i went to her room , i sat down in her room , put me on her bed , and i was to sleep my kids .
it &apos;s less than i had a <unk> -- i &apos;ll go back to three million of 10 million million dollars -- but it &apos;s a very significant way .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , each containing a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly was suddenly just 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese chinese character for the <unk> .
they answer the question : how does it feel that you &apos;re going to do ?
we really learn that really bad lesson .
think for a moment , how it &apos;s really to feel in right .
and unlike different animals , we are obsessed with them obsessed , trying to figure out it .
and i must tell you that i &apos;ve been talking about this incredible <unk> book , a subject that all sailors hate , for a audience that never would never give it .
the effect of course not only <unk> <unk> wheat , but mountains of a grain of <unk> .
1986 came from vietnam to america .
the answer was <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s not even worse . &quot;
our <unk> blood pressure on a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom , we have focused on our <unk> .
and bhutan , for the that you don &apos;t know , the youngest democracy is the world , first of two years .
it &apos;s actually so much that we often were often in the west often , as if that we were lucky something that we would have to be able to get some of the things that we &apos;re getting .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn to learn to really need to reduce the production of the production , by measuring the right conditions that our employees can live their lives .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
underneath underneath your ears , you know , the sinaloa federation , you &apos;re going to you , you &apos;re going to give you , but the eyes is , &quot; i &apos;m quiet . &quot;
amy , &quot; you know , &quot; you get the up ?
the method : what did you do ? what did you do ?
i just read a number .
real science literacy , the people who are going to give people a voice and they &apos;re doing to express this , and this last word in this short history .
poor people have this choice of choice .
we were introduced in the 1970s .
and to get there , we need to recognize that the only thing you couldn &apos;t just the way that we &apos;ve talked about , but our society is the way we &apos;ve spoken about that we &apos;ve spoken about that , but also our society is <unk> .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve already asked , &quot; yeah , great things like , on top , but how do i get there ?
i was a professor of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the rest of it was doing this back to finance the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
you &apos;ll just fall apart , you &apos;re going to end .
i mean , people are certainly available .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. es : the <unk> mobile <unk> : the <unk> mobile phone .
and for those who can &apos;t read , it appears like , &quot; it seems like , as if it &apos;s actually a kind of technology technology . &quot;
green or dubai <unk> , where not <unk> , are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , <unk> , who &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
i learned who he was really really .
i invite up to an vitamin .
i say , &quot; hold your life when you can . &quot;
even even the <unk> paper in our hands , we have redefined new .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly , he knows it was defeated .
to give you this , we have to put back back on the driver .
we we we we we &apos;re going to we we sent the field , we sent the buildings of conduct that we could put the buildings of the inside , the <unk> , and the rescue .
if i do this , i don &apos;t use the original speed of the contrary , i could write here story .
you &apos;re going to be from the public opinion .
this is not good good .
and this is a democracy &apos;s democracy .
here &apos;s the question : blogging cut off , china or india , china or india ?
because the indian man has emerged in a different man of two years old , a benefit of two years old of two years old .
what political change is , they &apos;ve got <unk> .
china , so i think , has still some of the evolutionary barrier , <unk> -- especially in social capital , public health , public health , health , a sense of equality , which is not available .
it was a place where people are experimenting with <unk> and <unk> with different <unk> and <unk> .
and now they have the problem that they spent the entire money to afford help to afford help to afford help to afford help to afford all the <unk> .
one of the procedures , a little bit more , where people are rather interesting ideas where people are more interesting ideas -- people people .
about about a or two decades ago , a wonderful <unk> <unk> with the speed of the pacific and <unk> parallel to this period .
they were <unk> , their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it .
is that the other ?
in the 1970s , the one percent is the percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political <unk> can be in the category &quot; <unk> , &quot; and political , the group of good genes can help , but nothing good for the rest of us .
as you just just right right , how globalization and technological revolution , these global power of the money , it &apos;s much harder to be much harder to the entire world .
they don &apos;t take upgrades of time and the privilege to announce your children .
we have charles <unk> .
this is his little hand .
one of them will die .
this was a huge wine for us , because we had to redesign a new development .
i think i even think that in places like oregon , where you take a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a toxic dose , only half percent reduction ever done .
so long , long speech , it &apos;s got to canada .
but i also heard about cancer as the most sophisticated disease of our time , how do they get the good and the bad metric ?
some articles went to say some articles even more <unk> against cancer , not just against cancer , not just against cancer , but it &apos;s about that , but it &apos;s the metastases that are metastases .
there &apos;s been 16 percent , but only 16 percent of the <unk> bean metastases , but only 16 percent of the actual tumors producer in skeletal muscle , able to controlling angiogenesis to controlling angiogenesis , which polluted these blood vessels .
this is a very far error idea , but i really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really believe that that possible .
and then my translator left me .
she was the girl that was going to be <unk> the other .
and then i wrote a to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , the one 11 , georgia , the one took a 11 son .
&quot; what did he did say ? &quot; i said , my my father &apos;s my translator .
so the two would come to lunch , and we were getting out of the restaurant .
he had kids from korea , and he found that life , and he found that families .
they &apos;ve got a lot of time about the current <unk> .
so i do that window , look out , look , look , look , and see , like , &quot; and see how is the hotel of hotels .
so we started to go into the bath , took our faces and the test of our children .
by far as the adoption , a year ! what does it take this long ?
this is your <unk> .
this is sydney , who is going to be a few days later in a few days .
but there was no evidence evidence .
there are little planets , there are bigger planets , there &apos;s a big planet , ok .
but there &apos;s still a lot more more .
so , the question is : is this chemical phenomena , or it &apos;s something that stretches off the planet ?
and this is <unk> <unk> , meaning , is that the science is that the science is that the science is , as we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the observable universe , with all the stars , with all the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
look at : while uganda <unk> and zimbabwe <unk> , russia on a percent .
you find the highest hiv in africa , and yet , they find in africa in the african countries , and yet , there &apos;s the same size as the same rate as the same size as the united states .
look at the dark .
it might be that there might be something else , that &apos;s the most frequent .
we know , about 350 billion people have ever lived .
this was not just a economic story .
and the result is even more than it &apos;s even greater than it in germany .
so , as it &apos;s done .
you just give me . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end with three questions , in the future , for example , for example , when the united states than the number one .
no , we &apos;ll be able to be able to come up , despite the <unk> , we &apos;ve been studying the ethic , we explore our accountable and other parts of our historical research .
niall , thank you .
there are lots of applications .
spider &apos;s completely inherently entirely .
the threads that are being a single spider , are quite diverse .
also , <unk> is a very idea where the <unk> .
what i want to do is not the <unk> , so precise , so , so they &apos;re also designed , but it &apos;s going to be able to look at the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
that sounds in our ears , but what &apos;s happening is that 80 percent of the <unk> <unk> has contributed a lot of the same <unk> of the same <unk> .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem with a problem , is that the first goal of the institution is always being used to the .
the inventor of knowledge don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there &apos;s people in the states , the <unk> are trying to find whether or not .
it &apos;s created by the <unk> , by the use of many of these devices , the highlight of these tools , the world &apos;s independent , for the last week for the last week .
you have <unk> , which is probably for us to the most violent part of the bread , or the threads , because it &apos;s just acceptable <unk> out of the fibers , because privacy is organic .
everything &apos;s on his place . first .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the <unk> of a global plane -- my search , under the <unk> of a global plane -- my favorite word to the question &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
this is a transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re on the ground , they go back to jail , they &apos;re alive and character .
if you do this bread , they can collect any kind of expansion of a <unk> in every beer .
it &apos;s going to be a kind of <unk> , as we work through this talk .
it &apos;s very much , this scores , this scores , this scores , and at the time i work on a piece of play , the most extreme sides of my life and i would have liked the hair .
it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , the extraordinary artists .
that gives you a little <unk> of the .
what we did -- &quot; betty <unk> , a surgeon , and i -- we gave the babies two two two two two two two , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> .
i mean , in the last time , if we look at the user , if we look at the user , they appear quite useless .
and our babies and our babies and kids are much longer than the babies of any other species .
the <unk> <unk> is to change the hypothesis .
now , there &apos;s two things that are really interesting about .
boy : yeah .
our consciousness is extremely light and the , and everything else is going to be like dark .
&quot; babies and little kids are like the research and <unk> of human species , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . your brain processes and decisions .
if i take you for a little demonstration of a demonstration of a demonstration , i could show you quite trivial .
then they repeatedly this process and over again , until something back to something , until something forbidding , as i was walking , as i was walking .
what really wanted to really wanted to do the entire human body .
nothing can &apos;t do anything .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes , how he got it .
i &apos;m not sure sure why , but we did it yet .
some of the studios use our software to do this , and we &apos;ll soon find a few of us to see a few of our <unk> into a few big <unk> .
we thought he just couldn &apos;t keep the balance .
here &apos;s what you learn to get to the <unk> -- how most of you .
but i must say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened 13 years old .
i &apos;m confident confident that art and creativity is developing , and we are developing .
if you &apos;re lonely lonely lonely , you may have a new york times , they get hundreds of thousands of crap , and most of frustration today , <unk> .
some stories are just like , and yet they &apos;re not .
it &apos;s called <unk> . no one has ever bought .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to do , what &apos;s the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you &apos;re a new , , selfish document of the way that could do .
i think there &apos;s actually two main <unk> .
the other products were introduced with a surgery standard , instead of <unk> <unk> .
and if someone &apos;s a <unk> -- which i had posted facebook -- i say , &quot; i can . &quot;
but when i looked at the <unk> technology , nanotechnology , <unk> and other other minds technologies in the <unk> species , i made a big difference over the <unk> .
and to talk to the danger of these new things , we need to move the ability to the ability to use the individuals that they basically have access to counsel .
i think the challenge that we &apos;re facing -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to be the challenge -- the challenge is that we &apos;re going to be the <unk> with the background , which is the tendency to us to the same time ?
and if you take an three-dimensional structure , for example , they have all kinds of incredible research .
and to give you a glimpse of tiny <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s going to get to 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s so for us .
and if you raise the concept of the <unk> , you can &apos;t raise a much more subtle , the use of market -- to deliver feedback .
and 12 years ago , i began to be the <unk> and i was going to go into this direction .
wonderful things like this .
there &apos;s ice below this surface .
so they &apos;re an <unk> puppet .
it &apos;s actually so much energy for biology in this characters that &apos;s actually a big number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we found out a few years ago , suddenly many of the people have been doing and other organisms than all of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest
so if you <unk> a goal of <unk> , you need to attach some steps , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> , some of the
and so , it &apos;s also a archimedes , the big greek .
due to afghanistan , and it was about the actual cancer .
this means before we start to digitize the <unk> , we had to take the book .
and this is what the way .
but by the electrons with light , flies flies , they give them off .
this was an bad idea , because vitamin had a son named <unk> was the passenger pigeon , and they lost the battle of the <unk> .
because in the moment , the data is spinning with <unk> and <unk> .
the original owners was one of the most <unk> <unk> of most uplifting <unk> of the 18th century .
i wondered : i was 160 dollars for this ?
she has four balconies .
a <unk> schematic is that many of these things are going to be used to be able to stop it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet toilet .
there was a object that i couldn &apos;t get into the fingers , and that was the <unk> cheval blanc .
and i cannot mention -- call my taste of a <unk> -- so it &apos;s not necessarily substantially that i couldn &apos;t just hold to be impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one , with this reaction .
and at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid made a a virtual impact of a sudden from a virtual impact of a sudden that <unk> dollars sold .
the really interesting really interesting really interesting really interesting really interesting thing is that you can measure .
well , i could end up a game called the name of the name system , by drilling , or a thousand pies .
if there are real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok , then . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and <unk> is in there .
and i want to tell you a quick story , so we had developed this 1999 called a video called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how simple engagement can be transformed by the psychological engagement , and we can get to the neurological , we can monitor people .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> officially is the <unk> .
i &apos;m fantastic , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with the diet .
there &apos;s definitely every case in america , 49 million people and almost 1.9 <unk> million children .
and they also see their jobs are also big .
it &apos;s the investment of <unk> <unk> crops and the big <unk> of the big <unk> basin , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the way we &apos;re in america in america and the change , as we &apos;ve got to be an agriculture .
this is a <unk> that i &apos;ve been two years ago , which was was was was was was was in the most exciting projects i was nervous .
but i &apos;m going to illustrate it on the beginning of the process , on three very <unk> .
if we &apos;re good , what we should do , we should be able to create a architectural manifestation of a architectural impact through the <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
the architectural <unk> , <unk> said , &quot; simple .
and this is the actual pirate of the .
the second technology we &apos;re we &apos;re doing is we use things that you &apos;re from the opera of a opera .
here you see the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how you cultivate stories about something .
one of this projects is about a year .
these are the pictures that automatically creates automatically .
as i was awake , i had the camera around the front door .
you can see a timeline that tells you the <unk> moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . you know , etc .
a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer farmer .
what if you were just a single year , what would you found was what would you do about the next 35 years ?
&quot; money is &quot; and a business , &quot; and a business .
as the san francisco he had said that he wanted to be , and he had to be a about a <unk> relationship with a kind of <unk> .
don &apos;t understand me , writing , writing .
and with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible to <unk> , except in madurai , and then it &apos;s the communication .
very funny people , if lol is shared .
you &apos;re not fighting .
if somebody came from a black hole for 1993 , the <unk> of a superior has been a little bit different for the time of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and , &quot; what was going on .
i &apos;m about the <unk> , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , if you &apos;re in new york , you can see my work at the whitney , and also in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
afghanistan doesn &apos;t have existential existential threat for the global safety .
and the same thing is true for the troops .
instead , there &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> optimism .
diplomats <unk> is fertile in <unk>
and then finally we need to understand that the secret of what we learned in bosnia and kosovo in kosovo , the kosovo , the secret of our own personal part of our lives -- in the midst of our transportation .
rory , they &apos;re all the way back to the .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you how it looks like .
there are also <unk> , the <unk> , but if you &apos;re these <unk> <unk> , they &apos;ll use these things like a different kind of <unk> .
the <unk> . this is a very hard problem for reasons that i don &apos;t get <unk> .
there &apos;s another , very interesting , very interesting , very interesting , and this is that what you want to do is valuable information about a really bad .
so , i think it has given the minimal food that we can do , which can probably do something .
and we decided that we don &apos;t think about that , so much should think about the cost of the cost of thinking , but in the course of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book , that means , &quot; what is the tempest of god ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t have a lot of people who are not as as you are .
so we can think about things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m just going to talk about , but only if i say that you &apos;re going to tell you about a ship , without previous <unk> , without previous <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
then bell bell his students .
within a couple of years , in the late 19th century , century , suddenly the doctor was trying to provide a diagnosis , a diagnosis of the <unk> .
between perception and the physicians in the doctors and the physicians in the middle ages , the most medical care is a real .
i also experience another experience that i had to stanford before i was going to stanford , i was influenced me .
the bad news : the other we don &apos;t know about it , you see ? that &apos;s what we can do . &quot;
i remember so many big hurdles , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who &apos;s going to be the ritual .
some of some of some of us , &quot; <unk> , a more <unk> .
in this case , we have the power .
for you , for you , there &apos;s a miracle ! &quot;
and there was no <unk> .
religious <unk> .
more difficult to move the dead crisis .
my friend simon was established , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , wrote the book , wrote the book .
and now they open your eyes .
you can open up fully obvious , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it &apos;s me to think about the final thing that these guys , most of what they do for their living .
everybody remembered that impossible .
you can create a lot of change , and you can build it in the streets .
and this is something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need everybody .
<unk> <unk> has <unk> <unk> and middle in venezuela , he had just got it .
and so that &apos;s always going to continue .
they connect people .
the reason that the modern modern medicine has been used a 60 years .
there &apos;s a catch .
this is how it &apos;s been used to <unk> faster , <unk> more and more time than our current <unk> for pancreatic cancer .
and i experiences my experiences with the most vulnerable world .
there &apos;s a long time that the character .
and why not leads to babies and why do we mean babies in relationships ?
because in fact , it &apos;s the secret of the .
all right , especially important important to this description of others or my self -- this is the same -- interesting interesting is that there &apos;s no <unk> .
this is your <unk> and <unk> , which is biology , that &apos;s biology , the natural instinct .
and then there &apos;s a way that desire curiosity curiosity , <unk> .
you know , there &apos;s a daily space that everyone alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
this is where most rooms , in smaller rooms .
so , early coastal some <unk> some places like some places .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , these tools that we are ?
thank you very much .
and then he was sitting on me and said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to me .
how do we fix the following three problems that i want to talk about this ?
albert einstein -- i was busy with somebody else , when i was in princeton , and i was mr. einstein .
what &apos;s in life ? consciousness , what am i here ?
i &apos;m reading a talk or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
one french historian : rarely said two centuries later , &quot; rare has a <unk> spirit of such as gripping as distinct as high quality of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he went .
i &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> of the <unk> .
but for you to have about 10 minutes , and a woman in the arm , which is not there .
i was never been in .
harvest <unk> .
with the eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
in 2010 : a young woman named president <unk> , and says , and says , how they were dying of their parents , their parents were dying in the war .
we &apos;re going to be segregated in rural areas and everything we do in this room , we &apos;re going to create a space .
i failed .
i want to see 20 years from now , and you see that there was a <unk> girl , a <unk> , <unk> girl on this screen 101 .
lg : how to happen .
licklider realized , computer can do that they can do that they do , to collect spaces and decisions .
each of you are recorded by a more sensors , your <unk> , your computer , your computer , you know , it &apos;s a lot of data , and we get the opportunity to understand our existence .
these were military <unk> .
by the way a <unk> process is introduced a task for 40 months , was a mere simple piece of 40 months , was a mere simple piece of three people in 40 hours . all of the time .
we should stop looking outside .
the dinner with my wife and the kids cry home .
because these people say , &quot; well , &quot; i didn &apos;t want to be a time ; i want to become a time ; i want to get a time ; you want to become a time ; you want to become you .
she was a much of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a dog , when i thought .
this impacts all the impacts .
the <unk> of the bedrock of the bedrock of the bedrock of the bedrock of the bedrock of the bedrock of the bedrock of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
think about <unk> , <unk> .
in the era , we have more common in common .
and they all have done that , and if not , they &apos;re going to have to .
help me get to new jaw to make it , help me make a sexy sexy .
so i thought this would be a opportunity to use a interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical , which is what the <unk> .
in this case , you take a <unk> , you add it to a pile and the <unk> of <unk> , the behavior of the different characters in a story , a story , in this case , the case of the big bang .
if you learn to code , you can program programming code .
if kids like a glimpse of intelligent projects , they learn important concepts , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today is talk to you today to give you the idea that cars are art .
i want to talk .
and i think that idea that this notion that sincere is a soul , very useful , is very viable . they all know that they all know , you know , you know how much it is .
this is one of my favorite <unk> that really our relationship to the cars .
right ? and she decided that it would be cheaper to be a studio and seven or seven creatures , <unk> in malibu to american rock .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt ourselves , we felt , we &apos;re going to develop the census of the day , we &apos;re going to go through the real nature of true and creativity .
we didn &apos;t have him to boston .
and i just got a little bit of the lab .
now , we have a clinical trials in four ways of this disease .
we have no team of <unk> and <unk> that can be transformed this with this animal .
100 billion , the only numbers you have to know .
what you think is that we have to do with a universe , with a universe , with a hundred billion stars .
what he did not explained to be , why was the entropy was low low .
in contrast to the low entropy universe , we even prevent the answer in the response , we don &apos;t know the answer to explain this , although we don &apos;t know , we have a good theory that can explain this theory , and that the theory of the dark is the dark .
and so , while the universe is forever , although the universe lasts is <unk> and <unk> , and the ordinary matter will allow some thermal fluctuations on radiation , some of the thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but it also happens big fluctuations .
it &apos;s cools .
it &apos;s a <unk> arrangement of the universe that you don &apos;t accept .
i never used computers .
it was a future i didn &apos;t accept .
now i want to say something that i want to say something like me , say , &quot; the poor and the poor people .
i don &apos;t care about my real world was just using my physical world , just had a <unk> in the digital world , and eight years ago .
i took this very painful , i took my <unk> , and then it sat down a little bit of <unk> , the front of the car .
the camera doesn &apos;t understand my movements , but i &apos;m capable of understanding things that i &apos;m holding in my hand .
and why are we just <unk> ? we can &apos;t play with a handle .
all of the work you &apos;ve been talking about my study in india .
this is juan , king of spain .
this is the <unk> park in rio park in rio now , in rio .
again , again , again , you don &apos;t have to dig into the earth to build a <unk> .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example .
almost every year we have this terrible <unk> .
we &apos;re the average in relation to the <unk> in the city .
one city of the future is a city that nobody wants to charge the artistic of this great community , which is the cities .
the best answer to it is to try to reconstruct a darwinian capacity to reconstruct a darwinian capacity to reconstruct our lives and political preferences .
the trick of evolution is , they &apos;re beautifully to do it , so you can make a kind of magnetic <unk> , so they just got the picture .
and some of them are in each case for the slaughter .
our strong response to the images of feelings in art , the beauty of music is about the night sky , and we might be able to be our offspring , as long as the human genome exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see how the computer are looking at the surroundings , and since the rapid can &apos;t see the rapid , we can see the driver , we can see what &apos;s going on .
even see if you can avoid .
or for the blind people , in everyday <unk> , in in everyday education , in the training and in the office .
a 50-year-old <unk> had begun begun . the <unk> that people don &apos;t hear voices , and i but they decided that something couldn &apos;t identify .
my <unk> <unk> was a catalyst for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and sexual <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , because cancer is easier to heal the tasmanian lighter than schizophrenia . &quot;
to reiterate <unk> , if the social change starts to start to the social change , it can &apos;t be more <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is , that &apos;s where we should look for mars , more than mars , although , even though , although a very much more nuanced and more interesting place .
and the ordinary thing was full of contempt on the <unk> .
because it &apos;s the kind of life that &apos;s out there , it has tremendous life compared with tremendous tools compared to a planet .
there was another object , this highly <unk> <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> -- quite a <unk> for a little kid .
the first projects were keystone , but they took technology and perhaps compute how they might be able to use them into things that people can use and maybe a new functionality .
the other thing that is <unk> , is that we decided to solve all the technical gadgets , and that we decided to solve all the technical gadgets , and trying to make it possible as much as possible as possible .
so we decided it &apos;s y . so this is another example , where everything goes into a room : the three-dimensional design in a room : the three-dimensional design that development , the development of the brand , it &apos;s all intimately .
this is my favorite muse , in switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to fill it again .
yves behar about the design of objects that tell stories stories stories .
thank you .
my aunt , a incredibly <unk> and brilliant woman , and brilliant woman , was a hot pig .
she was the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the most <unk> <unk> for the most <unk> <unk> for the most honest <unk> for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the most vulnerable for the
look at these young girls , who was going to school , after their faces , in their faces , in their faces , in their faces , in their faces , in their faces . &quot;
the world that had been given <unk> was a world in war .
then , the situation are going to be .
you need to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation , in a world , in a world where everything is encoded in the <unk> and and in some of our best friends in a screen .
finally , it could print your own medicine .
and if it floats , why is the most interesting thing , then you have to look at the rest of the saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that &apos;s technically the is the <unk> between the .
maybe some things are traditions and they need .
let me show you an example of the architect : in turkey , , we had come from recently recently something that i was going to call that a very <unk> problem , against the universities should be the <unk> , against <unk> .
so if i would think the only person would think that &apos;s worth , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as old than the old europe of the , they were independent .
so , as it was built in the eu process that the efforts of turkey , the eu , within turkey , within turkey muslims were against some of the <unk> nations against some of the economy .
there &apos;s a very big nose , which is not the usual nose , when they were responding to anything .
if scientists today , a century , neurons , neurons , neurons are going to be able to do this . instead of doing it .
carl <unk> : glimpses of our brain brain
this is a really clear .
but for many parts africa has a colleague of mine , &quot; the time , &quot; the whole of the day , the right time , the genocide . &quot;
and instead of trying to have local power , local leaders and have to radically separate leaders , and they have to have a different <unk> of the <unk> , and the wars in the iraq .
<unk> design requires requires a strong focus on the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
the stromatolites are the heroes of my story .
in flat , life has been alive ; here &apos;s where they are flashing in .
<unk> was about continents , the big community started .
some of the mammal back to the water .
everybody &apos;s going to have a chance to be a little luxury .
but there was nothing for this , so we have <unk> with prostate cancer , so we have <unk> with prostate cancer , and then we have our slogan , &quot; the face of health of health is changing health . &quot;
mo <unk> , from canada , from the united states and and and and from the <unk> and said , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year we had fortunate to have lucky to have been <unk> . &quot;
this kind of entertainment , men , in every time , it &apos;s important and important , and my opinion , so much more important than the money we &apos;re going .
he could see what his forest was , because his environment was going to be used under his <unk> , because his grandfather had to age and started talking about the forest and the way of his failures .
when i think about it , i &apos;m going to tell what our grandchildren and our school and when they ask the same question .
we need new models and human chunk of our world .
they &apos;re working with people like <unk> .
a life of the lives , through everything , everything , so that he &apos;s going to talk about today , today , today &apos;s been done today , after his museum has been harassed .
it just happens .
&quot; my world is designed . &quot;
or maybe he was just a guy who sat on a rock and the skies , and the sun and the sun and the moon .
and if you have a living life in the <unk> , you &apos;re going to get into the <unk> or the way the french says , &quot; the sky -- -- the sky .
and so this is why great rituals that big <unk> <unk> in which big <unk> of the <unk> , and for 10 days .
see what is the business as a result of the market and the outcome is a result of the market and behavior ?
see , this is india today , the <unk> of the pesticide is based on a <unk> device .
you know , he has the largest <unk> , called &quot; big <unk> . &quot;
&quot; why i voted this path to say why i &apos;m not interested in the part of just asking me . &quot;
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the eyes of india and the west -- and , why these <unk> systems of the brain , and the west systems of the <unk> , the <unk> of death and the <unk> help us helping us helping us helping us helping us , we help us <unk> .
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost <unk> and the world , &quot; i &apos;m completely and totally competent , &quot; , &quot; means that , even themselves with the greatest preacher .
your interest is in comparison to what ?
their friends and family will gather the <unk> , and there , on their baby , a tombstone , on their toy , a great engineer , &quot; here &apos;s a wonderful engineer , the <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re thrilled . this is the conversation that welfare mothers and fathers will stop because your child &apos;s good , and you know what &apos;s next .
that &apos;s because they -- they know what they &apos;re .
i haven &apos;t have a patents and i never have saved the money of a medical <unk> , and i don &apos;t know that they choose me .
where do you know , if your chest is inherently <unk> ?
mr has more complex to other features that in the relationship of other technologies , and it &apos;s not very common .
if you find a tumor , as long as a fold , it &apos;s less than a centimeter of big big big big , is the <unk> of 90 percent , but they &apos;re introducing with the <unk> .
the image of the mbi shows , this tumor much more important than a second tumor that is strong to the surgical possibilities of patient .

it &apos;s a flying laboratory with the <unk> carpet we &apos;ve been able to put measurements in the region .
but i have no bad guys , and he never got the <unk> <unk> in the air , but it &apos;s been going to be the same .
so , from <unk> , great -- from which i think a picture of a <unk> , which is ultimately going to land in my work .
i work for the new yorker , and i make <unk> , and then the eleventh was , and that was , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

td : how lakshmi has worked incredibly hard to work very hard to the invitation , but by everything else , so that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing , and i was sometimes quite a little bit , and i was so nervous .
in those two examples , we &apos;ve seen the in the simulation of simulation , and others that have learned in the way that it has learned in the way .
when i say , &quot; we were the advice for the <unk> .

and i think even our leaders would say our leaders would say that we have very much more .
i &apos;m really excited to answer your questions .
our centers for a <unk> state of <unk> , one of them evolved to the lab -- as a drug <unk> .
and in the circumstances of the <unk> , people were similar to the toll of the infections are not a problem .
not just how much fun , you &apos;ve got to learn how much fun , but how can change the way that the way that a city of changing the way to interact with a city like san francisco .
please join me a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to be a boy from a young intern from a force , and he was welcomed to <unk> , to sell three .
but since my childhood , i played with <unk> and climbing , the issue is , i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
the manhattan isn &apos;t in the infinite .

because of the <unk> , and the cambridge is very dark , and very quietly .
i &apos;m going to show my colleagues of the <unk> that <unk> us for the dynamism of the <unk> that lived in the forest .
we &apos;re advising with the media , we have a <unk> ; we have a memorable ; we have <unk> .
and then they &apos;re students in our <unk> , and their own their own their own their own <unk> with their own .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn that the inmates and we learn to the frog <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the high endangered mass of the <unk> <unk> in the states .
he said , &quot; look , what you have you . &quot;
so we &apos;re looking at a rising demand , and so that &apos;s why that &apos;s why that &apos;s why that &apos;s why that &apos;s why that &apos;s why that &apos;s why that &apos;s why that &apos;s why that &apos;s why that &apos;s why .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you &apos;ve got to believe me . trust me . &quot;
i learned two things .
so we &apos;re deeper under the water , the higher is the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
if you go the air in the <unk> , when you comes the air out of the <unk> .
so each of these computer can operate the entire system , so if two of them are there , there &apos;s still time .
but this is what it looks like , and this is the <unk> that goes on a lot of miles .
so sharks are not quite dangerous as most people do they do .
when we were him , we couldn &apos;t even know what the way we couldn &apos;t even do it , so we called it <unk> &#91; we called him , after the <unk> , because it &apos;s like , as he was going on his books .
the <unk> is a <unk> and he <unk> .
this means that every one of each and every one of you know here at least one of the child , the <unk> of a <unk> .
and his communication and social interactions is going to be a normal school visit , he could be able to visit a normal visit , and even a <unk> priest .
it &apos;s like the life life : if you first have a mate , you can &apos;t figure out .
i know that you &apos;ve never heard about it . but you would tell you this day , someday you someday , you might hear her about him because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he &apos;s already 25 years ago .
he &apos;s going to see his lot of love , he loved everybody .
we all of us , what happens when a <unk> of hydrogen and helium , if a <unk> of hydrogen and helium , that they start talking about their origins .
this <unk> prove that life in many different parts of the other .
so you have to understand diversity , the outpouring of life on the planet in the first step in the first step of learning , to estimate , to estimate , in all the rest of all .
so , by <unk> , as aluminum as aluminum as aluminum as aluminum , and we &apos;ll get it into 350 antennae , so it &apos;s become more convenient and the moore &apos;s law of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and then we would like to like to upgrade the <unk> search engine of human rights .
many , it was the best place of the world to investigate the evolution of climate change .
each cylinder is a time of time .
as you &apos;re using the ice sheet , they <unk> , <unk> , you put a new pair of gloves in a oven , they can have a new pair of your skin and their fingers .
i think this is a little bit of <unk> .
and our soldiers is not just to just to learn to the public health care in <unk> , if you &apos;ve got to service american <unk> .
you can continue to do this , and the efficiency almost sexual <unk> , with some <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s the <unk> of the big <unk> .
we build the climate crisis , which is also the security , but they should be .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan , because we &apos;re not allowed to have a shelter , and the rest of our <unk> and the others .
by the way the dmca of materials , or in this kind of materials , or in this case , the depletion of <unk> <unk> , as a good <unk> , as good <unk> , the anthropocene , the way it can be in the internet .
it cannot act to act a giant <unk> conspiracy .
there were two kinds of abstract situations that we have .
hope we hoping that it &apos;s really stable .

he found a <unk> , a dutch <unk> named van meegeren named van meegeren called <unk> van , who had a wonderful tedtalk for a prize , which is the $ 100 million dollars .
according to his <unk> , he saw it , when he discovered the first time , there was the world in the world . &quot;
&quot; it depends on the radar . what &apos;s it ? &quot; is an good answer .
but how attractive they find them as a very they find , &quot; the <unk> or magnets , depends on the way they think they &apos;re looking at .
but each one of these three objects has a value beyond what it is a complete history .
but i don &apos;t want to be a copy , even if i can &apos;t recognize the difference .
so he came joshua bell , his <unk> with a <unk> hall in washington d.c. , and he turned out how much money he can make .
the second thing is going to be a little bit of time .
and if you can see , you can see that there may be a kind of political <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> by that you &apos;re a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of the american <unk> of the american <unk> of the <unk> of the american <unk> of the <unk> of the american <unk> of the <unk> , which is very glamorous and exciting .
and what you see is that people who are pickled and olive oil olive olive olive olive oil food , fewer <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> , if you &apos;re a drug in a high seas dose , they &apos;re going to be more popular , and that you &apos;re going to look better .
the big answer is closer to the true .
this is a problem , for it doesn &apos;t have any solution .
and very soon , they would like to create these emergent <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and back to china and all over the world .
can you imagine how you feel at my point if you were to be ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; they know , all know .
there &apos;s this thing , the <unk> of the world , and the is the right line from the middle of the united states .

can imagine that maybe one of you at his morning , and it &apos;s been to the <unk> , and said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m going to go back .
everything has changed .
and all of the document has enormous implications in the world .
i think , &quot; did really did really good in words in words .
for the <unk> in the audience , why <unk> , a bigger budget , which is a greater budget -- that &apos;s because it &apos;s a bigger budget -- so that &apos;s the market in other languages , so that &apos;s the market for these films .
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
this is not the <unk> of the united states , which is going to be about a million people , but gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and also , like everybody here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is a prosthetic <unk> , a prosthetic commitment that fits the back of the gulf <unk> on the <unk> .

&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about a contemporary businessman , the his life is , and the between and realities and reality and reality and reality and reality and not able to <unk> both .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> and the and the first time later , what was a <unk> of a world-class talented model .
i know that the theater .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to provide a clever system , and so what &apos;s extraordinary and extraordinary and <unk> .
if you look at the bathroom , you see some more products like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also the rest of the war .

hundreds of verbs can behave .
you can see the language of consciousness , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why users are , useful , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> often ?
you can try to imagine what would be literally literally being used literally .
and the other puzzles is that i don &apos;t have a problem .
here &apos;s my argument . it &apos;s the underdog , it &apos;s good ?
this is it <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what do you have to convince it ?
all of these different roles . can you participate in a mathematician where they participate , but also in the audience , but in the audience , and you can sit down ?
or -- and this is the most important part for me : we want to make us into the world of nature , we want to put a <unk> and find the masters of the change in nature that can us inspire us .
this changed everything . there was not more about goods as the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the most primitive lab lab lab .
they would be able to be able to get rid of the better if you could have a <unk> .
this is not just easy , because life is just a subset of the elements in the world .
feel about feedback is very important .
what you can &apos;t see , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a <unk> . i started under the taliban .
sri in south and indonesia are almost half a million companies women .
because , as well as the <unk> <unk> , smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the world is not exceptions .
people would have to do if this <unk> and this <unk> .
i have a wrist <unk> <unk> of calcium , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and then to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it , to <unk> .
first , we have modified .
what does that mean ?
when i started to get to you , i was realizing that they were incredibly adept .
but the researchers had a problem .
and you end up your head and enveloping the campus -- and certainly -- were too -- and certainly , some time later , and i was a few years later , that the crows still have to be aware of them .
we found that they &apos;re really clever and they can teach each other .
aside , squirrels , you would go to the peanut , and they go back .
but there were three problems , three puzzles i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about this , but i want to talk even more importantly : i found a <unk> .
who would ever ever do ? &quot;
and think what was going on , what was going on , because each of the region has something .
let me make the connection .
you know , there &apos;s the main idea of the future , you need to understand .
this is a lot of <unk> .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny &apos;s sounds .

he had a line in his book , who was obsessed with the <unk> -- and there was a <unk> maria maria <unk> , who was the difficulty of the patient &apos;s trouble .
so now they have a evolutionary sample .
she said -- i have to teach you what she said , because i think it &apos;s so beautifully .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . i don &apos;t want to use it . i wanted to see him .
and this is actually the beginnings of our history .
now i would have to say , at this moment , that in the age of age , one of the skills that i really had to be really , was to bind my shoes .
i &apos;ve got to say that i &apos;m not going to be about here .
yes . the artists doesn &apos;t seem to translate the different colors .
but i can see in their faces , they &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while i decided to have been a while i decided to have a few things , and before i left the room i was a few things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all right here .
my father was a <unk> , my youth was interesting .
the song is as mere .
i i &apos;m sure , &quot; yeah , i &apos;m going to try to the inevitable , and i built them and i built them and i built them and -- and i reproduced them and -- and i could say , i &apos;m going to ask them . i mean , i &apos;m going to ask them . i mean , i &apos;m going to ask them . i mean , i &apos;m going to ask them . i mean , i &apos;m going to ask them .
it sounds like , but i think we &apos;re in our society and culture with the <unk> , a <unk> .
he had the <unk> <unk> , and he was really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really
man , i love the thing .
the aftermath of a planet , on the same people live .
it &apos;s especially specifically proud of it , the <unk> touches , he had been able to put his <unk> <unk> , he had been able to find his <unk> <unk> , and on the beautiful sea .
intention , a life with intent -- mostly , the original thing to <unk> .
i saw the following of a stroke of a stroke and i was <unk> that she was retired , <unk> , all of the things that i didn &apos;t yet yet , but not more possible .
then i started thinking about how many times in the life , as my life was different , if that man doesn &apos;t even have me if my genes was a different appreciation of experience .
i was i was i was in a <unk> i was myself , so i was so , i made myself to myself .
i had a lot simpler physical : this turkish <unk> against four words , against the <unk> against four words , and then back to my way to my way to my way to my way .
he spent six months months months months , lost his arm for a decade .
yeah , contrast .
we work with interfaces <unk> , <unk> <unk> , san diego .
the first thing that perceptions of people , and secondly , a natural interface , a natural form of the , so that the interaction with the robot .
and i did i really made this idea .
after i &apos;ve been doing this economic danger , i thought we find a solution for this problem .
some people even have taken even more sophisticated to the <unk> sitcom of the nathan , or or the or or the glorious forest , which is the <unk> .
i know , no tedtalk that &apos;s the <unk> .
i &apos;ve got 25 cents , because i found the job was something harder .
and yet , there was one of the time , all of all the sudden , the expansion were slower .
keep the mystery of dark energy in the spirit , because i &apos;m going to give you three clips to string theory .
the <unk> on the outside , on the back of the back about 10 high levels .
and he was just going to explain decades of the science , but he had no success , and we know why we know why .
each of these universes has additional dimensions .
because the astronomers of today , by the sky , by the sky , a handful of a <unk> <unk> photons -- a kind of <unk> <unk> , a kind of <unk> <unk> , a kind of <unk> <unk> , a kind of <unk> , <unk> .
well , i want to be honest with you and told that most of them is just a trick , but a trick , the fact .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time that they would like him , we would like to make them really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really , really , really , really , really , and more .
he said , &quot; you , milo , milo .
pm : this is dimitri , dimitri in <unk> .
we know here &apos;s nobody .
in the next moment , the phone is not more , who is tv , the tv goes out of the road , and the tv goes out of the road there .
it was a very grim <unk> , the collaborators of cheap , the collaborators of cheap , and of course , the <unk> , in the short people of people themselves .
if i &apos;m going to ask , why i &apos;m going to make , i &apos;m going to show why i &apos;m going to stay , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my profession , and this testimony <unk> and this is the <unk> that &apos;s the core of the thing , for us .
even before a goal is to be a <unk> <unk> , which tries to seek out to find the goal , wherever it &apos;s it .
we basically <unk> the animals that they gain and objects in the world .
in a experiment we were going to make a few years ago , we went to the end of the .
so we start in china .
so , dai manju was ready .
please raise the hand .
the last reason has to do with that women , the solution , not the solution .
she dies in the canoe of seven women at birth of a child .
they &apos;ve been part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , when he dips skiing , once it can be good that investment in the developing world bank , once it can be good at the developing world . &quot;
this is bill <unk> &apos;s book .
and this was the feather of a couple of weeks .
this whole thing is to tell you an intermediate of our <unk> tells us that there &apos;s a <unk> .
and even this image is the evidence of the evidence was the evidence was to be <unk> -- like something like the <unk> &amp; amp ; es <unk> .
one of the ways that we could have been able to have a little toy .
you put your arrowheads , and say , &quot; i want to announce this , &quot; and we don &apos;t have 50 50 to 50 . &quot;
there &apos;s 21,000 on this island , where they all three three miles into a new language .
if 27 came from 27 , a table , your 23 <unk> <unk> , you just say just a simple , you know , just to give you an armed of <unk> <unk> , to be prepared to all the <unk> possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they also know about language .
and what interests me about the most critical place between a text and the invisible space between a text and the image of text , and how the image is going to change the text .
these are <unk> <unk> , which is about the bottom of the atlantic ocean , and north europe .
they turn the negative negative .
but by leveraging <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , can change the change .
larry <unk> served eight years of <unk> <unk> , in arizona , in arizona , for the kidnapping and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> boys on a <unk> .
so , in fact , people are changing .
and they &apos;ve been fooled for us to rebuild .
and now they &apos;re cross-country with mit , where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the vastness of the animal kingdom , which is what happens as a threshold .
so something called something called a sense : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
in fact , the legacy of humanity <unk> , who &apos;s striving for the <unk> pound , which is the pursuit of happiness to <unk> aspects of the individual aspects of the individual and branching to the reality .
a <unk> in science of happiness is that happiness and adversity is not a <unk> <unk> in a closed-loop <unk> .
it starts in the <unk> jungle .
here &apos;s a three weeks baby baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one possibility to the status of the body .
i want to conclude with some of the side .
why should you choose ?
as blindness , the rat understood that we &apos;ve got the job a little bit .
you can actually heal the t.b. of mental illness , even people are hiv .
with the idea that a patient , the <unk> , the to 15 people -- 15 people -- 15 people -- 15 -- 15 people -- a year , can be that we &apos;ve probably had already many lives .
so here we see neurons .
so it &apos;s important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question : if i just just like another person , why not i &apos;m not going to be confused , literally this <unk> bureau of behaviors , like somebody else ?
thank you . i &apos;ve got two missions .
i &apos;m not going to quote it actually not about the <unk> , but the pollen itself .
all of these pictures were brought through a <unk> jacket by the lab of <unk> <unk> .
even each one has a story about tell us the <unk> .
we need to be as good as the information that we can do .
right , the time , in the 1980s , in the 1980s , when we were women and death and death and death and death and the death would be available for the new england of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s watch this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for women , <unk> , for women , the distribution of the heart of the heart of the heart , and every time we think about , if we &apos;re just a little bit of radiation , we ask , &quot; is this test really required ? &quot;
okay , here we start .
they &apos;ve done what they said , they &apos;ve got <unk> and are campaigns .
the cells have something like <unk> ; it doesn &apos;t matter .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we took every day eight years ago , and collected about a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> , which was a little more than a year that really warned us .
and finally , my son is in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> roy to see here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic .
this is the first time that our son were made more than two steps on the movie .
and this is an important to question , because the reason why we can communicate , the better meaning , the better meaning , the better , the better we can think about it , and work .
it &apos;s a bit like a center where you see a picture and think &quot; oh ! i have an strong or emotional response to the . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is to paint our <unk> <unk> on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about it , but to make the opportunity for the time .
so it doesn &apos;t end up there .
if you &apos;re going to get into the savings , if you have a <unk> and window , then we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , then we &apos;re broken to be broken , that has to be biologically .
this is the difference .
so we have a more nuanced .
are we just stupid ?
you can read it in 2,300 enough , when you read about eight hours a day .
so rome , you can helicopter , and say , &quot; i &apos;m going to be important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police force on the ground of the fire of the fire , to engage the car in the order to engage the body of the sea .
and the footprint in the present states , the <unk> in the united states , on the future <unk> .
all of us , we leads to the <unk> , except for the ultimate thing that we do most of the most important devices .
this is the implication of the destruction of more than a third of the brain of the brain &apos;s right side by the .
this is a very , very low , to be discharged from the healthcare system .
he stopped holding my jaw in the right position during the right position during the right position .
alfred mann is a deep physicist and the <unk> , who is the <unk> , the census of the subject , whether it &apos;s a <unk> mashup of hearing hearing , or a blind or a a charity .
now i had to explain back in the dark , the proclamation , what i was supposed to know about what that was happening .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : if you &apos;re the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were big families : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are here on this side , a large <unk> of africa and the the the the the .
and then came to the end of the people and brought money to china and the land over the country .
one of the ways that we can copy the data into a <unk> format , and the world of the world in the world , and what do we hear if we are ?
but it &apos;s created the hypotheses .
you know , darwin has life explained , after it &apos;s developed , what does the essence of life ?
and there i learned francis crick .
there was a lot of the literature .
we weren &apos;t the best chemists in the room .
i was the popular unhappy ; my girls saved me .
you can compare it with the dna and <unk> <unk> .
and so i &apos;m going to increase the way to the point of that , i &apos;m going to tell you about 20 people with schizophrenia .
average costs the defense investment in a case , two million dollars and it takes 18 months , if you win .
first , they &apos;re not against the patent , but the patent is not against the <unk> .
my solution : please give me this patent and i will be able to run them with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; &quot; asked the girls .
the fathers were in a place where they move their daughters , and they move their <unk> , and their hand were able to do dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in humans .
can &apos;t see the intensity of the most of the most of the time , and we have a different approach to polio polio than we were doing it with smallpox .
it has helped to be a pandemic , <unk> .
the realities of polio is something quite different .
and yet , the impossible is .
bill gates : well bruce : well bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how we were polio polio to the verge of
dj : we found this <unk> now , at all possible animals , especially with the beetle .
and we &apos;ve been to our surprise , it was a <unk> .
for us , this elephant is a symbol for inspiration , a symbol of this hope that hope that hope that hope that we have to work in our work .
it was incredibly amazing than they took into safety , and it &apos;s been stripped on the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these <unk> , the <unk> , you know , i was going on a fashion sense of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic , because your destiny in your hand .
we need it . we respect each other , as a community and woman , as a community and as a part of this planet and we &apos;ve got to put it on .
after all , it &apos;s obvious that the earth is the earth and <unk> , and the sun klein , and the sun klein , but it &apos;s worth what <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of the interests , there &apos;s a viable .
nature &apos;s nature that &apos;s nature depends on this ocean , which kind of animal is .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because between them not the same way you &apos;re not allowed to tell you in middle world , like that we see in middle world , and then it &apos;s like .
people are scientifically to treat scientifically and <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> , if you want to guess what the person is going to be .
i was talking about the <unk> <unk> in the southwest age of age .
i &apos;m going to debut with my head , i &apos;m going to give these <unk> , allowing me to see the <unk> of robot and send to send a <unk> in a <unk> .
with people like them , we can create this dream .
in the skull , a <unk> lexicon of <unk> <unk> , by the <unk> <unk> , by the <unk> that are the dolphins .
i think we can create a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from .
but usually don &apos;t usually do this .
i think we may be able to look at the infrastructure of globalization .
this is now at 12 percent , condensed .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i suppose that most of you don &apos;t speak -- what really is really , if you &apos;re told that this is the most common language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this image , you think , you think , &quot; why should i work &quot; why should i work ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that it can allow it to allow the and the world and its place in its place .
you would get it and safety , religious violence , religious violence , who never had to <unk> terrorists .
and one of this is honesty .
what &apos;s that ?
i love court .
and the war , the 20 million people in life , all the world &apos;s civil war .
<unk> sen , who &apos;s this guy : &quot; i &apos;ve got all this time to accomplish all this money , but i &apos;ve all spent all this time that my american man stole my own man .
chinese restaurants have the same thing , largely , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant -- even the restaurant -- but without a <unk> .
in contrast , we have <unk> <unk> chicken , which was when i was just at the early 1970s , when i was just at the university in new york city in new york city in new york city .
so what we &apos;re in the 17th century , 18th century , the <unk> <unk> search for the medicine of <unk> , the same creates the same .
so , people would have a big picture .
when the <unk> started the <unk> , i became a <unk> until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
remember , when a kid learns ?
and then , in 18 and 19 , i slept the night .
i &apos;m going to be more depressed and something .
so many of us is clear that it &apos;s much more in the next few years .
he &apos;s going to say , &quot; how does it be like ? &quot;
you know , where the people knows about the world in the greatest problems of the greatest problems that are spreading from the potential of unreliable , and climate change ?
if you do the impossible , you make it possible .
but we have a desktop sample of climate .
and there was god god .
the <unk> is something remarkable : you use two ingredients , proteins and water , to create a material that &apos;s as important , a material that &apos;s as important as a symptom , and the <unk> of how the gene .
or you &apos;re <unk> beautiful things like this , if you can do this .
here &apos;s what you see here is how it &apos;s being recorded .
with my new project , organic <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also microphone that &apos;s going to be the actual medium and the bar , and the bar -- hopefully no -- to help him some of the next decisions .
what should i do ? &quot;
in the 2008 , i &apos;ve never got a low-tech <unk> , who can get a <unk> , who can get a <unk> , who can get his <unk> his audience and see his behavior of his audience and symbols and might be his behavior of the answers .
stanley , the inventor of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that it &apos;s between five to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships , relationships ?
there was a <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you about it , and i might have this <unk> , in the ear .
am god -- my dad ?
it was his dad was trying to have false papers .
this feeling of the responsibility of 17 years , he had written his young written in 17 years , and his fault , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , he was made out of a camp , he was going to be able to live his entire life .
and as my favorite <unk> and my <unk> , my <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , my father &apos;s false papers papers .
i asked him what i was asked , at the victim that he had been doing , if he ever had ever had ever had .
we &apos;re moving from a few million people in seven billion people we are now .
the arctic is , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> level , which is a <unk> of the next <unk> , which is the seemingly state of the next <unk> that &apos;s seemingly state .
if you multiply the forest , the border tag on the <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> the ability to stay stable .
with the notion of <unk> , fishermen , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the great utilitarian infections is incredible , logical , the current <unk> <unk> .
but the drama is natural , of course , that <unk> changes is not option .
that leads to another reason why i &apos;m going to show today : because i &apos;m now media here today today .
this is a <unk> of a race , <unk> .
first , he takes a ancient kind of opportunity that <unk> and digest this with a three-dimensional perspective , and what a whole new technique .
and by the other hand axes , i hired portraits of chinese <unk> , i made portraits of them .
it was very big images and i took them with a very big camera camera on a <unk> camera .
my interest in <unk> , particularly to worse <unk> , <unk> , enough , enough , enough , enough , enough , enough , enough , enough .
so , on top of the , is a sequence that they have .
we can ask questions : there &apos;s a difference between empiricism and <unk> ?
and then they can compare it with the same age of the genome .
we can apply the same questions that the same questions , as for neanderthal : do you have to make people with the ancestors of the world ?
there &apos;s lots of people who are their own business , social 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane was the airplane of the future .
imagine imagine <unk> , subscribe grow , and are in a <unk> embedded that &apos;s in their components , and follow the forces that are in their components .
they &apos;re not supposed to be . but especially they were seeing so extraordinarily isolated , from their surroundings and the people .
they would be <unk> . they would call 911 .
and we know , it &apos;s about a one of 100 .
you see a video .
you have the sense that the research that you have a sense that the research that you have a effect on the other experiences that they can prevent these experiences , and i think my way to this field .
then you &apos;re looking at .
<unk> <unk> : you &apos;re going to be able to <unk> in a rigid health , arms , arms <unk> , arms .
they did all of the same as we had taught .
and after the battle , they bring this rock , and they make it , &quot; <unk> &quot; calls &quot; calls &quot; you get wrong .
even the people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this isn &apos;t a single .
and she showed the left to tell me what the image was , as a mere image was to tell me how black holes were had been subsidized .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the <unk> that i think a new set of questions that i ask .
now , this is sort of the obvious statement .
and the kids were told , &quot; how shall we do this . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you insure her before before you decided that you were doing nothing ? &quot;
their <unk> counterparts , they increased <unk> , which otherwise wants to reinvent the most violent biotechnology teachers .
was 76 percent . when they went on , two months later , the outcome was going to be .
after eight , he wanted to be <unk> <unk> da vinci .
these are the .
suddenly i looked out of darkness , on the <unk> page of the river , a <unk> of the mirrors that was launched from the moon .
if i go through a whole story on a picture , what would it be about ?
so i &apos;m going to show you some of my closest big project in this year , &quot;
and our little lives ends into a sleeping zone .
bono : &quot; they &apos;re <unk> .
i know that they understand .
so , blue , blue , everything was blue .
i &apos;d like to tell you two stories . both are playing in africa .
it &apos;s another , the interface of health and the business .
let &apos;s specify the <unk> <unk> , which we use the <unk> <unk> , which we have , and figure out what price of the people would have to pay it .
thank you .
the <unk> was this : if my mom couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t fix it in the video .
we &apos;re creating two <unk> and 10 tv .
the little <unk> <unk> that is inherently out of its trace , and that was a problem .
this is quite good . it &apos;s going to slow down .
i would like to show you a clip show by a few of the same thing i work with work .
so , tissue from <unk> and behavior is the second part of the second , and that &apos;s actually the key to be able to use this models for <unk> .
thank you .
and they just just fly to the fact , as a attempt to shoot a tough job , and it was tough work with the <unk> end of the <unk> end , and boy , i &apos;ve got a lot of respect to nature .
now , we see the other side .
we work in projects -- even <unk> , such as <unk> -- and with darpa , as <unk> -- and the contractor institute of violence and the university of the university .
they were carefully , just act like wood , or something like , &quot;
now i tried to be <unk> .
they &apos;re going to go .
these are over two billion .
it &apos;s demand for his estimate , maybe three years .
don &apos;t forget the one .
but for me , is because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time , where we live in life , in human mind , in human mind and machines .
i have a very clear crowd . where you get from ?
it &apos;s too hard to be too afraid that the way in 20 years .
all of evidence that the evidence that this cancer is that this cancer is a virus .
i took the opportunity and i was able to create a few samples of jonas , a few samples of the rest of the rest of the body .
she brought him into the day and this individual &apos;s something called <unk> .
finally , cancer is a fundamental state of ability to share our cells and to decide what their surroundings .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is an global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> to wait for .
and this is why the third reason why a low sense makes us not happy .
but yet they didn &apos;t feel that the numbers of the numbers .
first i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> for optimism .
but the good news is that our illusion are not going to break when we &apos;re going to be aware of this <unk> .
but what we see in the 21st century , is asia , the incrementally is , the incrementally is more than half more than half the world &apos;s population and half the global economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of the <unk> .
after the <unk> years , the soviets sputnik was <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s like , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re living in japan or <unk> your view of china , or <unk> your view of china , something different than they live in beijing life .
and if we &apos;re strategies in strategies , we &apos;re going to be historic , we will consequently be able to do to live .
how do we know our national interests , so that it &apos;s not just a <unk> dollar , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of positive workers , positive sum of
this is the conventional approach .
this has led to the responsibility to <unk> <unk> to guarantee a stable <unk> .
they are familiar with the internet .
jobs ? for whom ? for whom ?
after the first place , the printer is , you can &apos;t get the even bigger .
the power would be informed about the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the own conflict , government .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of my hometown .
the military has gone . they famously &apos;s climate change that safety and stability , the safety of the world in the world , as well as a car is .
it allows you to become more productive , they can afford to afford more productive , they can afford themselves .
these are certainly new examples of the solutions in solutions , if we feel able to feel able to plan for a spinning world .
listen to students like chinese students english by receiving .
teachers : perfect ! student : students : perfect !
and the includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , <unk> , which we &apos;re trying to do , and we also try to do this hypothetical , , and we also wonder the hypothetical seriously , so we &apos;re asking wonder what might be going to be .
for luria , they were killing , before they were <unk> in scientific age , and he found that these people are used to found that these are all the way across the world .
and there &apos;s luria : &quot; north pole is always snow .
they chose to new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the distribution of honor .
would they would be killed ? &quot;
they could say , a a half .
it feels like i was in a critique of angels . &quot;
and she <unk> me to make a degree in anything .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris , it &apos;s called the personal , that movie .
i &apos;m a of her favorite <unk> .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is serious .
we all the time : why do you do that ?
this is a lot of the real time when you read it . &quot;
we had always been always born after school , about weeks of weeks , about weeks of weeks , and we had all 50 together to <unk> .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people have good jobs and the <unk> of the <unk> .
it &apos;s like your own little connection .
if i all all three legs , in the three peaks , in the three peaks , i would get a <unk> .
so all you do is -- it &apos;s a very <unk> case -- this old <unk> and this old plastic gyre , and this old plastic , the <unk> is just very simple in a old rag .
this is possible , if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> <unk> paper -- you can be a <unk> school in a state school in a state school , a a a ruler , a ruler , no need , no need , no need .
what we do is , is a very simple <unk> .
this is a little teeny <unk> , which is that these two strands are here , is it &apos;s like a <unk> .
here &apos;s two , two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and they were bored , so the captain they went on his deck .
in the <unk> conference , <unk> <unk> , <unk> dense <unk> , <unk> constructed <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> uses a drill to turn into the kids , the kids themselves themselves , and they can build the fundamental principles of science and learning .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually made examples of the biology that many of the world .
and there &apos;s some examples examples of the earliest ecosystems that are capable of imitating .
and then with a little bit , we can put a place of nuclear flu , the open space , the open space , the open space , the open space , the people with food and waste into opportunities .
this photo was taken on saturday , and only one year later , this is what it looked like .
if you take seawater <unk> , the first thing is <unk> .
no , you have to explore the people who are voting with <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i &apos;m looking at somebody who &apos;s been talking about , because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m really important .
but the actual <unk> was very many men who wanted to help me .
very few of us have the ability to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
he likes to clarify long as it &apos;s not a <unk> .
i tried to be in the front of the mind , as a <unk> .
because remember my favorite <unk> : you need to have a <unk> of 700 points , and nobody did this .
most of them are not in the average 33 , not eight years old , not about eight years , not eight years , and if we look at the <unk> of the <unk> of tomorrow , the <unk> of the morning .
so imagine what vision is very good .
these <unk> have contributed many others have contributed to attention to attention to attention to attention to attention to attention to attention to attention to attention to the environment .
i want to ask you to join this result , and it &apos;s going to end up the context of a different group of <unk> , a group that actually has actually high in our society , the alignment of people , the headline .
let me step this step , the mental rotation is called the mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just give all kinds of programs that we &apos;re looking at , running .
so it was a big , very complex project , i couldn &apos;t find sure that it was at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many things .
on a side , we have a <unk> , with the kind of <unk> language , <unk> language and a big network of <unk> <unk> , able to do a few verses .
so , with , physical <unk> , we are used to provide it , and that particular particular sense makes sense sense sense of particular engineering and so on .
i was pretty excited about discovery that there was very excited with stunningly candidates with stunningly simple rules of incredibly simple rules , the sheer thing and the general gases and at least , at least with the quantum evidence .
sw : i think .
and as i actually survived more questions , i actually got more <unk> , and so teachers that worries me , on hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear the red .
my mom was a woman who was no woman , she had no right to the <unk> , which my family owned , was , my dad , he had the right .
and the day was a ceremony of actual ceremony , the actual ceremony was excited , and they didn &apos;t have the whole night .
he was wearing sneakers and a village that didn &apos;t even had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had
i promised him to be a <unk> girl , and everything they would be expected to me .
if it was in the marriage , when it was the mother of the mother &apos;s mother and <unk> .
as we speak , we &apos;re going to talk about 125 , 125 times .
consumers , the 72 percent of the american households , actually , just like the temples and company <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> , their own life , the us that we move forward forward .
and what you see here is the entire phenomenon of fact , is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually <unk> and basically in the point of our households .
<unk> are 48 percent of 48 percent , the cornell <unk> .
we watch a trend to something called <unk> tourism . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and the neighborhood , and the co2 emissions as support .
we also observe a big sample .
the trend is the <unk> .
then we take the hour-by-hour phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i got asked the question , i am the only person , which was something like ?
you could use .
this is what i want to do in my life -- stories today , i want to write with you today , novels today , i want to write with you today , and over some of creatures creatures , the <unk> .
our <unk> could <unk> pumps . our hearts could be used to the hearts , and our <unk> could be avoided , when we first offshore cultural cultural difference .
i then , for the first time i call it , &quot; without a &quot; submission . &quot;
i &apos;m not <unk> , not a one-way street , or <unk> , i &apos;m going to ask , i &apos;m going to do this , but the commute between the languages that allowed me to invent myself .
he wanted to see one of my identity .
my tiny story became an enormous story to a great part because i was prosecuted .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could end up talking about a muslim woman , and maybe a happy story about a muslim woman , and i &apos;ll report about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so you &apos;re faced with you , you take action songs , they put existing existing songs , they put existing existing songs , they get light-activated the same song , but this new song is clearly from old song is clearly from old songs .
instead , these laws and laws worldwide and laws worldwide are comparison .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to show you what it means about : the <unk> of the telephone , by building the symbol of its fingers .
our creativity is coming from the outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you tell your address ? &quot;
in fact , in fact , in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful , you can see this limb there , a kind of <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the extremity of the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to a understanding of the structure , because it &apos;s so <unk> that atoms have a single core core core core , with <unk> , the <unk> .
this painting is a galaxy , a <unk> , , , , , , , , , , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can also recapitulate the <unk> of <unk> ideas , for us to <unk> the <unk> of our place in the universe , and really the value of our transportation .
this is here . this is too . we &apos;re .
and with each other , each of the screen , we &apos;re like <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , our personal information all over the digital woods .
as our daughter , the <unk> , asked me , &quot; she asked , &quot; you will be fighting a school to musical pain ? &quot;
we can &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much , and i was talking about the 27th birthday i decided i couldn &apos;t talk to anymore , just a day .
and you talk about it ?
and i explained to help my advice , who i hate my love was that i was going to be able to live in the &apos; 30s , i couldn &apos;t speak to say that if i was a sign of illegal dignity .
well , i &apos;m going to be <unk> my <unk> .
i started to talk about this because i had missed , <unk> .
but the <unk> was i was i was thinking about my my silence about my my decision , but never just talking about my conscience , just my feet .
and i grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found little jobs in the food supply .
i was constantly worried that i was going to do and back to the .
i felt like this , because i had traveled to food , but my father died was a lot of hunger , but my father died was exhumed .
but i think that their origins of love and also the time of a helicopter ship , and also the lives of a different and thousands other mammal can change the hope that they still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much more stronger than i had expected to make , and as a as as a symbol of <unk> <unk> , to do it .
but then i was very disappointed with my profession , because we don &apos;t help for the society , unless we don &apos;t help society for the society , but for for the future , the government , the government .
and then in the following year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe in kobe .
so i wonder what is a <unk> and what does a <unk> building ?
but this is really cool .
we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we are born in the womb .
so fetuses are even learning the language that are mapped in the world in which they are born in in that .
it &apos;s a mixture of <unk> that are so passionate about how the woman themselves .
why should we be socializing in the womb of disease ?
you can see <unk> , and also with other eyes .
this is what &apos;s the trust in the basin is for any kind of <unk> model .
the audience will weigh <unk> <unk> , which is very often , but not with the <unk> , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , you may be able to smile to smile .
you remember , as the <unk> <unk> , all right , ok , okay , okay .
if you &apos;re a high animal in the middle of the evil and someone says someone says someone says &quot; what does your work in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad ?
this is actually a strategy and not me that strategy is a role .
for me , all the music for me .
so if i can use my software use the camera and the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , and you &apos;ve got a program .
i remember that the poor things -- food , clothing -- eat clothing , &quot; the clothing , &quot; what they didn &apos;t have .
i felt felt even a <unk> of shame .
now , i got it , i was thrilled i was thrilled i was from different reasons .
i was not even cared to a donation that was usually was usually .
it &apos;s about the basin of the history of history and it &apos;s about something of us to engage a possibility that would tell you about a possibility that would be a partnership that was a partnership that &apos;s going to be able to happen .
it &apos;s a widespread <unk> arrangement , a very strong combination .
now , there &apos;s a very first time , and it &apos;s just palpable to honor , for me , for me , that there &apos;s only a vehicle , just a tool .
what does the future humanity humanity ?
now i &apos;m going to ask myself to the second big question : are we alone or elsewhere in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions that show that we &apos;ve done this remarkable in the last 400 years .
see this this .
here &apos;s photographs of me .
the rate of doubling each other , all the 18 months and each of the <unk> white knows is the <unk> act .
but what about you ? what does it do ?
they were paid in their <unk> , and when they did some people for experiments , they would certainly be told .
so we &apos;re interested in things like these things .
the previous generations couldn &apos;t do that experiments .
and i found that the first technology was 120,000 years ago , <unk> <unk> million years ago .
we can learn very much about learning .
and i look at <unk> and try and try and try and try and get alarm alone , not even a minister .
and secondly , they told us that they had a <unk> , but some of the most popular <unk> methods of trees .
so , as now , we came about our ancestors &apos;s visual , because the fossils , the fossils , <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the origins of the world in the <unk> , he talks about how he found the oldest living in africa , and what we can learn to africa .
and if all of the rules should be , you need a system of law , you need a system of law and <unk> because we &apos;ve also got motor to do control .
it &apos;s going to be a high seas , because the continent of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
we need to work on , but also the whole thing .
we need to create a new paradigm of the memory and respect .
carol says , &quot; i would say numbers to do what i do . &quot;
this was an accurate idea .
to say , i &apos;m not a <unk> , so i want to talk about the sketch , so i want to show you a sketch of how the present and the future .
and i think , we need to think about whether we want everybody to think whether we want to think about whether it &apos;s worth of life , and for all of life , and for all of the things .
it looks like the oil .
the fact of complex , they are the strong and <unk> opinion that i think the right solution , no matter what difficult problem is the problem .
cesar and i tried to write a paper for new york times and how it works .
of course , we can do this .
and we deserve a lot of money .
it &apos;s like the <unk> of americans .
we are probably going to be satisfied .
<unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> was always , it never prove to prove the never .
i &apos;m just saying that our approach is not very portable .
china is not going to have been reached 20 years .
we &apos;re not even slow down .
the future is <unk> .
yeah , it &apos;s ugly , and yes , it &apos;s happening -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome more than able to overcome everything , everything that we &apos;re supposed to do .
and here &apos;s where they come in .
and what we need to think about is , if you &apos;re trapped in the flames of the flames , what does next next ?
and we believed , we can take these debt , we &apos;ll have to put this debt on our children .
everything else is <unk> .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what &apos;s called the development of development .
should nothing to be amazing , or ?
all we have to get is <unk> .
they &apos;ll be able to focus on their hearing , you may have the <unk> increase or a series of things we can &apos;t do .
this is not a separate years in the distance .
we should be cheap , simple <unk> ban and don &apos;t get to use them . &quot;
and here &apos;s what we see here .
we can &apos;t touch their trust customers .
it has only 500 to 1,000 , and then to 1,000 dollars . &quot;
and he had a huge jar of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week where they &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of interesting -- things that we &apos;re all talking about -- is <unk> , <unk> slightly less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the web just <unk> 5,000 days .
so , if we say that machine is now a decade , a human brain when we look at the rate , a human brain , we look at the rate of this , there &apos;s 30 billion .
now , it &apos;s not as nervous as you do a chart and things that are not part of the web , you &apos;re not part of the web , they &apos;re going to be it . they &apos;re part of the machine .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; people are going to say the <unk> senses . &quot;
it &apos;s going to be able to get on the level of the parts or words , if you want to want to get .
the last thing i was talking about about the idea that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
third , it &apos;s more ubiquitous going to be able to restore our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was confident , confident , i was confident , it was rejected by the second largest <unk> , and i was going to have been tested in the god and had been to become his <unk> .
these are the most primitive of the <unk> .
and it allows everything . it &apos;s all <unk> .
i &apos;m going to start with some basic ideas like we were going to do things like .
this is a project that we &apos;re just in <unk> for a major <unk> , which is directly from this process , which is the result of a variety of forces that it can .
and this was the end directly directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false , attitude , because it &apos;s probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how this idea is the illusion for the future states .
and then , the most interesting projects projects projects -- a <unk> .
everybody &apos;s been going to be a neighbors .
as we have to pay for extraterrestrial numbers .
so we have a big brain , a huge advantage , because we can modify our environment .
my story , the two brains , is the two brains . it &apos;s a surprise , our gut pesticide is a <unk> brain .
this is very important , very important , is very important , because there &apos;s a <unk> .

the other half of the audience may not be written -- from the other , cultural , cultural , , they may have been optimized for boring -- and find another thing to do much more interesting -- to make a lot more practical .
you can think about two types of thinking about it .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
returning to more , to be <unk> , because you &apos;re busy with uncertainty .
and just at a percent .
he <unk> : &quot; i suppose that , &quot; i suppose you &apos;re going to get to a sudden another one in the family of a family &apos;s coming in the family . &quot;

we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can put the third dimension .

and in the year we &apos;re going to get the full of these trends , and you have to get the full of this trends , and you have to get to the conclusion of technology , and faster , when we get to this point .
you can go and <unk> with .

<unk> argument that it &apos;s fun to work in these big adventures , isn &apos;t entirely talking to my experience .
or : nice . you know , my grandmother is a <unk> in antarctica .
so , the whole purpose of the presentation that the slope that they invest in the basement , they invest in the basement and a lot of money that are going to be .
and to create the experience of trying to create a company or something -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a business .
there &apos;s no dispute about the fact that there was no trouble .
from the time you &apos;re with -- on a solid pathway , whereas a <unk> pathway .
if i know my heart , which is so a device -- the way that is this device .
no , they &apos;re not .
and then they give me a quick sample .
even though the competition after the wright .
it was hopefully all positive , positive , positive , positive , nor positive , positive , nor positive , positive , nor positive , positive , nor positive , nor positive , nor positive .
if you follow my researcher , you &apos;ll get a <unk> , very data-driven presentation , which is the great , who are they are and to be emotionally emotionally emotionally .
i didn &apos;t know that that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically seen is one of them a beetle .
if you &apos;re something that you might have a strong way to have a good way .
and if you &apos;ve got enough to have enough enough , you can click a extra link .
we are at the end of the table as the culture , the innovation , innovation .
so as we think we do , and we act our <unk> .
we have a <unk> meme , seriously .
but forgive me , forgive me , the problems are not the issues of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very empowered .
our think about is backwards .
by a <unk> change , change , like , change , change , change , change , change , change , change , , , and collaboration , and collaboration , these things are on outcomes .
because only the only way is the only way that the things always will be always done , the only way for us , the only way to the old <unk> , and new creative solutions for solving the most important solutions .
because we cannot do it . we should do it together . we should do it together , and if we share that ideas of play , we can create bulgaria .
the magazine is called <unk> , i guess innovation .
my master took me to <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> .
after i had to show you with a <unk> aside , she was very , and i was working there for six months about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know , all of the stuff .
my kids , <unk> and <unk> .
we <unk> <unk> magazines , and we looked at what we looked at , but we looked at what we looked at how we were surrounded by images of images like this .
this painting was literally in seconds after my baby &apos;s pumped into the arms , and i was welcomed with the arms .
rg : oh oh .
av : : 2,000 : no number three : &quot; the miscarriage don &apos;t talk -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general idea is that every aspect of my life is even better than that every aspect of my life is going to become the ted of birth and family planning .
but you realize that you can mix with a <unk> , which is how we &apos;re working on , our life is very much sense , our lives is very much sense of the life is , and what is truly satisfying meaning and what is bigger .
rg : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all this <unk> <unk> , &quot; the <unk> .
imagine big , they already know how they were waiting , they would play , like mountains , they would like to play john <unk> walker , like mountains and <unk> , you can analyze the exact <unk> and <unk> analyze , to analyze it on <unk> wings .
well , since then , since then , since we &apos;ve had a time of the eu , the longest story of the longest <unk> genome in history history .
but now , a couple of months later , as good as politicians should be without activating the power without activating the power without activating the power without the power , &quot; how do someone can modify their wounds , they can &apos;t break their insecurity .
well , i didn &apos;t really understood that , until i have a time , the back , a time , the back of <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> man , <unk> <unk> .
but interestingly , this includes a future of capitalism , like you create a few more <unk> innovation in society , which is like increasing innovation in the society , and it &apos;s going to try to make things , and then those who are working , and then <unk> .
i want to show you today , some surprising new approach of surprising new findings that i &apos;ve worked on the topic of language between the structure of language , which they talk about , and their breakthrough .
and if i want to talk to speak , there &apos;s always true about this .
well , this is a <unk> theory .
so , you ask this device , you can get your hand hand , so i can measure your <unk> .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in the game for the last decade .
i don &apos;t need to tell you how important is to communicate about generations .
we &apos;re teaching teaching them constantly constantly .
but i &apos;m against it , they &apos;re going to use a barrier .
but they got not the results they wanted .
at the same time , i was on the field of the <unk> , i was inducted , i was a ph.d. in <unk> .
humans and <unk> and the birds , and birds , the red line is there , these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused more maslow for serious <unk> and the power of the future and the power of the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this is the party , and -- you can see how it can just see how it can just see how it can just be automated , and you can see everybody &apos;s like everybody .
and he was just like the people who were buddhist in the india at the time .
and he goes to the <unk> man to village .
and he has to be his eyes , it &apos;s so popular , the <unk> and everything .
the animals are in a of your own people . people are people .
we &apos;re looking at the time . we take the emotion of a mother and a long living in that meditation .
and you think , as <unk> things are things that are things that are things that they &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and <unk> .
although , although it &apos;s also a change in the design in the attitude of other creatures , they feel that new quality quality quality , and it serves them as a problem .
so the babies , or the cup of opinion , one of the <unk> of the public health investment .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we have recently heard of bill gates .
so it &apos;s very easy to read it , like it &apos;s supposed to read .
well , let me just let me just give you four <unk> , a example , and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to announce you with detail , but in the lower right-hand corner , you see an example of what we &apos;ve done .
did you start to do this ?
and then , then there &apos;s the <unk> after the things that what determines the things that our new kinds of organization , which is what our new kinds of organization : how do we do ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of the things that will be less likely to be less , it &apos;s going to be in partnerships with the <unk> .
let &apos;s take astronomy , astronomy that yochai has had already had .
it &apos;s also <unk> , professional arguments .
so it &apos;s not a dispute of the two wars , but between these <unk> , it &apos;s all interesting interesting positions of the interesting positions of the interesting positions , which is the people &apos;s going to be about .
this costs about 100 dollars .
and then the people started to get their <unk> and actually has a team that was a team that could be : between new and spain .
and the first thing i thought , was , was , i was trying to thank him .
but the truth is , is that life is right here .
so , you get people and have news like this one .

why should this really play a role ?
so , in theory , we can grow up to each other organ .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the most of the character .
if the power of the same speed , the robot .
and you see , how is the control .
and he &apos;s doing this , he &apos;s going to be <unk> .
they take their neighbors .
this shows that we can double the <unk> , the way , we can make the <unk> , , where we can see them to form teams , as you can see here .
but the robot can also find out where it wants .

i hope he doesn &apos;t .
the film is based on a <unk> of <unk> scott <unk> .
two <unk> were involved in the project : the project , warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to set up the gastric and technology .
we we we we &apos;re going to capture the way we were talking about .
the number of things are going to be happy .
and these are the data you get this data , and then the model for the model .
and this was the finished image that was used in the movie .
this was a very , very early .
and we found this , in the state .
and has a <unk> .
people are going to be used these hypothetical , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , where they lived in their lives .
we were too <unk> -- two of drivers , and imagine that the vast majority is a ocean , that &apos;s a ocean from sand , 40 degrees fahrenheit .
i think that &apos;s the most best <unk> animal in the world . &quot;
and they use them like we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another excerpt .
i don &apos;t get to my body 40 degrees fahrenheit -- enough -- enough to turn a prototype to a prototype .
<unk> , thank you .
start a meeting with a poem , and this is an idea of idea .
but how would you multiply it , if you were never knew how to god like a liberal god , your shoulders , their shoulders , their shoulders , or they were sitting down , or they &apos;re sitting down , or they &apos;re sitting down with your little <unk> ?
who could sleep in this night ?
but , you know , judy <unk> dollars a movie has paid a film , <unk> <unk> <unk> the french <unk> to the roadrunner , and blaise pascal pascal had pledged the french speed of the victory -- no , i mean , i mean , he &apos;s going to be the calculator ?

a component of this is the understanding of the understanding , and here &apos;s a <unk> , &quot; the ability to understand the senses and sharing . &quot;
so now we investigate the <unk> expressions of expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test is not good for them .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher was even , that it was impossible to be impossible to be a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in french revolution .

over the years , the serious <unk> can do <unk> .
a.j. jacobs : how the healthy life almost led to me almost live in almost a third of

a man was a tank ago , a picture of a painting that &apos;s the entire world in a symbol of the article .
but what would you have not even done anything to do if they have explained to create the modern consequences that was wrong against the wrong that &apos;s wrong with a sense of time , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , immediately , a sense of thinking about something ?

the <unk> <unk> <unk> , as a <unk> algae .
boy : <unk> .
we &apos;re going to see the spines in action .
in a long time , tech , one remarkable engineer , the remarkable engineer , a remarkable engineer , the remarkable engineer , the one remarkable engineer , where he &apos;s going to launch in a artificial foot .
you see almost like from aliens . and the secret , what they &apos;re going to measure their <unk> toes toes toes toes .
so here we pull the band-aid off the band-aid .
this recursive structure allows to allow the spines , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , spontaneous &apos;s <unk> .
so , as create a new <unk> , as a <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , like a contractor to choose each other and an mate .
so , if you &apos;re more than 20 feet , you have to create less than half of the time , you need less than half of the time .
if we think about how dolphins are we think about the consequences of our interventions that we have to be the implications of our modern ideas that we have to be right .
after the <unk> , the only one of the <unk> was accessible to experience the systems to learn what scientists were going to .
they just hear the low .
if you get male and females use this signal , you find an mate and they &apos;re facing , which was what impacts this impacts of the most popular species .
how could you do , you can become that with a better <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that may be reduced by 2020 .
they <unk> the speed of 50 percent .
we &apos;re blind worlds , we see , we see , you see , strangers , 300 , 300 , and it &apos;s going to be more . and they &apos;re not like we &apos;re .
you have all of the possibilities .
we &apos;re seeing a continuous increase in the men .
and clearly there &apos;s clearly one , the hundred .
with initiatives like 100 dollars laptop , <unk> , it &apos;s me thinking about this , that we &apos;re going to determine a whole new generation of people in the old computer computers .
thank you .
i think nothing of the problem is the problem .
our our our system is affecting the , <unk> said , in a state state , we say in a state state , we say in a <unk> .

but we are much more .
part of the challenge of the challenge was a lot of <unk> -- but the rhythm of my body -- but the rhythm of my body -- but the rhythm of my body and the <unk> and the balls and the balls with my brain .
and then they play crazy .

and then , all right , and then it &apos;s just a little number over time .
with the room and tuned in other ways .
and then <unk> den .
in this year -- scientists are scientists -- scientists are we going to put the <unk> on this year , we &apos;ve got to design at the <unk> around us .
we can fold this on a <unk> , needing more information about the brain , more information about the brain , whereas you &apos;re going to put these <unk> .
twenty-five adams : i &apos;ve been found on the way to be the <unk> in the <unk> .
and we also give a new product , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s going to be shown .

if google is a book , you get it into a very nice format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , the middle of the 40s was remembered .
but , imagine you , it &apos;s probably interested in .
but also , many of the right , the apparently apparently the seemingly apparently the seemingly .

if i drop this ingenious sound for longer than a few minutes , they would literally stop it .
many people visited themselves , but this is big , public spaces , public spaces , public spaces , in millions of personal , in millions of personal <unk> .
they can do that , you can do it .
and then the end , a <unk> .
and i wonder , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you that you &apos;re here . we &apos;re all grateful . &quot;
and they went away .
because they weren &apos;t showing us on the grid and couldn &apos;t see the exchange of my camera and my <unk> , a exchange , a exchange , the most exciting .
well , i &apos;m going to tell you , in the last year , last year , in the last year , because the arab spring is the arab spring is still being a <unk> , <unk> ?
this photo was actually a <unk> in a mud , and they see the <unk> of the people who have been hearing .
the kids just just just took photographs in a class , the teacher you gave them on the throttle .
in the middle today , it &apos;s about the brain and the greek , , somewhere there &apos;s a loaner .
this is something that we can do in our lifetimes , and i was thankful i can see a difference and so i was going to be out of the <unk> , and the <unk> that &apos;s going to come on .
but sometimes science has science , which really interesting really interesting .
what do we bring us more data ?
there &apos;s something that we think is obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator not in a human mind .
in humans , we have the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the neocortex , part of the neocortex , nature has this little trick .
it &apos;s not that they &apos;re going to say , and say , what i see ?
not like a <unk> . not in the slightest .
these are the things that first gets first .
we need something we need some police , we need some military , but just to defense .

this group of cut three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
she has managed to learn english and learn to learn about foreign learning .
the computer , and in a from three , the three of us .
if , if you think they were the only one of our <unk> because the fact that actually works in fact , we didn &apos;t exactly what we did .
we took the same experiment with the same thing , but a constant debate between the same thing , but a constant one between the data , and the actual beginning of the <unk> .
the price is the the displacement from the paradise .
and they &apos;re spinning and join and they would have to embark on their hands and <unk> .
we &apos;re really good to talk about skills and safety , we &apos;re really trying to talk about the perfect , to talk about character .
then imagine what happens to the <unk> against the bad breath against the bad breath .
i feel not really lucky .
the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to learn other people , connecting other people , and find out what they &apos;re going to do .
they own <unk> powder .
this is it , which is the subconscious .
we found them between <unk> , raped , many men , many men , i don &apos;t know how many of men , i don &apos;t know how many of men , i don &apos;t know how many of men , i don &apos;t know how many of men , i don &apos;t know how many of men , i don &apos;t know how many of men , i don &apos;t know how many of men , i don &apos;t know how many of men , i don &apos;t know how many of men , i don &apos;t know
where does your journey ?
and it &apos;s not normal , in a home .
what &apos;s got my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : the same theme of the dictionaries .
now , i &apos;m going to admit , i &apos;m tuned to queen of blame , because it &apos;s funny .
dictionaries need to be different .
the bad words -- you see if somebody &apos;s a place and find it not on the map , then it doesn &apos;t think , &quot; this map is the problem ! &quot;
they think , &quot; ok , if we are asking our thoughts that we use to do our thoughts that we are using our thoughts are better better than hammer ?
the <unk> dylan has 33 <unk> definitions of definitions .
and then there &apos;s mike <unk> : mike <unk> lives in britain .
i &apos;ve all the time , the dictionary that would dictionary , the dictionary that will be the dictionary . &quot;
so , i &apos;m going to chair .
and to make a long story short , i &apos;m here .
and by with it , play for the play , during this three days , they starts to say , why do i hear all this <unk> stuff ?
they may be maybe a ted speaker , and so we can put the conversation during the year , and next year , and next year , and emotional journey .
the manufacturer are not in their cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not sure what the public was going to start with a <unk> , which was actually going to start to start counting the palm fold on the palm .
there was one of the whether that was was about , and not able to be able to find a <unk> .
instead of trying to do the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> and we live in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the power of a <unk> people .
we debating the world , what the world needs now is nuclear -- is nuclear power &quot; -- right ?
and so , until now , there are only three discrete <unk> -- coal , <unk> , the almost 300 miles -- and nuclear nuclear .
we are the russian horses in the power of the land , by drilling in power .
<unk> emissions are <unk> emissions of all the gray and the particles , the yields and co2 .
if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons emissions , because we know that india and pakistan , we know , the india and pakistan , by <unk> by <unk> in <unk> .
for wind , the area is much larger , but the <unk> is small .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , or ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of the support of the support -- only one or two voices are required to the global economy , and this room can help help .
we &apos;re not only from renewables not get enough energy .
i used to worry about the 10th years ago .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was donated by the apollo .
for the first time , we have stockpiled enough wealth in the hands of some people , and the limitations of technology that we &apos;re going to talk about the disparity of the space .
26 groups of seven countries in the competition , each had been a few million dollars between one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can bring them to the space .
and the advantage for the crucial is the sum of the <unk> and the civic <unk> .
would you make us a sense of our own , ourselves ?
that means that surfaces can function , can try and can be incredibly small .
a challenge was , how we actually put this new algorithmic blood flow in a space .
what i didn &apos;t know , because we just had just documenting the the outside , because we just had just documenting the surfaces within the park , within the park .
instead of the cell algorithms michael <unk> algorithms , and not a person could create a person with millions of surfaces , not a person could create a human , very human , but you can build our understanding of architecture of architecture .
so , look at this slide here -- a lot of forms here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that &apos;s developed for cancer .
you can see that the chip <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that are being turned by young people .
and i think there are many people here in the room , many of them are in the same position like me .
so i think i was going to be able to recognize that it &apos;s important to be a future generations , because they &apos;re interested in our own generations .
we &apos;ve recognized that , for more people like youtube and social networks are using their photographs , their photographs , their photographs , their photographs and their own stories with your own voices .
biologist , we invite them a <unk> , and our part of the world .
i was more or less than anything . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do this ants , some of the apartments , you pull them a . &quot;
this was called &quot; house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i had been finished , i came back to the next day .
and it was raining .
my work , , , , , , sometimes five weeks ; it can &apos;t anticipate , six weeks ; they can &apos;t anticipate .
and i &apos;ll put it on , and they &apos;re shaped the <unk> .
so i was called the needle .
it &apos;s a very selfish work , but the best things come in small <unk> .
they expect their employees , they do what they asked the job , if they were doing the job , they can do that job .
there &apos;s absolute concentration of that , this absolute of his consciousness , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , a lawyer is the primary attributes of the divine .
my <unk> body flew into the palm , my <unk> bike into the other .
i i i i i i i i i &apos;m going to try to do all the <unk> that i &apos;m not going to talk to you , the <unk> that i couldn &apos;t get to go to them , and i couldn &apos;t go to them .
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you &apos;re interrupted from behind the future , you can just encounter them , and it makes you <unk> in the dirt . &quot;
20 years ago , the physicians took me off my leg and hoped there , there was a 15 <unk> .
and as i was more about more and more and i was probably 14 pounds of times when i &apos;m now .
and no one thought that modern <unk> <unk> in my eyes , more than david black .
now , , you know , you &apos;re going to tell the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s the <unk> of the international <unk> , which is the least <unk> name is <unk> name is the most mind-boggling name of the name is the least <unk> name is the least <unk> name is the least <unk> name is the least <unk> name is the least <unk> name is that i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born in three months and early months and it was really a fantastic specimen .
so , when i was trying to crack why i was trying to get hurt .
and then , on the end of you , you would have no problem that things like the days &quot; no problem , isn &apos;t it ?
would you like me play me ?
dp : &quot; tiger <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t have this .
they &apos;re fighting your own decisions in this forest , in a world , which is still , in a world that &apos;s still , a world that didn &apos;t have the even yet .
we know why they &apos;re capable of accomplishment that the research has been impossible to totally impossible to the research , as i started .
the long run to date in the long words , the <unk> , which is during this long childhood , and also the the wireless lives , and it can be carried to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and the vast majority of the <unk> in the forest , now the the <unk> camp now , and so that the pygmies in the <unk> , and there &apos;s the pygmies in their wonderful way , so many years have lived in their wonderful way .
yesterday , somebody said that somebody .
there &apos;s now in every state of every state , and the problems are others than the new york .
do you come up and down to me here ?
there &apos;s out there in politicians ?
what we want to do in the lab , is so much the same thing , but with a few dozen of different kinds of molecules -- such as a <unk> , but yet the trial , to create something more .
it &apos;s even very <unk> , if they &apos;re subtly even though they &apos;re not really something .
now , where all of the experts are going to play with these protocells .
we &apos;re looking at the self-assembly of <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black integrate the same -- that we &apos;ve seen before -- these <unk> , very complex , , organic black sludge .
in his lab , martin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the referral of chemicals that behave like living cells , which behaved like living cells , which behaved first could be first described to be first in the earth , and maybe elsewhere .
this is a <unk> to lead your tadpole to the night .
what &apos;s the -- where did they know ? they &apos;ve got it .
but if we were going to fill this at each other -- every time we &apos;re redefining the economy .
and the most fundamental issue is the same person who is otherwise in their home , <unk> , and the <unk> in the field of connection .
the birds were from another jump to another .
they can just give you a <unk> of einstein . they can talk to him .
but this herd , will keep a big tribute of our planet .
next we we isolate , we isolate the skin and multiply them in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been doing for thousands of years , starting to start with <unk> , start beer and <unk> .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re going to see our place where we &apos;re seeing our camera in the world , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal quest to a car .
let me just take you to the hydrogen .
this is a huge disconnect , energy , mobile energy .
if we can see this scaling future , and then other people .
you had to survive .
and we &apos;re sure to be able to be able to get our research and support .
because why should our students get parental away from your way ?
it became a book , then a demo .

i &apos;ll show you why .
they have to have been two pictures of the time , &quot; the cultivation of <unk> <unk> of for them , &quot; for them , &quot; what would you would like this ? &quot;

and bmw is a very smooth car .
the problem for bmw , this car is certainly .
now you &apos;ll think , &quot; if my life depended on the ground . &quot;

you know , if you &apos;re going to keep on .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we don &apos;t have transition unless we didn &apos;t have to invent this whole new evolutionary infrastructure to invent the first time .
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced . and the conscience that they play , play , to the games , which is so much that they play , so that you can &apos;t see what the actual words is fairly evident .
in fact , there &apos;s five states that are worse , and really only four states that this was not unique to stand .
and even if you &apos;re just like , you could get there .
it should be more like private .
but i had a <unk> , when i went to visit <unk> , and i was a <unk> in my life , and i was trying to decide between music and medicine .

but they &apos;re all the market , and what the market is actually going to be a big issue of all -- number one one &apos;s the big demographic .
we also have lots of examples of the elderly of the natural communities , which has been transformed in all sorts of big social and many , many of churches , and many of many many , like this one .
and finally , i &apos;ve got to see that the streets are driven by the dimming .

i &apos;ve been thinking about beauty about beauty that they &apos;re complaining about yesterday , which they &apos;re in his book , and there &apos;s been in his book that means that , after all the book , that &apos;s been in his book that means that , after all the book , that &apos;s been in his book that means that , after all the book , that &apos;s been in his book that means that , after all the book , that &apos;s been in his book that means that could possibly be able to make .
george : what the defense of our safety , costs , and what the defense of our freedom , we have to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , not a tasmanian astronomer in the world , and the idea was very few astronomers -- the other one of the outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems in the world are truly ecosystems in danger .
he &apos;s constantly constantly constantly constantly constantly constantly that a experiment with a different and a holistic connection that the world .
we need to be treated with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology with biotechnology
so one of the way that we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do ?
and now the worst thing .
we use lots of money to ensure that we don &apos;t die at a one-way child , but we don &apos;t give you nowhere , and yet it &apos;s totally preventable .
we don &apos;t want to be back to the wrong feet .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
this is very important , because this is the system that the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of life on the planet . and it &apos;s now time to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing realization . and we know that we know about it .
and this is what the system is <unk> , a number of <unk> in the south hemisphere in the south hemisphere in these circles .
everybody who can just get to the database , and can make the information that just needed to be able to be able to happen for everything .
we &apos;re interested in the wave of the world , the technological possibilities .
at the earthquake , huge landscapes that we never saw before new landscapes that we never saw before .
biologist john <unk> creates a network of <unk> and sensors that our oceans , the our oceans , the our oceans , interactive lab -- and then a <unk> of a <unk> of the depth of the deep sea .
so i think that optimism architecture is going forward .
so , again , radical against conservative .
the <unk> <unk> against the owners . they know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
our intellectual desires are complex .
they know , it &apos;s true ; the when unexpected , as unexpected , it &apos;s unexpected .
but i &apos;m going to play something completely , and even with the mistakes , instead of thinking , instead of its own .
the most of you haven &apos;t been as manageable as they should be in an easy city .
there &apos;s the emotion of the victims .
daniel libeskind , it &apos;s called the big ideas . he &apos;s called the 17 <unk> , the his vision of architecture , the his vision of architecture -- and so inspirational , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical , radical ,
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the cars .
so , if something really really really sucks , or it &apos;s just a few <unk> ?
em : it just just to say , if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
and with the capital and the corals , the <unk> on the roof , or <unk> , a product that is the <unk> or <unk> , a product that is lower , is the lower is the bottom is the bottom .
we are very appreciative , but we &apos;re close to the outward world .
it &apos;s like like a jet propulsion .
how to communicate all in the world could be innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you &apos;re our livestock , and a cheetahs of flow as a <unk> , it &apos;s very nervous , and then just go very nervous .
we &apos;re going to starvation .
our tradition is : in every tradition : in every time , there &apos;s a disconnect fire .
so we &apos;ve also been able to fund the world , fund the <unk> , the very small <unk> to <unk> .
even though we invest in enlightenment , we invest that money in the enlightenment , and hiv .
<unk> -- is a <unk> among the world of the <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful .
and we created our prize behind the wild .
dan <unk> , alice <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> for food cream .
<unk> , <unk> , oysters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that were the most pervasive species .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
the science is the world through the minds , and can be measured , and can be avoided , but they can make the art and knowledge .
from the plan of a couple of cameras , a few cameras , a plan with 25 <unk> .
this is the natural thing .
it would usually not <unk> photographer to <unk> a photograph of <unk> , right ? and so , the words ? but sometimes that &apos;s why sometimes to be the dimensions of the dimensions .
here &apos;s what you see , as the tail back back .
this is several cameras .
could you could be india to be a free center for innovation , just like a global heart is for <unk> and <unk> ?
if we &apos;re in in a conversation with these <unk> saying , they said , &quot; they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
they can &apos;t be a professor if they were able to deal with .
the best hospitals that would be hospitals in the doctors , and then , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , heart disease , for artificial <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s also a bit like -- this is a <unk> <unk> backup for four .
i said , i know , i know , &quot; i know , if i see a <unk> message .
each one in our company , in touch -- if not there , through a person , then by a very basic human , a colleague , a colleague , a fellow , a fellow , a fellow .
in this <unk> , the genetic material , the chromosome , the chromosome , inside a pool .
we have tumor treating fields in the lab at the time , and we see this effect in the way .
he got the <unk> .
but what we see is that in the ancient state of the tumor , and he &apos;s beginning to <unk> .
this is just the beginning .
this is a new version , a new project .
in fact , they are 15 feet long , and collect the roof of the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their .
so , water is 300 miles , soon it looks like this .
somewhere somewhere is a stream or a <unk> through this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they have to be further .
these are the beautiful string onto the time that we saw on a mirror .
and <unk> are the 27 refugees , : 600,000 people have a thousand tedtalks in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in the room that people from the <unk> and they &apos;re on the way toward the way and prosperity in the way and prosperity in the way , and prosperity .
and the countries in the right , you see the <unk> . in principle , every country with a <unk> of , say , less than 5,000 dollars , we say less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of we say three three .
in first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s , 70s , didn &apos;t get resolved .
buy african products .
but i think that a lot more powerful problem with a much greater problem , which is that we ipods ipods and not to be bombs , it would mean , it would be amazing <unk> new book .
they have 500 people in 500 people , and four of them have been chosen to come to visit the and so to be able to climb it .
now , today , in the course of course , citizens in the planning not necessarily not necessarily anything anything , because it &apos;s still the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : the internet produces the internet <unk>
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he &apos;s hanging with us with us .
because for me , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and in this <unk> , &quot; or drugs , &quot; should you want sex or drugs -- and we didn &apos;t have a gps .
i was like , people .
as indians , and now , politicians and <unk> , i &apos;m pretty much about india than new <unk> , which is concerned about india than new <unk> , in fact , all the new superpower .
and in other words , all kinds of stories about countries , independent of them , independent of them want to know if they &apos;re the oil or not .
but the <unk> in our country , at our country , at the time , it took me about half an hour , a telephone hour .
it can &apos;t understand the dialogues .
this can have felt amazing consequences . ok .
and these guys who have been sniffing , you may be surprised , to see , how many of the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> .
i went home home and i was a little bit of statistics , and i found some autistic statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a puppy designer pulling water
and i feel like george bush bush .
well , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , a early critic , and this is a passage that i just like to read you , and i would like to read them .
and this is a good thing , because if it &apos;s so , as if it &apos;s so , mother nature has a problem : how to mate all in the world , we get chimpanzees ?
this is the hardest part that &apos;s not obvious , is , not obvious , and so i &apos;ve therefore been it for the launch .
ok ? stop . the bottom of the time .
i don &apos;t know why there are <unk> , but don &apos;t matter , they &apos;re there in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i suspect that the most controversial reasons probably know , many reasons , why we &apos;re going to talk new things , really like to want to really quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should just see this as a look at the point .
bob mckim has another very different -- another version of this practice was done in a fairly famous experiment in the 1960s .
and we have this with the time , you get a much better more better than that , much more creative outcomes , if all the rules .
and suddenly , there was a conversation about design around a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to come back .
you know , how does it feel like , all of these things , as you get in the corridor of the corridor , as you can take back into a <unk> case , and you wonder what &apos;s happening here .
and so i would all feel secure , and would have a good time because we feel about the rules and so that rules about the rules and it would be happy .
we do everything , what success does , but then , if we &apos;re there , we think we &apos;ve done it , we think we &apos;ve done it , and just just just just just just just the way , all that what we did .
i was faster , but just as much as the size .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the <unk> is just full of <unk> . &quot;
i wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully my god , &quot; hopefully , always , the last time in the public .
he made sure that everything .
it &apos;s a 900 people in part .
and the second is that people are going to experience a actual connection .
these are questions .
how enduring modern liberal liberal liberal liberal liberal liberal liberal liberal , the state of the state , not just our self , our self , but it &apos;s also requires us from us .
it means that we &apos;re our potential potential potential .
so these are the layers of questions , which i &apos;m going to ask you today -- the question : what are the intentions that &apos;s intentions , which is what &apos;s application about application , if you design something ?
so i was so happy , and my colleague <unk> us that it has to be better practices .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you a quick thing .
he <unk> them in the right position , they <unk> her nose to the nose .
we learned the first surprise .
it had to be a kind of <unk> to create the amount of <unk> , to create the speed of the system that we &apos;re seeing and the <unk> of the system .
a load viral powers forces , and this is actually a <unk> experiment in inner in inner .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be able to put and put on the load .
a very , very <unk> solution for the particular problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , it &apos;s ocean .
i think this is one of the most basic classic classic <unk> that were built .
i don &apos;t know the other <unk> , not even <unk> that just just the three-dimensional space .
now you see this -- it &apos;s just standing .
the submersible that &apos;s last year , was this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , -- please excuse them -- not the actual approach that we need to vote .
in conjunction , they built the back of the <unk> , the holocaust , our streets on their shells .
in these eight modalities , these jarring <unk> , put little <unk> that are virtually practical <unk> .
so , you &apos;re going to talk about in london and the was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
finally , the map of the convention .
and this is every second week .
i &apos;ve been on the top of the <unk> .
and in this field of the amazon , oil was discovered with the oil fields .
the other side of the brain is <unk> <unk> , where actually does it , in fact , in fact , in fact , of course , &quot; this is <unk> .
this was one of the big <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me move ahead and you create the hubble <unk> deep .
but then you get to jupiter , and the is 40 minutes , far away . that &apos;s a problem .
this is the part of the part that it &apos;s going to understand the understanding of the universe .
we have only a million galaxies .
so , the stuff that is invisible , dark matter .
when you first saw this picture , you can &apos;t see a lot of them in it .
this simulation was with 1,000 processors with 1,000 processors , just just to make this visible .
with onboard , we might a look at a resolution that &apos;s about this slide of earth , you can actually see the complicated of the earth &apos;s complicated .
and in the aftermath of course , we are busy .
forty-seven percent .
this is crazy . we &apos;re constantly constantly constantly constantly constantly constantly constantly in the everyday life .
i literally literally , in a vicious vicious cycle , and i think , and i think , almost nothing couldn &apos;t hold more .
i asked me , so i could be creative , if you put it up with intention ?
this whole thing is not about today .
the mystery of <unk> is , <unk> , <unk> , like a <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
stalin &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> , killing millions of <unk> , killing millions of <unk> , killing millions of <unk> , killing millions of <unk> , <unk> , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . many of the women were trafficked .
the size of the globe is . &quot;
and as a <unk> ambassador , i think we learned what we learned in the world , what we learned in the world , and we spend our identity , for our identity , for a better life live in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life in life life
we &apos;ve been trying to be alone .
human relationships are logarithmic , chaotic and <unk> .
it &apos;s called it .
because in the moment , in which people are alone , even for a few seconds , they &apos;re going to <unk> , , they get bored to an electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger because in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact ,
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently apparently , we don &apos;t seem to have any of the <unk> of the <unk> , which means of our students predicted , and quite often , very often , very often , very often , i had predictions of predictions in the landscape .
maybe because we had my dad was always .
so i went to the envelope , but then you had to be the way you had to be .
finally , i thought i &apos;m going to be missing the time , right here .
even though , although , you lose , not a afraid of failures , when we took everything , because who can can make a difference from a human more desire than anything that .
if i &apos;m going to call the name , i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to answer .
did i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge was <unk> .
today , today , today , today , in many ways of stem cells for heart disease .
just just last month , it &apos;s been us with this technology to show human <unk> .
we can analyze them and the 360 degrees and to analyze the kidney degrees , and so the kidney degrees in all of their <unk> , then we can take this information and then break apart .
i couldn &apos;t get to school , just just like a minute .
i was a kid , i said that i want to do , &quot; i want to do . i want to say this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new field system developed , called the <unk> .
and connected with this <unk> , there &apos;s examples across the world -- from the choice of a president to <unk> wikipedia and everything else -- that showed that showed that force could achieve a lot of the force .
third , <unk> , <unk> environmental issues .
because what you need to do this , is not the drill .
i don &apos;t want to make sure i want to play the music that you &apos;re playing .
i was great joseph and stumbled in kenya .
we need to have our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to augment infrastructure .
in night , i went back to the batteries and ice .
: did anyone get <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , the south of the south pacific and in the work on the local , and in the work on this .
but this can be huge , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers , the <unk> of x volunteers , the <unk> of the <unk> of the city , the city .
they have <unk> , sexual <unk> and data .
so , these are the 18 minutes , the ones that allowed me to talk between between and <unk> people who were going to be in cities .
and he was retreating in a violinist called mud . sludge .
the buildings here have several stories here .
these green things are the foreground .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ve got to activities on the other political activities .
i couldn &apos;t couldn &apos;t let me be part of technological revolution that would be that if the dream was going to be .
think about it , these men who have not the same as the same as i was able to create through their support support , <unk> <unk> .
at the time , <unk> , only one acrylic , but by <unk> , he could he <unk> a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , he could read a machine that could read .
but you know , i find it very lonely , and i read from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books about the border , in different versions of versions countries , in different parts of the financial countries , in different versions of versions of versions of the harry potter novels .
the <unk> <unk> , because lifespan has doubled more than doubled and they increase it with a speed of five hours .
one last thing , i wish , you wish , ok ?
secondly , the new machine is a new machine confronting such as good news , because once the androids work , we need to do more and <unk> .
the social challenges of how this inequality should be addressed .
the economic playbook is surprising and surprisingly , especially in the short term .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world of creating with <unk> technologies , in a slightly more <unk> society , and also through a economy that creates inequality .
i started to feel the other <unk> with the notion of god .
some people have estimated that we can only get to a god who &apos;s going to be the our same .
in the second time , the line comes out of the wind and found it .
so who &apos;s god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the implications of the universe .
by looking at the god in the van in the van in the body . i mean my own <unk> .
one of the first things i was trying to explore , was the history of the helicopter &quot; technology . &quot;
we &apos;ve no animators found , the older age were available , but the average age of age , the older age of the hunter-gatherer hunter-gatherer and free tribes , is the same age of 30 years 30 .
our bodies has been used to this new diet .
so this is rooted in energy and matter , the einstein and information science has shown , and the modern science of the <unk> , the entropy and information all relate together , so we all relate to each other , and we all have each other , and we all have each other , so it &apos;s a long .
this is a robot that wants to change its own , to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power to get more power
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re going to look for a new job .
a great development that emerged about years ago , and we disperse and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , really , really , really , we &apos;re ourselves .
they said , &quot; well , you know , we &apos;ve five five classes 30 to 40 of 40 .
we &apos;re <unk> the repeat , <unk> beams beams beams beams <unk> beams <unk> beams <unk> beams <unk> beams <unk> beams <unk> beams beams beams , &quot; what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we &apos;re trying to sit on the tables and we waited .
there &apos;s lots of <unk> , the only problem , especially for the adult <unk> , which was from all of the time when they started to start there was a toilet .
the teachers are working with the ones that we &apos;re working with everything for teachers -- they say what we &apos;re supposed to do .
approximately about 170 of the book , with you , has been working on the book and so it was beautifully .
and right behind -- there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a -- right , they saw them as children taught me .
there &apos;s also this <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see if you take a blank street , but it &apos;s open up .
it &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s got his cousins .
and yet , a email , he &apos;ll get asked to answer every question you want to introduce any question .
i was this girl .
80 percent of the refugees in the world are women women and children . oh . oh .
there &apos;s a side that thinks the end of the shah is , and there &apos;s a side that means is to say that peace is the creation of schools and it means .
she sent her kids to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s one thing that applies to all the time , they know that ?
on the cape region , there &apos;s <unk> roads , and we can all right here .
this is my baby &apos;s <unk> . thank you .
he said , &quot; i &apos;ve got everything . &quot;
and in a sense , i &apos;ve always met so guilty about it .
so i was so much of a <unk> .
i found that the word is very good .
so the final thing is , most of the hardest hard hard .
from all in a weird <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s about a window about a window , which is a window about a window , in the moment , in the midst of my house was black and this <unk> <unk> in the sun .
and i was through the controversy of karen armstrong , remember that religion really understood exactly what really really understood that religion really understood nothing about , but with behavior .
the <unk> , , geographically geographically same size , same size . it doesn &apos;t seem like the same size , but it has exactly the same size , <unk> a little bit like the animal &apos;s arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the lucky .
we cannot wait for the <unk> waiting , the australia has had to change our political culture .
this challenge is the structure of the structure of our civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we have through the presumption of this challenge .
before i show you some of the visuals to investigate this beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
this is the most extraordinary school .
we have now to have keith graduating morning with keith haring <unk> , not to be able to show something beautiful , from fear to show in order to learn about fear , from fear , to show you more than a <unk> .
so here &apos;s examples of that , you are actually using the textiles , which is very interesting .
so that &apos;s going to think more about what robots for us .
no . i had to think about a little sharper .
we did the same thing .
this was a challenge we had to be a physicist .
we can push it up . the powers of the brain region , but there are more of them , but they &apos;re fragile .
&quot; <unk> 7 : a whole band
and there &apos;s some of the proton in the foundations that &apos;s called the <unk> .
the idea of justice , which gives our lives and give us a sense of what &apos;s really important in life , what &apos;s going on in life , what we should do .
and as this is so , it &apos;s called a <unk> during the <unk> .
every week would send the <unk> . &quot; god , you &apos;ve got me back to the . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , a infection , a hot or a operation .
the muscles were developed , <unk> , paralyzed , <unk> , <unk> .
we &apos;re treating them with <unk> drugs -- the ones , frankly , frankly , frankly , frankly , working very effective .
now , you get a sense of how much of the way a lot of robotics .
it was a <unk> . nothing , i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see him from the back of the hind appearance of all , they &apos;re only stars .
in 2005 , nasa was a probe called &quot; deep &quot; deep &quot; the one -- that &apos;s a part of the <unk> of a comet .
these are smart guy -- men and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women -- and women --
the difference between the marshall between the marshall and and we can have a <unk> , and we can have our future , and we can change our future .
and at this time , i &apos;ve been <unk> , the only independent , to be precise , the only medium .
and i thought , <unk> , and a great company that would be if if <unk> could be the <unk> , which is what really means .
and at the end of the bumblebee says , &quot; well , if you &apos;re not going to see , you &apos;re not going to see your money , you &apos;ll see your money to see your money to the table , so you can test .
and we said that -- this is okay , we &apos;re meeting , let &apos;s okay , you know , you know what they &apos;re actually made .
you see , we have a <unk> and <unk> with our work and they &apos;re shipped to russia .
after a while we opened a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea of the idea of the free press .
and so , in fact , you &apos;re faced with the funding , no no no longer exists to find more no no to find out to find yourself .
so , why does it work ? this is the question .
now , some of all , some theory of everything .
just a simple example , &quot; newton &apos;s law , the law of gravity , that works as a result between the footprints between the animal .
the more symmetry you have , the better material gets more simplicity and elegance .
one thing that he thought most of us today , but not until we were able to wake up today , but it was not until not .
it doesn &apos;t matter the meaning of that understanding of the understanding of that understanding that they &apos;re going to follow , and accidents .
but he read in every moment moment , he had books .
and from this ambition , he went into the <unk> .
but when he was just to <unk> his mammogram underneath the <unk> , his hand was deaf and <unk> , and he was <unk> , because he was going to have been a <unk> split up during a <unk> .
not surprisingly , it was only three women under the 16 <unk> of white house .
but i must say , the older i became progressively , the more i i was trying to find what an incredible privilege of a man &apos;s man &apos;s <unk> .
and as lincoln history , the story , all of us after war , all came to britain .
i asked my dad , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what &apos;s the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange of love to history , which allowed me to spend a life in the classroom for the past .
he had the temples and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is the proof that the <unk> is the proof that wipe them in babylon , the proof that wipe them in babylon , the <unk> of the rivers , and the jerusalem that was going to go home .
all of these are man-made .
the <unk> cylinder is covered by the <unk> of the great basin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
you know what that happens .
to see this object in tehran , the thousands of users , , last couple of thousands of weeks , in iran .
some of you know , more about emotion-like , but they think they &apos;re a <unk> .
the newly <unk> was the first few years old age in the first few days , they had not occupied and eventually they weren &apos;t allowed to to become more inclusive , within less days they were <unk> , and start from the air , like all the rest .
a study shows that <unk> percent a cost of a cost of <unk> costs , whereas 30 percent of the 30 percent .
and i was going to be because i had almost had a whole life on a camera .
you know , you know , right , you know , right , you know what you &apos;ve got to find an answer to find .
it was <unk> people there -- most of them friends and family .
we &apos;ve heard every single individual .
but of course , he never occurred . never .
and after many , many meetings was , i was ecstatic , was really excited that man was really a <unk> <unk> , who has been a whistling , and mentors , and mentors , it was done , <unk> .
so he said , &quot; yeah , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and the <unk> , etc , etc -- and she loved him .
we connect with <unk> -- i &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> . i &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> . i said , &quot; honey &apos;s about the .
it &apos;s about their <unk> , requesting .
the biggest brains should be the world should be the cognitively .
i was <unk> the literature after that , but i never never find them .
there &apos;s just a big fibroid .
and amazingly , what our ancestors has been invented a hundred million years ago , as they invented the cooking .
right now , right , right , right for the <unk> of the <unk> , which i did .
and i think i just got straight at the beginning .
but once the most urgent <unk> <unk> , was the physical rehabilitation .
and behind him , a child , son , red , red , red , red wine in the face of effort .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
i was talking to my story in the headquarters headquarters and i said -- i said , &quot; look , we start to told them , &quot; look , we start to start with a few hours , only for some tomorrow . &quot;
two groups of <unk> started to fight .
so i wondered , &quot; what does it do ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the orthopedic , but also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a <unk> .
and this hospital could afford to afford .
why ? because the way i was writing that i was writing .
but i learned something more than that , which is that the leaders -- the managers of the economy -- the managers of the economy -- provided bad decisions that our economy was happening before the collapse .
because i knew that the state of the african health was for the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african health care of the african
i &apos;m trying to experience the experience that i had been in swarthmore , and after africa .
is my my hands ? ok ? ok .
we have a moment that a great society within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s the <unk> detectors , the sun that we draw very , as children .
in fact , this is something that &apos;s something that &apos;s happened to be able to be familiar with more than half , not necessarily .
32 <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . &quot;
and these are the messages that they are receiving ?
because , in the end , the sponsor love , and so it &apos;s going to watch the television .
a professional <unk> , who talks about me , not me ?
what is <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to get suggestions with you how to make <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and conservatives were paid by that they do something .
thank you .
so that &apos;s why this entire hospital just couldn &apos;t just have a kind of generator .
it has to be something better . &quot;
but this is how this can be assumed whether there &apos;s no current or not , because they can use the <unk> on the basis , and more than they &apos;re missing .
but we want to be sure that this is the effective and social device that we can ask .
the different species of the state in africa , the first group of <unk> , the first <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> in the cavitation .
anyway , as a <unk> named john <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , which was surprisingly in the <unk> bc to be <unk> centuries .
almost a fifth of all the greenhouse gases from the <unk> -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the <unk> and animals are on the assembly line , not just like the tools that are not just like that .
<unk> was a purely <unk> french french .
a picture of <unk> , or a painting , isn &apos;t it ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
so i &apos;m going to ask you one question .
some of us would mean that maybe that they would not be so miserable .
i asked about a year ago , i was a question : &quot; why am i know , i i i know what i know ? &quot;
at the weekend , you have the choice .
you can make a picture of a iphone , and all the names , although it sometimes .
she &apos;s got distracted . he &apos;s got this running .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think it &apos;s just about interest , more about interest , if the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or aesthetic experience -- a vibrant experience -- a big piece of work .
human nature needs changing .
but one part of the reason -- and this is why we have a ethical : why we have a ethical : that they &apos;re also engaged .
it could be human being made , but perhaps not very .
jh : it &apos;s not possible to play with this power ?
and so i knew i knew i was a little bit of the way .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
this is a great <unk> in the front door .
we take the pizza , our deepest communities , and then the way that the slices of the cars are in the hallway and us .
i was sure 20 , i was going to launch in a toilet .
i thought , okay , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you want to put the work .
it &apos;s not a photoshop .
they were able to create alternative to create alternatives , and they took money money , so they &apos;re going to make some interesting lessons .
this project called a <unk> .
and so we went to the <unk> and we did this , it was -- the attention we got .
and they just describes the <unk> -- everything they &apos;re saying is called the <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , and it &apos;s a performer .
it &apos;s going to be done with origami . so .
people are focused on the art of art in the art of art .
or they &apos;re clinging to the top , and they &apos;re averaging about 50 stars on a flag on a flag .
how would you do a single flap ?
we have these rules with the with you , circles , you covered the <unk> , the extra rules of the brain , the extra rules .
you can do lots of things .
but if you want to make bigger , you could have something origami .
and openings doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re walking in your space or whether you &apos;re in a body .
i grew up in a <unk> in the state of washington with a lot of the time , on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on a lot of time on
we have three minutes , but we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i want to talk about this , because unless we can &apos;t acknowledge this limitless , that &apos;s really painful .
and in a moment i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you see in graph -- it &apos;s beginning to see -- it &apos;s beginning to see -- it &apos;s beginning to the women , the <unk> , and it goes on the day .
you gave them up .
because i write about all the book , i i still had to be able to do this , and i don &apos;t have any answer .
and this was very disheartening .
because we don &apos;t have any information nor not yet fully anger , in the form of smallpox , in this weird , in this weird , where they can see that .
there &apos;s no man or no woman , the middle east is in the middle of the middle , and it &apos;s the cable .
the personal income was written on a scale , to keep the liberalization of the cure that time than doubled , in that time , almost tripled .
and to listen to me and understand what i say , you need to understand about 60 bits per second .
so , the last book of me , so i &apos;ve got some of the ceo of the surroundings of &quot; -- the of her surroundings as a very successful , and yet very <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s always a pleasure thing , because you feel it in your life , but not really to change .
&quot; where are you born , and to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had assumed their own sense , they had their own sense of community , and even for hostility , which she was obsessed with birth , they didn &apos;t really want to be able to reduce the way beyond it . they didn &apos;t really want to be able to do that .
more people are or more people are in the future or the present , in the past .
i went down into the room i should sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where it &apos;s home ?
there was a big gap between a billion billion in the industrialized charges , and the two billion in the developing world .
but this is the world that we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why i &apos;m going to show you , digital technology .
the survival of the kids is the new green green .
and again , they better than we said , &quot; your <unk> and your your life is shocking . &quot;
but if you give people accountable , they don &apos;t change the sophistication of heart disease .
and i started working on working with <unk> , they grow , and then i worked with stopwatches , with <unk> , -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce that gene couldn &apos;t .
one of the media was my mother-in-law , and i don &apos;t know how old she is .
could you be good at the summer of the equator .
sure many advances , many of the <unk> life .
this is actually true photography , in the sense that shows that the limb has been living less .
and here on the right , you see , what six months later , the virgin mary <unk> .
a <unk> is from two different types .
we then put it back into this oven-like device that we identified this machine device
more more complex is organs , and the most effective solid are the high solid <unk> , with each amount of <unk> , with each amount of heart , liver and kidney .
this is still in the <unk> .
we prefer to be cells that are not reject and tumors .
we need only five seconds .
for every problem there , they have an idea .
i &apos;ve been humbled something in a panic -- unlike all the <unk> , sugar i had had -- but this is really creepy .
this doesn &apos;t mean you a <unk> .
i went from door and sells <unk> .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would make this stuff .
this is , &quot; you need to find a way to find faster faster .
i sold copious .
they get no regular income , but they have the opportunity to find more tasks , and they learn to learn to learn the ability to the ability to find additional choices .
if you go into a restaurant , and bad use , you &apos;ll show you how bad .
these boys , it &apos;s locust .
the evolution of today students is to throw all the interests .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of cultural <unk> , <unk> cellulose .
the values of the past , also , that gives a lot of these kinds of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of the principles that is not the <unk> .
they have a spirit of mind . and they have other people .
what we should do feel when we think about conservatives , except this case of the poet , -- what &apos;s going to do : what &apos;s going to do : what &apos;s going to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and this doesn &apos;t just have to another result , it has the potential to change how we relate to each other .
completely different .
it &apos;s not a proper organization , but clear -- let me explain the end of the -- just let me explain the liberties with the liberties , they want to leave them .
john pepper .
and i &apos;m going to show me how often that happened .
he told me that he &apos;s the <unk> <unk> and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake &apos;s room in the next room , and we &apos;re going to <unk> . &quot;
so , for me , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to go through this process and show them like this journey .
and the hospital hospital and general was happy .
i just want to conclude that we understand really understand .
i &apos;m going to talk about people who asked : &quot; it really can really possible to use this rendering of the microbial ecosystems ? &quot;
another possibility of how microbes can go through people , architects often , to seek spaces , to seek spaces , similar spaces to people to prevent the <unk> interaction , or the exchange of ideas in the world , and offices of ideas in the world and offices .
imagine a design of a design , the microbes , or a telephone phone or a telephone phone .
and no one knew about this .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> <unk> for the macintosh macintosh .
and it was his <unk> from the <unk> .
and it was a method that was <unk> , and one method that you wanted to be able to do was a <unk> <unk> .
on 78 percent of the voices , to give you a idea of the <unk> , , , , in the <unk> genome only three percent .
and the last message i want to show you , is , you &apos;re going to do is , you can be a pretty successful .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what is a worthy privilege to stand today .
this is the school that built with community .
something we have in gando , are <unk> .
just like this .
good morning . magic is an essential way to be the key to be able to make the power that &apos;s really going to be really becoming incoherent .
there &apos;s the color red red and the color , they &apos;re going to get the tops of the tops of day .
voice : why not ? this is a very good piece of paper .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not so much a living .
but you can &apos;t have a <unk> like china , on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason for this is , first of the state of china , a very specific point of a very special <unk> , the state of the the pad , the embodiment of chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was jewish 400,000 kilometers , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and shanghai .
we have seen this in terms of the <unk> -- the position of the <unk> lack of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> -- or the <unk> .
he goes into a street in a street , and the cars drive down .
red <unk> is called green <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
and the first song was in english , the second was on chinese .
they were asked her .
i was <unk> , i wrote a name of the city , looked at the city as canvas .
i mean , these were the most of my friends in my friends .
they &apos;ve all been given to basically , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
&quot; you , you mean , you &apos;re a <unk> face -- that &apos;s how to do exactly the right ? &quot;
i want to get people that i went to go to the media , i had about them in the media .
i took a more photos on and we launched the project .
are you ? you &apos;re going to be about the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were established , <unk> , <unk> , a woman , &quot; now can see god . &quot;
because this is a big part of this . there &apos;s layers of every behind each photo .
but they &apos;ve got me a promise to me .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
when i think about the mesh and what you see , what you &apos;re going to see , why do you know , there &apos;s some factors that i want to give you .
they have a trend .
zipcar started a decade in 2000 , in 2000 .
it &apos;s not a look at the participation of participation , and cities have implications in participation .
it &apos;s very inexpensive , and it &apos;s very <unk> .
the last 40 years were remarkable times .
and boom .
this would be used to reset a <unk> .
it &apos;s vital that the ted <unk> ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas about that we think about the environment , after the beginning , that &apos;s a particularly informed of the most likely to be the most risky and <unk> .
my my head of my family are academics that are moving to the <unk> of our <unk> .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he would be , but something about it was really really .
i sat here , just like you &apos;re here in the audience .
this is another image .
since then , spoken <unk> , it &apos;s got me as much as a lot of the .
i started to investigate the <unk> <unk> of the human rights .
i said , let &apos;s make something different .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better , einstein is very honored to be the no-brainer between all the no-brainer today , in fact , at ted , is very excited .
it would be very dangerous when you &apos;re alive .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , you have the problem , you have the problem , you have the problem , you know ?
sw : big , big .
sw : what &apos;s going to do ?
my parents found this important for your inner arm .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s kind of things apart apart , it &apos;s things like i &apos;ve got to <unk> .
the body is a higher density than the water , at least 95 percent of the body of the body .
and this is what they &apos;re going to bring very far .
i wondered what that means .
so , you can beat the <unk> , you &apos;d pick up , and you &apos;re going to call out of the <unk> without that they &apos;re behaving .
and she looked at me and said , &quot; well , &quot; well , &quot; well , &quot; well , &quot; well , &quot;
i think they &apos;re being tightly to look very good .
and i &apos;ve been talking about all of the 50,000 students , and , so , , , a dozen of schools , my pelvis , my readers , the way , by the way .
we found -- and we were busy with quite a very awkward things and then we &apos;re doing -- but we found that the young people .
<unk> <unk> : a small introduction in the <unk>
and then , the only person who &apos;s a young shepherd , and he shepherd , a young shepherd , and says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry , men , on horses and <unk> .
goliath is clever . he has no chance .
so , goliath is richer than recreational time and normally , there &apos;s an explanation at the time , and normally , there &apos;s an explanation for everybody else .
and i think that in a very important lesson for us all .
and it turns out that we are from a <unk> , and this microbes will even bring us from a <unk> , and that microbes are good , instead of us .
they all have microbes and the ileum that they &apos;re inserted in the recipient .
the pills pills , or the <unk> you can eat , or maybe two , or maybe five thousand , and the human community has saved thousands of thousands of thousand species .
we need a <unk> for the microbes that are in and on people , we can understand what they &apos;re doing our lives .
very many people think about the internet is very violent , but for us , for us , for us , it &apos;s about global global .
when you first came to a slightly more to me , thought , they would probably know , they would probably remember that everything was just in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk about truth and objectivity .
and we &apos;ve been talking about 130 <unk> , 40 .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s not enough to start .
and i always say , you also like to dig that , actually , actually all the rules of wikipedia , actually all the rules of wikipedia , actually , all the rules of wikipedia , actually , all the rules of wikipedia , actually , all the rules of wikipedia , that actually can make ...
it seems like most of the textbook , the arts , who are using nature from the numbers of the world .
in the jungle of guatemala , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> ,
a a not <unk> indians in <unk> , in <unk> , there &apos;s a mate in the year , and here &apos;s what it &apos;s .
it &apos;s also a way under your cognitive <unk> .
we found activity in other <unk> -- in <unk> , with computation , and we have a loss of profit .
i &apos;ve got a girlfriend that was just a terrible <unk> .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we turn to each other , and we freeze our <unk> , &quot; and we &apos;re talking about .
so , tools like the poets , knife or proton beams that i had in a towel .
i had been wide long and wide , but never been around nearby .
in some of the <unk> , they shredded a <unk> , about the <unk> .
so dolphins can do and look at the distance .
look , you look at your mate and the other <unk> .
we found out , we found that free dolphins isn &apos;t just like this , on a keyboard on a keyboard .
this dolphin called the dolphin called the &quot; <unk> , &quot; because they &apos;re about 12 <unk> .
but as we sound to natural sound , we can decode this back to the end .
and the word is .
there &apos;s yves rossy .
and especially if you &apos;re in the <unk> , you have to fly the feeling .
yr : i just just trying to be .
i &apos;ve been able to do in the past 15 years -- never again , with this kind of wings , but the beginning .
we just say it &apos;s not .
but it was mounted on top and full of <unk> .
and they have trouble , in fact , what they saw , they wonder , with the whole powers .
because this event was the scientific revolution , the of our intellect , for the physical revolution , and how we can adapt to our power , <unk> is <unk> .
and finally , why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a kind of guesses , our bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a <unk> story .
and only if an explanation is good , it &apos;s important that you can do .
there &apos;s not very expensive . they are pretty much .
it &apos;s just about 30,000 .
what &apos;s the minto for a place ?
the new festival of the audience is actually a critical role in the performance of performance .
she had to other other , after the sultan &apos;s elephant , and this has all done all the time . &quot;
&quot; no <unk> , that &apos;s fine . &quot; first doctor : &quot; is you so ? &quot;
i thought , well , my career was going to .
this is a surprise where i sat there on the rock .
this is a piece of <unk> ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you today , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and polar bears and polar bears and <unk> leopard seals here means more than any other than else i ever ever .
people said , &quot; we knew that they &apos;re malignant . we knew it . &quot;
and this seal took the penguin , the penguin <unk> and and then and then it spits him .
they got a path , a penguin .
they tried to <unk> my camera <unk> , which is the dream of a photographers .
paul collier : stories from a <unk> <unk>
open your eyes .
do you have a ring ?
they focus on this task .
joe , we &apos;re going to do this , until they &apos;re going to be .
so , we have , yes , we &apos;ve got a little man , a <unk> , , working up the day .
as i said , they use your reality .
we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we work , and we &apos;re going to build something new and developing .
a call in the united states , after canada or china costs five or <unk> u.s. dollars .
it &apos;s <unk> , so you can plug a snowball and so on , in fact , in some places , and it would have some quantity .
and the time , the buildings were higher higher and greater , so that the mechanical were hugely incredible , the tremendous enormous increases .
imagine two americans are americans in italy .
please raise your own .
the best definition of the &apos; s <unk> i know -- she &apos;s so much -- from zero-sum gary .
he &apos;s very uncomfortable , very old <unk> .
but look at the other three lines .
are not just the foundation of extrinsic and <unk> and <unk> ?
she went down , and they continued to go .
and they say , &quot; gloria , your laws of my body . &quot;
and we have the sign of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> is the wrong god -- and both sides are working together .
and so the answer to my mind , my opinion is commitment to use the truth and try to use a better future for us .
but if you &apos;re responding to join other other people in the environment that are not going to be , but hurt hurt -- that &apos;s not necessarily to talk about <unk> .
we look at something else , &quot; and not to be the situations that are actually quite very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
you see somebody a sad trip to how often you take a flood like it was introduced , how many the police was in queensland ?
there was just a few people who were shot .
it &apos;s 72 , and it looks like this is the <unk> , with your own .
and if you &apos;re going to use them to use them , they &apos;re not going to be <unk> . &quot;
we &apos;ve just begun to organize makers in our lives .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but ...
but he moved to see here to other people who were doing exactly the same as he was doing .
this is called &quot; oblivion . &quot;
and we need to bring this into the schools , or in the communities , lots of lots of ways -- the ability to create us and new new .
there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and indeed , we &apos;re looking at these <unk> pictures of all the time -- you call them <unk> .
they don &apos;t want to be about a way , but you have to introduce your world .
custer , the <unk> of a <unk> , glamorous .
but it &apos;s going to be the illusion that if you buy a lamp that you buy a borderless life .
the perfect <unk> <unk> -- the perfect chain , with perfect <unk> .
because glamour can be greatly <unk> and <unk> .
but i also know how they were working on .
i did the number of places .
i heard about women who were in her favorite , or 48 , in their <unk> , like <unk> <unk> on the parking streets , with the acid .
then i got to starve cancer -- or i found cancer .
my friend foster the great <unk> that &apos;s a big number of this big seal and i asked her , &quot; what &apos;s that ? &quot;
it was for me to <unk> <unk> and a grasp .
because we all are so passionate about <unk> , and we know the insides of our fellow and their payments intentions . &quot;
children need a long time , until you get the system .
rs : <unk> , now , the joshua &apos;s joshua , to get something .
rs : should ivan ivan , so ivan is now trouble ?

i &apos;m going to prove to prove to prove that it &apos;s a <unk> ship .
please tell me they don &apos;t even know if we say that we say , &quot; pentagon , the pentagon .
but why do you need to do something about something ?
and it was , they &apos;d be an course of <unk> .
and secondly , it &apos;s possible to be able to get down ?
they want to go back to a device .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under six of the six <unk> of the world and work under the average american charge of the caribbean .
but the new idea is that the revolutionary idea is the <unk> idea is that it &apos;s like &quot; good . &quot;

and the last day , the woman who was going to be able to do everything , and we talked about each other , and we talked about them , &quot; would you ? &quot;

how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in the bureaucratic <unk> , the teachers are alone in classes and have to keep on many of them .
some people say that the transformation of the <unk> is the leading resembles of a <unk> .

and i was the whole morning for 15 miles to the <unk> .
so this was obviously an <unk> device .
we could do that with phones .
so you have a business plan .
&quot; the government must provide <unk> <unk> . &quot;
it was like , long ago , long ago , long ago , when i was a lot of time , and i was studying john college in bangalore .

and so , you &apos;re the fact that we &apos;re in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , again , this is a kind of <unk> model of what &apos;s happening in the midst of the klan .
they &apos;re moving apart , because the space is bigger .
by looking at things like science -- how much of them are when we are in experience , which is we can bring in experience , which is decreasing , in the field of dark matter and dark energy in the face of the power system .
the big questions in physics .

and indeed , there was this change in the united states during the united states .
it &apos;s a disease that a lot of adults in africa , and also many children are children .
in uganda , we see that the prevalence expands .

he was convicted <unk> , &quot; the &quot; <unk> , &quot; the &quot; <unk> , &quot; the <unk> , &quot; the <unk> , &quot; , &quot; because he built a <unk> on the tunnel , and then the tunnel , there &apos;s always a kind of <unk> .
this is just a huge impact on the water .
then we ask ourselves why the membrane is able to adapt and why is so much power .
for instance , in the <unk> of <unk> , in a material .
at <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> , we &apos;re working with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine : biomimicry : biomimicry ...
&quot; yeah , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not a , and thankfully , not boys .
you can &apos;t do anything .
it &apos;s been going to happen again because this was now used to be .
they said , &quot; yeah . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s praying . &quot;
this was a <unk> for 1,000 inmates in this prison .
secondly , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
now , let me tell you about a project that we were a few years later , we made a kind of development of captcha .
it &apos;s basically a old book called the old book .
the number of sides is actually so high that the number of the words that we are going to charge a day , very big .
some are more fun .
at the time , the web is a wide .
then my main character question .
there &apos;s a way to be able to beat two flies to have a <unk> .
but what might be surprising is that we get the translations of the fin , even if they &apos;re near , even if they &apos;re near , we &apos;re also precisely precisely precisely precisely , and that &apos;s very surprising .
there &apos;s people once learn about money , you don &apos;t have to pay money , pay them with your time .
the <unk> side , the company , what you really really do .

maybe this human beings have right now , and his thoughts , maybe not good .
ten percent time , the thoughts of the time -- when sex .
i played the violent africans , the african terrorists .
well , from the first <unk> , not a reduction of litigation -- so no one was the absolute majority of the absolute round three weeks later , the elections in a second round three weeks later .
here &apos;s now a more interesting .
so i &apos;m also able to recruit and learned .
people in the 17th century , not really much less comfortable as much as much as we were able to dominate this stuff , and that we can take this out of a specific reason .
and so , i said charles and money , i will have to give money to be a building , and you can make them there , but not talking about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought , everybody with a little bit understood that .
just to see what if you take the two together .
so i &apos;ve got something that &apos;s not personally .
if you &apos;re rich today , you &apos;re going to talk about .
you &apos;ll tell you , if you &apos;re the temperature of the atmosphere , they don &apos;t always look at -- they don &apos;t even have a carefully of satellite , very carefully from satellites and not .
biochemist achilles cohen : the experiment . he told the foundation of modern economies from the 17th century and from his own <unk> in the garden of the <unk> and <unk> curiosity curiosity , and we really make a lot of science in all their shapes .
i wanted to represent a simple kind of easy body , which these <unk> , <unk> spaces .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a $ ebay for new york city and &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; and <unk> , the <unk> that made out of the <unk> in a urban environments .
i love to travel , and berlin is an <unk> of my <unk> .
and all of the time i &apos;ve been talking about a single rat to some of some of these locations , until recently , when i was in the london .
the first question is , and maybe you &apos;re writing them on a sheet of paper , physically , or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , they can also try and try and figure out .
and we &apos;re going to be the best <unk> in africa &apos;s world , &quot; because of our <unk> <unk> .
except , except , except -- now , at your <unk> , you &apos;ve got thinking , &quot; what happens when happen during the night sky ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems , if people have already seen a idea of how everything works , is quite hard to change that .
and as a a touchy for extraterrestrial chemistry , and the colleagues that vary between the organic , the world and the <unk> world .
and you can see , he &apos;s , <unk> , , grows in a sense .
we &apos;ve even astonishing we can manipulate .
and darwin himself has been in a <unk> that seems to help its lives in a warm small , maybe not in a warm time , not in scotland , in scotland , maybe , maybe , in africa , maybe it &apos;s different .
what &apos;s life ? what &apos;s this stuff of life ?
and we can connect and and and and and thousands thousands of a really big <unk> model , in the same size , but it &apos;s not a carbon in the way .
we want to put them in the environment , and we want them to get your energy from the sun .
and i think , if we can create a historical biology , and matter , is <unk> , then the <unk> , then the rest of life .
but there &apos;s a second reason why i think this <unk> , : how to measure these <unk> : every single one will make a single one .
and these are high women , the <unk> , who has a woman with a woman with a woman and they were asking .
i sat on friday , my computer , and i couldn &apos;t see how the mortality in the morning of <unk> <unk> .
like you know , love these economists spend these economists , they want more and more .
as you can see , this is not a average of average camp is not a average , and this really quick progress .
but you talk about it .
in which there were a high , or very , very , very , very , very , very big , six to eight .
here &apos;s also happening .
whatever is more worth 13 dollars .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 12 .
and he said , &quot; the <unk> is the <unk> .
all of the time was a border .
and <unk> , after my opinion , after my opinion , the world will make a difference , not just for some few of the few few , but for everybody .
... above the state of the knee , yes , that would be difficult to ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth are there enough to get negative needs to the negative needs , but not all the rest of the freedom .
<unk> , .
i went to high school .
when i was at the end of the 19th century , 40 -- if two <unk> are not interconnected with each other , and they built on the front door , i built teams .
they &apos;re just in the middle and now i &apos;ve got apps in the front of the painting .
it &apos;s about making something old old and old in the 21st century .
it &apos;s still hot , but not more <unk> .
but there &apos;s not under a <unk> pressure , and it isn &apos;t so extreme as it is that the <unk> is not to leave the <unk> , the reactor .
i &apos;m confident that the reactor i &apos;m here , can be agnostic , a cutting-edge speed projects , a cutting-edge <unk> , the great scientific projects , and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we &apos;re going to move a <unk> where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> of the case that they &apos;re in the forest .
he &apos;s at the end of a long symphony , good scientist who said he &apos;s his son , he says , &quot; before , &quot; especially <unk> against you .
you normally get a lot of , but here &apos;s a place where you can walk on a lot of walk , you can walk out in this city .
then they &apos;re wrong as a surgical instrument , as a <unk> , by giving them not .
when i was , i was very introverted and intention to me alone .
then it &apos;s just about to start on a point where they then went to the end .
so i &apos;ve got it out of concrete , because it &apos;s not .
this was this tool .
and for me , the most important thing is because since i was a kid , i wanted to love my passion and love .
it &apos;s 25 days : the <unk> has grown up 32 days : poor and hands and hands : the media starts to the <unk> , where the current is developed by the fastest .
the complexity , this is a single system in a single system , is beyond each of math math math .
because apparently , apparently , there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> <unk> , not in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
june sent me a colleague of berkeley , <unk> <unk> , a very interesting , and said , &quot; can you see a very interesting and asked , &quot; can you see this ? &quot;
there &apos;s two ways of rice and <unk> stars -- on the matter of matter -- and <unk> elements in the universe and <unk> .
because can you imagine that anything ?
now imagine a object , a life object , or something that we can &apos;t explain to explain and say , &quot; we &apos;re just like , we give them up and say , &quot; we &apos;re going to work . physics . &quot;
and if we see , <unk> , , and oxygen , i think , i think we have the perfect e.t. .
i was just wondering , &quot; really ? &quot; and he &apos;s like , &quot; absolutely &quot; . &quot;
what i can tell you is : it &apos;s universal ; we &apos;ve all got them .
i &apos;m slightly addicted to <unk> , but this is another talk .
this led to a small meltdown -- the really kind of really rather way .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is not a <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what are you going to be a sense of what &apos;s going to be ? &quot;
i just did right , you didn &apos;t right .
we do as as if we were doing what we do not do in other people .
people <unk> their meals in twitter , the <unk> of her children &apos;s children .
so , if we think about , they also make sense of the systematic , we think about how they can be able to be able to be able to be able to inject our <unk> , for our <unk> and self-awareness .
and today , i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do , we wanted to find a new counsel to health care .
steven , steven divides his history . but it &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people praying .
i also love this <unk> , including this was the only <unk> that online online and available .
and here &apos;s a paper .
you cannot have no <unk> , you cannot not use the data , not to be able to scientific methods .
this is the curve above the <unk> .
but my brother wasn &apos;t going to be at the end .
if we went from here to the huaorani , we would find a little bit of the scaffolding , 120 miles up , 120 miles up , three miles wide wide wide wide wide and the two of the glaciers .
to change the state , you just need two volts in a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from the brain .
there &apos;s some networks of funders complex devices .
and it also has also implications on the risk of risk .
so we could put each other <unk> to a <unk> .
we see the formation and <unk> <unk> , which is to <unk> , which is our <unk> and our experiences in our own world from the complexity of the complexity .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> capacity capacity , <unk> <unk> -- unless you &apos;re used to pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these <unk> .
without <unk> .
so we were on our <unk> .
and this is not even more than that , which is invented .
and my brain starts very quickly , that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> <unk> in the world .
because this question continues to be able to predict our external world , but that i can only 10 percent of the gradient person can predict a person &apos;s predictions that if i have to <unk> .
and this is from two reasons , scientifically <unk> and the right around .
we &apos;re going to open your <unk> , you &apos;re open , a positive person of the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> of the copyright protection in their social environment .
weightfully to say -- a <unk> , you know -- my father was the most uplifting man in the world .
and so i &apos;m going to mit . i went to mit .
they said that it &apos;s called .
they take a huge disk from cardboard .
he was the first digital media in tokyo .
listen ? how cows ? this is a morning in logan .
there are all these things , but most love i &apos;m going to learn to be able to learn the world .
and i put this with passion .
their culture comes into schools , and i want to show you how to overcome this problem .
they &apos;re really nervous because they don &apos;t want to school school , no boys .
and over the little moments in my life .
or , mothers who are the young ?
we need to change the posture of young boys in the elementary school .
and you have the idea that they believe that they would be okay .
so let &apos;s look at where we &apos;re going to be able to do this hypothesis .
is this problem ? yeah , a big problem .
we think that we can do this &quot; <unk> evidence of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and try to be a <unk> , whether it works .
and this was really an important lesson for me to really can really helpful .
we have a newspaper , a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s also <unk> to take my ipad , and this is a software that &apos;s on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> , so i would put them to make a <unk> , so that people can correct different in the glass of glass , when you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m going to put from my remarkable school , i &apos;m going to put in a man &apos;s man &apos;s normal <unk> , and then in a old man man .
<unk> <unk>
radio : what do you do ?
just fold the wings together and they &apos;re going to go .
so , i &apos;ll give you another question .
and he would <unk> a <unk> <unk> , who had the audacity , and night , and overnight , and overnight , but with the secret , but with the secret of the , it wasn &apos;t good good .
because they found that the <unk> human behavior is going to be stronger .
yet we need to create a fully <unk> <unk> , we need to create a <unk> <unk> , in which you can create a lot of the value .
so , if we have all these tools available to we have to put the question -- and rituals and <unk> , this -- how we put this commitment .
they &apos;re going to lead the new <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> little , <unk> <unk> .
i felt passion , soul , soul and heart , had my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , no .
all around us , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a other replicator in this communal era .
they &apos;ve bought them .
so , you see the world &apos;s world full of brains and more memes for everybody .
we are the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hey .
they use us to produce the resource of the planet , and more more computers , to produce more computers , which is what we hear here at ted .
and we we &apos;ll have to do this , and how we we have to have the second and the first time ?
in conjunction with <unk> -- with the ministry of public health services , with different <unk> , with different <unk> , with different <unk> , we may be more than a more building .
it &apos;s not going to be more likely to do it . &quot;
and because i had been living years from my body , took this entire one hour .
we &apos;ve found out that it was good for that , i would have been my reflection to recover from the pain .
and how bad would would be the sentence , if i would caught ?
it wasn &apos;t like that the police person -- less awkward -- less awkward -- less awkward -- less awkward -- less awkward -- those who couldn &apos;t remember almost no bills .
so if you think you think , if you think you think money money is because you get directly , make a difference ?
so it &apos;s like this .
i think all of these forces very bad impacts on the .
but i can tell me . i &apos;m working on the .
that &apos;s the most <unk> i can show you today .
and suddenly , amazon are going to be <unk> and the power of the <unk> , , as they want to spend money , what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and what money is , and
maybe this is a big leap ?
i don &apos;t need to explain to explain this -- last week -- i had to explain my research , and are structures that has been a single to another .
and i knew how animals are like the <unk> , or even most of the animal efforts , they &apos;re not using the tissue , by they &apos;re going to stabilize about bones .
and that was that every single infants that we found out that every hydrostatic skeleton we found to <unk> the same <unk> of the same <unk> .
all i &apos;ve been doing , what i &apos;ve been really surprised .
a funny song about the global warming , from jill .
well , then i have to be now .
all right , ok .
let &apos;s do we play a play ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> , the benefits of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> is <unk> , and the ben became a <unk> .
so , what happens next , what &apos;s the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
i was forced to break my home , the democratic republic of the congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> has the <unk> of the united nations , the wealth of the country &apos;s worth of the country to the speed of the country .
but we &apos;re not alive .
they have to stand very inexpensive .
but couldn &apos;t be for those flow of the <unk> ?
they demanded of governments , and they &apos;re going to have the governments , and they also have to get them .
but suppose we also think our goal would be , new economic action to the foundation of the pyramid .
because they have a whole bunch of this little transactions to make their own .
he liked it to the lap , because he said that it was painful painful for him to be a way in his own bed .
even since the way , as a <unk> <unk> and the british society for civic general idea that the sun .
so , what &apos;s a fusion ? here &apos;s something .
and this is the energy that is the fusion .
about this as a traditional <unk> .
we have to make it too .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country and it &apos;s also a with a big impact .

but who knows how to make a computer ?
but i &apos;m also because of the ties that people are , and the unprecedented possibility of the ideas , the people who are chatting to the ideas , and they &apos;re really comfortable . i &apos;m sure that technology is going to continue to improve the short-term system .
this is like a <unk> building . i have this passion here .
we talk about it , we don &apos;t necessarily don &apos;t take seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they are gone .
if we think about the <unk> <unk> , , it &apos;s usually the rapid development of the problem that we can find things that are constantly changing ?

this is the expression , even as a proud known as a student , was a proud of a <unk> , and she showed people blind people , and of birth to blind people , they do at a <unk> .

and you have to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so , it &apos;s like me , richard and me , that this ideas isn &apos;t abused .
and of course , they are extinct .
but among all these ideas , the weakest of our technology , they spread , are many of ideas ideas .
and as we should not trying to do this , it too .
and in play , it &apos;s called the end .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went to the tour .
i know you &apos;ll say , you &apos;ll say , &quot; t , there &apos;s no music in the music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
no one hears one . no one knows the other .
they &apos;re going to see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to make sure that this should not happen to happen , but we need to be better if it &apos;s better , but we need to pull it to you , you need to pull about the consequences and the reactions .
they &apos;re working on in <unk> . they &apos;re drivers .
five dollars a life can save lives .
they &apos;re flying about two dollars on day , and explained explained to me that they &apos;re not marry nor kids have not heard before kids , are these things .

and so they came and more <unk> , and recently , they &apos;ve now got a income to support their family .
just to you to someone , with another culture , from another <unk> , with another <unk> , with another <unk> , who is kind of different , and they &apos;re going to stir it into a conversation .
i start with where the story was the story of the contents .
today tomorrow , before they had to be <unk> who had to hurt who had to be pointing to ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these less famous houses in which 50,000 people live in the , 35 percent of the homes in homes had a <unk> shower .

we &apos;ve done this . he was anxious .
we found that in this region , we found that in this region , the <unk> is the most fundamental of disease and death .
one thing is in the context of all , i think , &quot; how do and apartheid is not a far from here : &quot; how do we have to plan to not <unk> . it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t care about if you &apos;re not a <unk> . really .
it sounds really <unk> , which is from here , but when you try to anticipate , it &apos;s amazing effective .
and with that statement , i &apos;ve got to you to think that kids don &apos;t live their community to live in a better life .
this is the youngest <unk> in america in america , in america , with our <unk> of the bronx .
this is a photograph of the bronx that the children in his house , not in his house , not in prison , so they felt .

now , you might think about this .
keep kids from these stores .
stephen : a teacher who &apos;s south south bronx
secondly , i bet that even you see see this as a crab &apos;s already right here is a look closer to this line .
and to 10 : <unk> <unk> .
people who smile and migraine , who introduced a corresponding camera with <unk> brain -- here in red , in red , which is three millimeters per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have been migraine , and we need a <unk> , i think we &apos;re now .

i &apos;ve got the first time to get it here .
this is the people underneath the barrier , i think , because they &apos;re really going to be able to share the process of the process , you &apos;re going to share your knowledge to share their world .
they &apos;ve been smuggled , recruit connexions to use their <unk> and <unk> , who are in the world in the world around the world &apos;s teachers around the world of teachers teach themselves .
yeah , books , books , from which maybe maybe 100 or 1,000 dollars in 2020 .
it surprises not that it &apos;s all like , or a predator ?
how does we do it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the most popular <unk> are , when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to focus down or <unk> of our country to see how that works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a loaner .

now there &apos;s a <unk> , immediate <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> current , and many of our devices , even in the .
it &apos;s a endless debate and there are no no no no way , no one answer to it , but if you &apos;re a when you &apos;re , &quot; well , what do we say about the data ? &quot;
instead , he has a very carefully review , which is always happening , when technology &apos;s first time in a environment and a community .
so , there &apos;s this , of course , two different ways .
this is a great illustration -- it &apos;s actually a yves <unk> .
i mean , this was a bit of the time , how did it make me happy .
well , there was a question i had a question that i &apos;m like , well , i can go to a more of the things that i &apos;d like to do more things that i &apos;m like to do this , and less about that i &apos;m not going to do ?
and here &apos;s the beginning of the west .

what &apos;s happening is that the most visualization is that this kind of visualization is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure to you , because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is after the eden of eden in britain .
why not how ? not how ? so why can there are two theories .
and a reasonable learns is to work .
now , after some months of the , i &apos;ve discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you say , which is called <unk> , and the same thing that &apos;s going to be the same .
this is the foundation of the device that these two guys have built .
they &apos;ve got made it , and it &apos;s exactly like coumarin .
this was a good thing .
at the time , a series of things in the future i want to do with you .

and this is how we look for them .
and then you &apos;re going to find that one of us there and little bits .
he had a <unk> and the <unk> of others , female <unk> of others , female smaller <unk> , to be a lot of bright groups of 12 years .
is this good evolutionary evolutionary adaptation or a basis of the time that we are going to be the standard species , the earth on the planet earth ?
but will we take that , or we will take nature ?
one day , a few weeks ago , maybe one of a shop in my <unk> , i was going to put my <unk> in my shop for <unk> . i had a <unk> assignment .
this is an fundamental transformation for me .
my urging : round of 70 layers of this <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
you want to know how obsessed ? this project is just for me , and i &apos;ve been so far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as the bird can be sensible sensible .
when we went to the way , the spectacular blue in sydney , it was a perfect <unk> <unk> , it was a perfect <unk> , the smell of a <unk> , the smell of a <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever walk again , then only with a <unk> . &quot;
i remember my father &apos;s thinking about the wheelchair outside and i was down by the top and the first time the sun on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll put you next to the next , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
they would tell me the <unk> and i called the i called the i called <unk> and i said that i was like to put a <unk> <unk> .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and mom ? never .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m going to be instinctively .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> of a richard <unk> .
how to get a phone in three weeks , when i have these things that are over millions of years ?
each of these elements could do it as a kind of <unk> .
and in his days , he was the highest in the highest of the british .
i look at a single password of view , and as close to furniture , it &apos;s based on furniture , it &apos;s based on furniture , it &apos;s based on aluminum , but that &apos;s not the <unk> , as opposed to aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future , it &apos;s a loaner .
if you don &apos;t tell it up alongside architecture , it feels like me .
this is my studio . it &apos;s the way .
it was made from a lot .
i had been made my ph.d. , i had fortunate to be a <unk> to be a <unk> to be used to explore the ocean .
there was one of these tenement engineering .
he closes red bioluminescence like a <unk> <unk> to animals that are based on animals who are blind and you can see without it .
so they use it to eat and mate .
i urge you to mention a person science , which is that i used to use .
this is a magical place .
so i was on the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the .
and june june , i got a <unk> maneuver in 1995 , and my life was changed my life and the one duck .
and here are the the cars .
and after the price , my life changed .
another example of the performance of the performance of the <unk> in the lives of the world .
so , if i take a little -- this is the sound for purple . purple .
depending on how i hear it , i can hear the food music and the <unk> .
one of them is &quot; i &apos;ve got a martin <unk> &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is .
now , you can see that former <unk> are now the <unk> <unk> .
you want to say anything to say , &quot; that &apos;s against a terror . &quot;
perfectly frank .
and what happens if teachers dispersed up ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t mean ? they don &apos;t have the rule . why don &apos;t you get the rule ?
it &apos;s so , it &apos;s so freedom to a <unk> structure structure .
because life is complex , and here &apos;s the hardest change : we need to move the hardest authority for the electricity and use of steam and use the <unk> .
one free society takes the red , otherwise , otherwise you will find will soon be much more .
for the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> investment can make <unk> , for the ones that they can .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really difficult to facebook columns with a slight <unk> .
he had a very bad job .
he had just a <unk> in the last day .
but the problem , on rules and incentives , it &apos;s a way that they &apos;re doing the action and they <unk> the <unk> activity in the way .
wise rewards are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that some of the 19th century , for the sake of time .
why has this idea ?
people would be <unk> .
it was a remarkable time . i &apos;m going to show the <unk> , the <unk> , something that we can -- america and the rest of the world .
this was <unk> , the <unk> .
we have a complete antithesis to do this .
what i want to show you is what you need to transport the most delicious of <unk> uranium to transport .
what would have been if they were able to have given weapons ?
we come down , and then the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the <unk> that they &apos;re just right here in the <unk> .
part of the problem is that the <unk> themselves is the <unk> themselves , is overwhelmed by the ideas of an attitude disaster .
it was sent to somebody who &apos;s a retired of the <unk> , and the fact that it was difficult to america .
there &apos;s lots of apples there there that the wrong things and the problems have been .
we can make our results . we can make things better .
how can we do ?
it &apos;s <unk> , a dangerous way to have a dangerous .
imagine we could , we could , because if we could modify it , we could achieve more .
governments , most of the governments that most progress are the governments that are ways found to free &quot; shared value , instead of the actor to see the actor to see the actor to see the actor to see the actor to see the actor to see the actor to see the actor to see the actor to see the actor .
maybe i can look at the brain , and i can look at my <unk> .
i want to zoom in .
come along with me in the 19th century , all right now , the right june june .
we could all be so hard when facebook wasn &apos;t much time that we would not have much time .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> on the british government , to get money for the <unk> of the <unk> machines , because they believed that these machines have tremendous impact for the company .
this year &apos;s not just less wealthy men , but they also <unk> <unk> , to look at the no-brainer of the <unk> , instead of <unk> questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you something about life .
if you look at the very little things -- this person has a whole article written , and he said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of the sudden not old enough , they have no idea how this was happening , and that &apos;s what this was happening .
there &apos;s about 10,000 programs .
this would be the frequency in the best form of 26 <unk> in a video game apes .
wherever you have life , you &apos;re going to have this distribution of learning to this distribution .
to hot hot , too hot
the officer is : &quot; are you going to be ? hey , you &apos;re sure you &apos;re sure you have lost them right ? &quot;
this is the data from a single survey of the <unk> in a single district in a zambia , a few years ago , i was <unk> .
as you see , bruce had to have bruce had a lot more hair .
you could talk about 10,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had at all the time , if i had gotten the time in my plan , and i couldn &apos;t just mention .
rather than just as you were exploring the forms of the cell , should we create an software that allowed them to do the self , and without exercise and without my favorite .
this is less than i was when i was looking for two weeks than south africa .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life , in the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need to do <unk> .
i promised promised me that i would have to fly the next few , independent of fossil <unk> , independent <unk> , independent <unk> , independent <unk> , to be secure , not about the <unk> .
i think they need a look at the <unk> talk to the ted , the universities , the universities can speak with politicians and the politicians during the ride , and it really can actually make a human adventure .
and what &apos;s the goal ?
this is why all the people who all have people who think that the idea is , we &apos;re communicating to be part of the teams .
now , you just need a laptop .
as long as it was africa , africa was africa .
the next thing i want to do is , what i want to do is what &apos;s wrong is , and what &apos;s not .
this is crazy , really when you think about it .
let &apos;s stop for a second .
the fact that we are the first generation of the disease are the disease and this extremes of the ocean , you see , you see , you see , you see the ocean ; it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s going to nerves on the nerves .
this is a test for us , specifically for the leaders of the <unk> states , the <unk> are the <unk> and the way .
people find out the slow .
and with this one campaign , as a campaign , my organization , data , data , and other groups of energy and other groups of the <unk> of america in america .
and the step for step for step , a nurse , a servant , a servant , a servant , and lives .
the idea that the internet is changing the internet , which has all its lives , a country can change its lives -- and a continent that &apos;s been working on , and to digital -- and i &apos;ve got to the head .
mammograms are not a false , but volcanoes .
your job is now to realize that this shapes is that this shapes is that shapes is that shapes is that shapes is that shapes is that shapes is that shapes is that shapes is that .
so if you &apos;re just right now , then it &apos;s this sentence , literally , literally , the <unk> .
if we solve a problem , or something new , we compare what we know about what we know what is going to us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m happy to be here .
they don &apos;t even meet all this .
pm : i don &apos;t think .
how are you going to do with you , but also , with your <unk> ?
some of my reporter are arrested .
this is clearly clearly clearly a different picture .
my heart was three times .
this is a list of side effects : if you use a lot of salt like a <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , they would probably be on the intensive .
but soon i soon showed me off the coast of <unk> and i had to go back to the <unk> , i never ever seen my home .
i sat there and spoke about the <unk> and i asked , what i was going to highlight and asked him what i could do was a transplant to get a transplant to get a transplant to get a transplant to get me .
i &apos;ve got some of a dozen machines that i &apos;ve been living in .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these <unk> are also receding in the united states .
and then , interestingly , that the same company company that we sold 80 million pounds of 64 hundred million pounds of the <unk> , &quot; and the same company sold -- and the same company sold .
we launched the <unk> as a <unk> .
what would our <unk> children tells us , when they say , if they &apos;re going to say , a little bit of a bit of a <unk> , some of the same tool , some of the same tool , and a bit bit of the same tool .
the problem is that you &apos;re in in the village , in most of our villages .
here &apos;s what &apos;s called the accumulation of the <unk> <unk> alongside the airport
i expected five cents for everybody &apos;s <unk> .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s global .
here you see , in red , the distribution of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse that is the leg of a elephant , and the most of the most part of you you have hidden .
they look out of your <unk> and <unk> from all directions around us .
redwoods has a tremendous idea that is retreating in the sky , because they &apos;re doing something that you say something called <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , just like a cathedral , just like a cathedral , and help the tree , longer .
it &apos;s totally <unk> that &apos;s happening .
but since modern all the <unk> of the <unk> , and the walls break break out .
this was a 25 years ago .
let &apos;s look for instance , the <unk> look at the <unk> .
how do these people can make computers with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to watch it , like <unk> work -- and try to watch how to work , and try to avoid the <unk> that we &apos;re going to make .
they &apos;re going to see it down there , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , then this program , then this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program , this program ,
and if you look at the visuals of the scene , you can see that this is the hallmark of the mercedes .
we need to find our way to ensure that everything , even if computers were .
but i didn &apos;t have anything .
this person surrounds with the sacred .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
how does his future ?
this is disappearing , completely <unk> that &apos;s 2011 .
it would be good if people were , and they would impress to because it would be , because it &apos;s also a very shocking to change things . but it would be more shocking to two types of animals .
that means that we see a copy even if you &apos;re just a bit of the <unk> of the <unk> , this shower and a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and the lucky few , jill and kevin ? well , they would come from their <unk> and they looked at her video , and they suddenly found that her video was spread like a <unk> .
thank you !
you &apos;re going to go into the distance .
this is what was taught to do was to do , he was five years old .
i &apos;m thankful for the fact that i had a sandwich like me , which tells me how you cultivate .
what &apos;s it , you know ? not last ?
what do you do you do what do you get tenure ?
not the -- time . not the technology . i didn &apos;t know the right manager -- you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager .
in this moment , awareness or <unk> , in the moment where you &apos;re going to focus on something , you can make yourself on something , you can do something that means , it makes sense .
before you ever have what they did , and then , &quot; that &apos;s what i was ! &quot;
so , to death , they &apos;re missing , god , there was another human need : the uncertainty .
but this is true : we need it . we can make it through intimacy , through the comfort , through the comfort , through marijuana .
and there &apos;s seven different surfaces . i can &apos;t talk to you because i &apos;m projecting by drawing . the last element is .
ringing man &apos;s man with the family with family in the northwest , in new york , the died in new york , who died in new york , the day , the one was a terrorist wanted to be clear .
instead , i &apos;m really interested in creating tools that a large number of people are their stories , people everywhere .
the color of the particles is the kind of particle of the brain -- happy , positive emotion , <unk> feelings .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the computer . &quot;
and if i go down here , it &apos;s the list of the list , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
the 10 themes of ultraviolet rays out of the and the .
it &apos;s called &quot; the universe : &quot;
we can see the space and see this <unk> by betty ford , like tying your <unk> .
you can also think about quotations if you want to read .
so people clouds are clouds than something that &apos;s related .
in life , they &apos;ve learned thousands members in almost 100 countries around the earth .
you need just a step to go out , and that &apos;s so that way that way that way that way that way , so that , so that &apos;s so that way that all the rest of the other thing .
so , look at admire beauty , admire beauty , and think they always always always to carry the head into the clouds .
the ones that have been stated the same boat , which would have done , good , good .
and you know , june years ago , it was about 10 years ago , when i got to buy the <unk> to buy my first <unk> <unk> .
this footage is generated by a virtual autopsy .
so here you can see how the knife is penetrated .
it &apos;s a little sister , mechanical , which has been very , very early <unk> .
this is now a really interesting project .
so he &apos;s doing it .
so , very talented people .
i went with the kids as often as possible to go out and to get the academic cloth with the <unk> in the interconnection .
it &apos;s not all the way , but it &apos;s an incredibly fundamental summary of everything that we know about nature .
i &apos;m not going to talk to the details , why we think , the universe is subconscious , but it &apos;s about the math , we know .
in the course of my career , but always something in me .
i was founded , she was during a <unk> .
we got lots of <unk> .
this is what this is the first day after the first time in 2004 .
he &apos;s just a little bit about the <unk> and the <unk> with someone else , all know .
each one will have a <unk> <unk> , but you &apos;re going to be able to be a different disciplines .
i &apos;ve got my first computer when a teenager in accra , and it was really a really great device .
he studied the brain , and he was kind of <unk> , this was the most beautiful brain that he ever ever had .
i &apos;m going to show you the next few slides i will soon be briefly .
transistors are getting smaller to enable this , and that &apos;s what our technology is better better .
our <unk> is spinning behind this lens .
i had so fortunate to be a gut that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so now , we know what an schwarzschild radius .
i &apos;ll call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re sort of <unk> .
we can see this in our galaxy , as a place otherwise .
and this gives us a factor of 20th .
there was a bunch of alternative alternative to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it &apos;s exploding a much stronger than the other and the cloud is apart apart .
and i hope i convinced that i &apos;m tuned at least a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , and we have the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york , and saw some of some kids between the <unk> , cars and torture .
so , like the people in the 11th , the eleventh , the way that they &apos;re doing .
in the first 8 centuries of centuries , centuries , the great &quot; way to bring god .
and over new and better instruments , the age of the <unk> .
but a question : what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> : music and feelings at the time time
we &apos;re facing the dawn of a new set of <unk> .
and to the last year , they brought it on 100,000 .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where i start .
wow , a woman ! awesome !
but recently , my whole idea was in my whole new new new new <unk> to look at the new new <unk> to look at where that can really do something really cool .
well , i think this is the most potent evolutionary development of a transistor that we call &quot; the &quot;
but the element of the desire is really the most important .
we get treated with them .
let me start at this point of sam <unk> .
but even if you &apos;re the screen , even if you &apos;re much more than words than words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share your knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
first , i must be as a speaker , and i wanted to talk about what i &apos;ll give you to say , instead of what i can &apos;t offer .
and they are fun to do , their own , ultimate or a mechanical tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them .
they hold them alive and give you the sugar , and give them the sugars , so we &apos;re called .
this kind of testing tests , ok ?
somebody said , &quot; why ? &quot;
the thought he could turn the waves . couldn &apos;t . couldn &apos;t . couldn &apos;t . couldn &apos;t . couldn &apos;t . couldn &apos;t . couldn &apos;t . couldn &apos;t . couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes , and in the areas of the areas , the <unk> transparency , the <unk> and <unk> that people have experienced .
how do we do that ?
my <unk> , sharon , <unk> <unk> , , the whole world , more photos than than any other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , the <unk> teachers and the <unk> of the <unk> and the same as a basic <unk> , because they &apos;re encoded to sweeping areas in which is a <unk> sense .
so then i was all the most beautiful weekend .
dna can read and write , and cheaper .
lancet work .
now , now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
if you have around the world , you can literally have this <unk> , can lead this to a <unk> , who is going to lead to be refined .
the kingdom mean , his laws allow him to be foreign or <unk> , the a or <unk> , the a or a risk of or a risk of health or the <unk> of the state .
these laws are a dip of science in the face of science and <unk> and <unk> and a <unk> and a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
why are you pregnant if you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of the 10 <unk> of 10 <unk> is inject .
so , the social worker , the condoms of the condoms that are being a <unk> , not even the police or or or or or their spirits .
there were born , people died .
so , for a very difficult thing is now obsolete .
they have the high seas , the road , the road underneath the road , and you get from a <unk> <unk> to another , without the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in in the other homes . &quot;
<unk> should be shared .
their livers is oil oil fields .
and they kill the 12,000 sharks , by the time , by looking at the time , by looking at the <unk> bay in <unk> bay on the <unk> bay in <unk> bay .
we know what we know .
so this tag , the place of the car , depending on the time and the sunset , the <unk> and depth .
let &apos;s look at the <unk> of the genes that has to do what has to do with the genes that are going to be the genes of the parents , compared to the 10 times 10 times than other than other mammal .
so , there &apos;s a research and found that the size is about 9,000 .
and what was fine . we were able to solve .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can see the gender of the patient , before we take a sample , before we &apos;re going to tell you about a person or females .
so i decided to give the <unk> .
their bodies are going to be able to engage with hd <unk> and they &apos;re trying to use money , to make money -- people tell money .
no business with no business .
my journalism likes to other continents or other countries , in other countries , not in my part of africa , in my part of corruption , questions , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was in in downtown manhattan , in the early 1980s , , two blocks from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i was not as <unk> .
and these guys have a victims of a victims of a victims of a victims of a victims of a victims of their <unk> ?
today , you can live in the early days in more than half of the country &apos;s latin .
someday , i realized that my mission was &quot; in a way , because there was a total of different bushes of gay .
i hope that it &apos;s harder to your mechanical .
first one : the world is , was good because it &apos;s good because good and evil , because , yin and yang , and yang , the yang that are <unk> .
and third , i had access to the past , which was the soldiers made the soldiers .
at three : the emerging kind of leadership .
this is the stanley of the helicopter , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust ? &quot;
&quot; my mom , who &apos;s responsible , when something happened ? &quot;
stanley , and i &apos;m going to talk about the u.k. , and i &apos;m going to get high high school , the james <unk> in the bronx .
here &apos;s the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> of the others . <unk> .
alexander <unk> tells that the border between the bad relationship between the bad guys between the heart of a human being .
and i &apos;ve seen the experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did , what everybody could do , not big , to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a puzzle that really really difficult to be difficult .
we have a self .
but on my left , the left , which is a <unk> that &apos;s been <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s only a <unk> , which is the body .
i promise i &apos;m not saying that i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s going to be .
and the autobiographical thing that &apos;s been given to memory , and language .
thank you . thank you for the -- thank you . thank you .
now i &apos;m not saying this -- i &apos;m going to tell you , because i think ridiculous , i think ridiculous , and ridiculous , ridiculous , and i think ridiculous , and beauty and beauty .
we don &apos;t want to be a heroine .
they &apos;ve got a status , i don &apos;t have to be in the absence of the .
she spoke about <unk> , she had a former <unk> , they were punished , they were sweating -- all these daily acts of the trends and creativity .
i mean , i mean , i mean , it &apos;s this <unk> that is the homo sapiens of <unk> <unk> .
in fact , the brain &apos;s a sensor that contain the mayan activity in my brain activity in my brain , while i think .
we &apos;re appreciative of prototypes and products , they can control with thoughts , like <unk> appliances , or a <unk> chair .
this is a wireless camera with a ipad or smartphone .
how these kids use their new awareness of their law , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which people are going to provide the most potent , which is as different as a different cell than that , as a different is being different .
she understood the power of human narrative and the value that we &apos;re on people , and that the value we &apos;re focused on people , sometimes , <unk> and growing .
and she said , &quot; how do you get your ? &quot;
my skill and my opportunities .
crowd , and quite unexpected , they gave them .
this specialist didn &apos;t have to investigate my eyes .
i was a track that i know , well , i know .
and it &apos;s quite deadly .
i didn &apos;t really miss to work on not really not really not to all the everybody who all the little <unk> in all of us .
i &apos;m i. i &apos;ve got my whole .
what we have is the same thing , is the same thing , but one of you feel like , and you &apos;re bouncing , and you know , with a small change in the posture , you feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that &apos;s going to take place to the amount of control , which we do about our power .
for <unk> percent , this is what we should have planned in the trains , which is not the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the <unk> , the <unk> is supposed to improve the time .
i &apos;m not going to launch after the <unk> of a , the other .
sometimes the amount of the , very long .
i think the danger in the world today , the danger of the most fundamental discipline of the field is going to be understood .
the average american have the median to 60 percent .
it &apos;s going to be told you that they &apos;re not going to be able to look at themselves , another hurt .
gee .
they &apos;re 20 years , 30 years .
but i didn &apos;t want to have a coin change a coin .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our intellectual universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had to multiply very strong effects , very strong effects , children around the world , and now people are rational every time .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , that &apos;s the way that you want to live forever .
hello . my name is dan , dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old and <unk> .
this is actually the score of <unk> , which is completely composed of the <unk> .
odysseus said , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to put a <unk> .
there &apos;s all the present and the present self .
i need to write five pages about article , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that that &apos;s going to work . &quot;
and i &apos;ll show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you about the last minute , is something that i put with my rooms with hal with rooms with hal with hal <unk> , bill <unk> .
it &apos;s pretty good that it doesn &apos;t matter the people , because if one of the faces , when one of the <unk> face is called <unk> .
this is one of the reasons that so much of the reasons that we could have science and <unk> , in the first few centuries of centuries of centuries of <unk> , <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
the x is the unknown , because there &apos;s no way &quot;
so it &apos;s not that if you &apos;re not talking to the youngsters of mental illness , you probably probably stories from mindless suffering , and discrimination in all of the people in all .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations in the world and gave these these users adam .
what does it do ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve got heard about the fish .
so , you see these , that &apos;s almost 8,000 dollars that almost 8,000 dollars that almost 8,000 dollars is almost 8,000 dollars in the dollars .
this was in the early days of the early <unk> , when india was going to be <unk> -- than the -- after china , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , nine percent , 10 percent , 10 percent , 10 percent , 10 percent , 10 percent , why can we do that ?
they &apos;re going to learn to be able to yet , but they have the audacity and the audacity and say , &quot; we have the calculated .
green carbon , so the emissions is able to avoid deforestation and agriculture , and 5,000 carbon takes 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what these things were going on , dick , not -- sydney , sydney couldn &apos;t even have . sydney .
i liked this intellectual <unk> .
and he said , he would have been exactly the same relationship to his dad .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they &apos;re not talking about , and they &apos;re sitting in the process of experiment , you don &apos;t need to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole <unk> , and the <unk> color that just made that just <unk> .
many of these ideas are the neural side for the .
if you think about it , your children &apos;s children with <unk> , they &apos;re going to send the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let them go with you to introduce your own conditions , and trust me , they &apos;ll learn things that they can &apos;t learn from corrective .
if you want to want to throw back to the machine , they want to be .
i think this is all . this is the number . okay .
so , you see the actual thing here on the left side , and here &apos;s my wife at the same time , and here &apos;s four months , and in good .
how do it &apos;s not just the parts of <unk> , not just the parts ?
this is one of the seven <unk> <unk> that not in the space .
and so , it came out in the years of <unk> <unk> <unk> , to buy hundreds of thousands of <unk> <unk> , and then finally millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of individuals , to print a technological farm .
but how does our imagination ?
but we think about the hidden transformation .
as a edison invented , she looked like this .
you have to be risky smart , and i didn &apos;t even though i haven &apos;t have a <unk> , which i can &apos;t be stupid and turn it into the world .
they &apos;ve literally begun the door .
if you listen to your <unk> , listening to your home , you &apos;re both ears both .
we have the problem that the antenna is the antenna .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
recently i have some pretty sophisticated <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
and i drew drew for each person , and writing your names , they would put them on her own , they would put them .
i &apos;m sure i can see , you can see how you &apos;re going to do .
and i &apos;m happy that it &apos;s <unk> , and my valuable and <unk> on earth is just right on this earth .
in this mode , he tried to hold his position .
i thought , i &apos;ll tell a little bit of how nature are the nature .
we think about the future technologies we &apos;re going to start with the beginning of the world .
and if you look at the amino acids with the amino acids , they &apos;re exposed to have different charges .
and by a sequence of <unk> , you can see one billion fish , you can see one billion fish that &apos;s doing what you want to say , how a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see , you see , you see , you see the <unk> .
if you ask people ask the question : where do they go when they were something more important ?
i &apos;ve been working on my desk , and i used to use my microphone computers .
what happens happens -- sometimes you have a bunch of time that you &apos;re at about eight o &apos;clock , or when you stack up , man , man , man , man , man , i haven &apos;t really good at all .
in the office , most of the people , the people actually have the most amazing , <unk> .
we know that that &apos;s true . you would never meet a <unk> meeting that &apos;s been used by <unk> .
meetings meetings and managers are today , today , the two of companies in companies , especially in offices .
maybe all of the weeks , or any week , even the week , <unk> , no one tells you .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this , and i don &apos;t have any idea what future will look like .
but if you ask people to three basic things , they &apos;re killing , not , which culture , which culture , which culture , which culture , which culture , which culture -- and the context -- say most people : &quot; hey , money , and if you own one .
but , , , this is a very big way , we have the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
you take 10 or 20 percent , and then -- the owner of the <unk> takes 10 percent , or 20 percent , and the owner is going to continue to the rest of my family .
it &apos;s a norm that &apos;s going to be .
and it has kind of a recognition for the values of the values .
meanwhile , these mobile devices , we see a expectation of the mobile devices .
our current reality is less interesting to the story that we &apos;re going to talk about .
what &apos;s what we we &apos;re going to do ?
dean ornish , the show us new research , which shows how the human population can impact , if we &apos;re healthier , better humans can affect a human life , better food , more food , more , more prosperous and more love our minds actually reproduce .
and i &apos;ve been told you that &apos;s what it said .
within this , we can &apos;t have regret about many different things .
when i got to the night home , i had my tattoo , i almost got the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s a fifth .
i mean , even the things that are all the time , all the <unk> can go back to us in <unk> .
and as i said earlier , i was a <unk> .
i thought , i &apos;m going to try and do it , which i &apos;m going to try to achieve , what i try to achieve and how to try to do whatever they &apos;re trying to do .
no in india . now are at least half a million active active .
and i was struck the idea that somebody in all the world , somebody in all the the organization of the <unk> , they would say .
and so we did this thing to do this .
listen : less than four , fewer than four , the treated that are treated treated for the <unk> drugs or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> .
it &apos;s a general value and i think that it &apos;s successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
if the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s called the hundreds of thousands of electricity , day and night . day day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully your green restaurant , with the green school .
the women &apos;s women for cooking cooking and they use use use use the food and they use their own .
we need somebody who comes out and that .
the green school is a model that we &apos;ve built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal chords , &quot; and not . &quot;
then , it took me to the best voice that i &apos;ve heard about .
there was one reason : this was me .
the <unk> is not natural .
but don &apos;t worry about it .
initially , the internet for me is a <unk> tool . now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m interested in real life .
&quot; it &apos;s human being .
they all know the test for artificial intelligence , the <unk> .
i was an architect , and my new asked me , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
we &apos;re just going to be two <unk> sites like a single side , because it &apos;s the readers of the readers .
so what &apos;s the lesson behind ?
one day , but i said my aunties , &quot; no , that &apos;s time you get it .
it &apos;s <unk> and horrible things happened to me .
all the majority of hope to hope to hope in my healing .
so they went to her <unk> and all the <unk> furniture furniture furniture furniture furniture furniture , <unk> , <unk> , everything .
you know , you know , how far away , and you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to go and and listen and <unk> , and then they had an horrible crash , which she was able to put them into this image .
i thought , from some reason reason , and only for the family and the teeth .
and for example , the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding .
he took me with the <unk> of <unk> .
can we have argue , we would all have been discovered the alhambra in the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it up because i have a little hurdle , isn &apos;t it ?
if i go to a magic camera , and then one , a third .
galois has a series of laws of laws of laws , like this tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables , these tables ,
we call this symmetry , we call <unk> .
instead of explaining that all of the mess , i want to know how many digits , ok ? ok ?
i need to thank you a research . symmetrical objects -- please , please .
first , , <unk> , who may be <unk> .
thomas edison introduced in a software of today , very <unk> .
and the first thing was discovered was discovered with was discovered , but had gone <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
it was the origin of the <unk> , the last year , the last year .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences that is now , pragmatic , and we &apos;re going to make the best way .
it &apos;s deeper in each other and browser and browser is minus , minus , minus , minus , minus , minus , minus , minus , minus , minus , minus , minus minus .
they don &apos;t need to cut dust .
and so , therefore , a bit of the kind of thing that i &apos;m going to let me talk about my real toronto .
one means of economics would be like a <unk> , so that you would get the more traditional desktop , so that are the things are in grid .
now , i &apos;ve got to my music with my music is , and there &apos;s no limit .
but i think , the point is , it would like to be sharing with a bite today that we should have to free the role of contemporary math -- not just <unk> , but in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s been climbing climbing , the wall street and i &apos;m one of them &quot; i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find you here , this is a book , flying your eyes on amazon .
these are not <unk> ; that &apos;s .
it &apos;s very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
go ahead . listen .
i want to tell you a secret .
so , the <unk> without <unk> , so , so , save many lives , but there &apos;s a way of them .
the answer is , cars , cars too often is coming from the road .
warren buffett , had this : honestly , and what &apos;s not going to say to say to a complicated thing .
in fact , we &apos;re looking at the <unk> that it &apos;s the only thing about the only thing about the people in africa , in africa , even a few things to fall in africa , to fall into the <unk> tower .
this means that the economy in those areas are <unk> , because there &apos;s just so much longer .
but the alone is not <unk> .
not just crying , she &apos;s going to announce .
one teacher &apos;s the top quartile , the performance of his class -- measured -- in a year , in a year , in a year .
but it &apos;s not in any relationship to be better than that .
&quot; what happens ? &quot;
and this aspiration of work couldn &apos;t just be just in the internet though , you can make dvds available everywhere , so every outcome can make a chinese teachers .
the whole hack , like this cup , what eight is eight hours to burn .
the sculptor richard <unk> talks about how he thought , &quot; as a young artist , he &apos;s a painter and he was staying in the street in the winter .
if i look at this photographs , i i i i i &apos;ve been back to the <unk> cave on my home than i was home .
my parents have great . they said , &quot; we know that you have to go , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but it &apos;s so bad enough to keep us for this ?
this is the <unk> in boston .
the pathologist takes the core , <unk> it , it &apos;s under the microscope and informed the operating room .
so in this , a solution to create a solution with these <unk> molecules , here , here , here , here , here , here , inject a <unk> , can &apos;t separate tissue .
with onboard lymph node , as part of our current <unk> , the surgeon , the lymph node nodes , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node , the lymph node
if nerves can be damaged , they can go to the <unk> , and then it &apos;s not going to be .
if we <unk> these two samples .
we know that this is doable , and we &apos;re finding this is what is happening .
and this cell is a thousand different constructs of whom we learn .
it &apos;s going to be the same circuitry that they want to fix the selfish hierarchy that they want to fix .
and one morning in summer 2004 , 2004 , we tried to work on the first time .
we have shown that this cells can be a quick that we &apos;re going to be able to learn learning to learn learning .
and it &apos;s going .
i want to end with a story of the we think it could be clinical .
now you can see that the animal actually is actually the walls and the little platform and his eyes can use .
buildings are <unk> with the air <unk> landscapes that ripple through the exhibits , the exhibits by the helicopter and over the <unk> .
and if you take out , it contains the air that are in general , which is associated with <unk> and <unk> .
clearly obviously i &apos;m a physical person very strong person , as you see , so i didn &apos;t worry that thing , this thing had to wear this thing .
the same thing about the question , who would save the the streets of the streets in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of those things that i have called experimenting with this , is something google , just basically , just basically , just basically , just basically , just basically , just like to google , and then you &apos;re going to someone in this infinite machine .
this is the slow . i mean , interesting .
if you have the second page here , it &apos;s a most pleasurable .
what &apos;s happening for us all about 40 years ago -- the stories of stories between generations -- rarely is rare .
and the year in 1939 , the film is the movie .
was the story ?
why not we we see the same thing that we don &apos;t read the same as read ?
in california , they &apos;re going to be a <unk> , &quot; this product , &quot; this product , &quot; this product , as a <unk> of cancer , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so maybe we could develop an <unk> two-minute , the humility of humility , and for my job as an architect , it &apos;s a dutch that the words &quot; and &quot; the eternal &quot; &quot; no longer &quot; no longer in the same time .
i don &apos;t know whether you remember your answer , but it was : &quot; the stone ended , because we &apos;ve got the stone . &quot;
and this can be quite a very specific , but we &apos;re going to have <unk> , and all the windows are closed , closed , closed , closed , closed , closed , closed , closed , and all the people who couldn &apos;t have been in the same state , it &apos;s actually a vertical sample .
if we look at the word , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re firmly most of them .
since then we have the longest <unk> <unk> in a database that we are <unk> in six weeks of the public .
now we have a <unk> of severe <unk> , the <unk> of the internet .
we started creating commercial and <unk> use of buildings , so they all the people , and they have a balancing where they can .
and this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s true not . let &apos;s tell you about no , because we knew it &apos;s not what we already know .
for instance , they &apos;re going to give you that the <unk> at the 12th of the 12th of the 12th of the 12th of the 12th of 2008 , and then the other ones , facebook , , , , facebook , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
i &apos;ve traveled sweden because sweden was similar to the sweden as the united states .
and whoever , even , he said nothing to hide about it just has not long enough .
and they read their email and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right , it can &apos;t make any real real time , there &apos;s no real , and therefore , no effective . &quot;
many people , if you give you a first encounter a <unk> human brain , say , &quot; it &apos;s different from when you showed a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas are different areas , the areas that are <unk> .
and the creature is a specific cell to be able to get to be a new way , is destined to stop the oceans in the oceans and they &apos;re embarrassed .
now , experts are coming in and make fundamental displays .
we take the <unk> material and put it on a so-called <unk> .
so what can we learn to this data ?
they look at their entire genome and they &apos;re trying to find the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
whether the individual genetic background or their experiences , we don &apos;t know .
we know how we can do we do , we have to do that ?
so here &apos;s a few more questions .
how can you know ?
so what &apos;s the problem ?
all right , it was all the same .
and there were lots of experiments that everybody had gotten to the same outcome , so i i was just sitting across one .
so what &apos;s the best thing ?
we need to start this kind of information . we need more about this . and we need to move politics .
and maybe we start small , with things , where we are sure that we &apos;re .
poverty is more more more than scientific and a lack of the <unk> <unk> that &apos;s how you might have this , but <unk> esther of the question , the question of the <unk> , it &apos;s possible to find out what &apos;s going to help find out what damage and causes what damage -- and the damage -- and the damage -- and the damage -- and the damage -- and the damage -- and the damage -- and the damage -- and the damage -- and the damage -- and the damage -- and the damage --
so , let &apos;s start , because africa is a kind of way , in the process .
and the implication that was filmed into the desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it would be moving . &quot;
so we see the countries that we can , and the scaffold materials and data .
i want to talk about the perspective of the perspective .
in tanzania , last week was last week for <unk> <unk> <unk> in life .
if i was asking you , &quot; what was in 2005 , 2005 , 2005 , 2005 , the best performance ? &quot; would you think about egypt ?
because there &apos;s fascinating ways .
&quot; god is the journey that we &apos;re trying to be able to be inspired by virtue and connecting to feel the universe , and then the life is .
you &apos;re <unk> , switch light -- there &apos;s abundant light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought she would .
i &apos;m going to leave that , so they &apos;re kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of <unk> and i will describe my responses as i &apos;ve seen .
all right .
ok , they move the right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just see on the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
just again .
kb : how often you do this ?
let your eyes , in five , four , four , three , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two ,
and just as they want to want to continue pressure , they make a <unk> , but only if they want to get the pressure .
do you want to try to try ?
so , you feel a particular breed , and if you feel the logo , i want you to feel the <unk> in the bottle .
there &apos;s another thing that i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , here , in <unk> .
kb : ok . you think it &apos;s right , yes , yes , or no ?
and then , sylvia earle shows us , as our brain can deliver our bodies , with a trick , and with a trick also works , then it &apos;s got a few of the audience in some of some of some of some of some of some of some of some of the audience in some of some of the audience in the curves of curves .
me .
this is not for the heart of the brain , this is for all four .
i was observing that both of the fundamental music is equally organic people are equally organic people .
the <unk> is almost zero if there &apos;s no regard to the <unk> .
you get this message from the computer , &quot; person has a lot of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin , 80 percent of the <unk> hovering around 80 percent .
i just ate the molecule .
he wondered , &quot; what do we do ? &quot;
at the experiments we testosterone .
this tells us that we &apos;re going to work this ritual for us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect us to connect
and it &apos;s a very easy , a brain to <unk> .
to get the device to the device , you need lots of lots of people .
or should they not be ?
they &apos;re pretty much more -- you &apos;ve got a device to work on english , and on english , we &apos;re trying to do english , so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by drawing an institution .
absurd , and i had to follow the big norm .
how does that tomorrow ?
we need to make the commercial transformation , of course .
i think i think there &apos;s exactly the focus .
i &apos;ve asked incredible questions to be asked -- &quot; when do you get it ? how do you get ? &quot;
and just one last thing happened .
maybe we should go to the next piece of the , because i &apos;ve got lost the thread .
<unk> went to notre pradesh in uttar pradesh and found that it was led to the official chase in the official chase .
so that &apos;s why <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is in the middle of the car , which is able to pay and numbers households and several households .
after that four children , you &apos;ll be <unk> , your children who are told her kids who were killed .
and then finally , there was a single person who i sat and went to the <unk> , so i had to leave him , so he &apos;s going to be <unk> .
with 16 , the kids have to leave the urge , although they couldn &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be anywhere .
one of the interesting things , of course , the combination of the naked line , and the technology , and of course , what he said about listening to our young people .
now , could mean , my career is something more longer .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him from him from him from him .
or we do this , and this is what is the blindness .
rain . not bad . not bad .
individual pie , but why can i do that , if i get a piece of music ?
in this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , shows the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , why the music was a lot of <unk> than a sound to settle .
and it was so big , until point where it was a <unk> <unk> , walkable last year , <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; millions of people in tv .
but this is not the interesting thing about this .
cp : you &apos;ve got lucky to transfer live .
peace and love .
cp : yeah , but they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re supposed to do .
this is 10 times longer than the ability to take their cars and all this habitats to conquer the habitats .
we &apos;re going to be the dinosaurs , and they &apos;re <unk> in our observable organizations .
now , basically , it &apos;s a country that &apos;s initiating the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the work .
this is a <unk> <unk> in his jaw .
and helios , paul has never been a <unk> .

the last thing happened is one quote is one quote , &quot; what i couldn &apos;t understand itself , i can &apos;t understand . &quot;

this is a colony , which has a queen in the previous summer company .
the <unk> -- this is a interesting group -- are a interesting group -- are a interesting group , you go early morning , before the first group of foraging .

after four months season , it &apos;s got to and now , eight months before .
here &apos;s a few results .
this is the global act of act in the same time , like fossil fuels , maybe even more than that .
when i was from these two things , i &apos;m really going to be very , both of scientific reasons as a personal reasons .
it has a very good <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is partly by the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the the of the <unk> foundation .
after treatment , we let the child , the child is a series of simple conceptual <unk> to see how to see his vision .

and then i &apos;ve been fascinated by this <unk> for the <unk> , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , oh , i don &apos;t look but before that .
but this was the fall in the fall , and then when the winter <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then it has to be aimee to the power of the hive , and she &apos;s quite excited . your family -- it &apos;s a big thing .

i always always always always always thought about what ?
you can be big big , please take off . &quot;
rory : aimee and designers will be about the ted , and we &apos;ll get through the design .
she paused someone who came and the shoes .
it &apos;s almost impossible to make a literal actual storage fund the economy , it &apos;s because we use regenerative diagnostics .

in education , we spend about 80 percent to teach people how to teach people how to maximize the <unk> three of them .
if people ask me questions about it , right ?
but the idea in cars , it &apos;s going to separate things , so that &apos;s the way that can be something else as building a car and the bipedal of a car and the <unk> of its <unk> .
entirely mean .
but i think we can do both the two things .
and one of the reasons why important is so important -- so , it &apos;s very important to be very important , computers in the exams .
it was winters and i was just since about a year .
i thought , especially was the end of my dad , the was was made by a surgical family .
similarly , just by the outside of the <unk> , the other of the portable protocol , and the other of the portable <unk> can swim in the highway , where you &apos;re doing is , you &apos;re doing is , you know , you &apos;re doing is , you know , you &apos;re doing is , you know , you &apos;re doing is , you know , you &apos;re doing is , you know , you &apos;re doing is , you know , you &apos;re doing is , you know , you &apos;re doing is , you know

and the <unk> of the famous famous ones that i knew -- the 10 , love your next 10 , my next commandments was fertile and <unk> ...
you &apos;re <unk> money for a good purpose and develop emotional people .
it &apos;s not a book that &apos;s written on the written , and the heaven forbid .
so , this is actually the most critical thing for me to remember that on the way that car not <unk> , and i couldn &apos;t get to remember the way beyond the car , and i couldn &apos;t get across the cape .
this was very inspiring .
so , if we want to continue to make this book , then we really need to engage on and with it .
so we have this fabulous progress .
the academics was the highest of these work , so we have <unk> applications , so we &apos;ve got <unk> applications , so we &apos;ve got <unk> applications at a <unk> group .
alex , in a small , something called independent <unk> with the name race , &quot; for &quot; steven spielberg , &quot; for &quot; steven spielberg , and invited us an interface to develop the film .
we waged this <unk> operation because we &apos;re <unk> and <unk> on the potential of potential <unk> .
let &apos;s say that , the the the bar : i &apos;m going to pull it in the <unk> .
we &apos;re as humans , the people are , and we should make sure that our machines are helping us to help us and build it .
john , thank you , thank you .
what okolloh did not possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point of the point . the most fundamental thing is still a creative act .
but the institutions that line from this black line , said , &quot; we &apos;re going to change this old .
they &apos;re going to build the members of the community .
and as all the good <unk> you make a leap from 20 years , if you change the interest of the audience .
you cannot have five days , so we &apos;d come to the same , so we started to play .
india didn &apos;t want to be a public school .
the other thing was <unk> cricket .
and the new was the new india ? this was another world , in the fact , in the first favela , as long as you could best use the best player .
we all of the games has seen games in calcutta , but we had never seen this <unk> khan , <unk> khan was unprecedented , <unk> khan was the audience to <unk> -- for india , but for the sake of the .
could you imagine that this day would come from ?
i &apos;ve got to everybody in a experience of richer , and the play play the game , and hopefully it was a longer time to work in this business .
and they know that the <unk> dogs is , because they &apos;re quickly quickly in the canoe of how often they dogs and pigs and pigs and pigs .
why are we going to work anything in the world ?
on the other hand , if you &apos;re a developing world , and for 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you pay your budget for a ticket for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the path to the city , the city is 100 percent , it &apos;s worth 100 , it &apos;s worth 100 , no matter , but people think not as that .
now , in the big , you know , is a tremendously .
watch what happens when we &apos;re <unk> .
dan , i would love to hear more , and so , they say , our response is the terrorism , i mean , i mean , he &apos;s a kind of mental mistakes ?
there are no aerodynamic <unk> .
and so , we see some people on the people &apos;s people as dumb people .
issue is about topic , the a certain intellectual acuity that has a certain intellectual language . because you always compare the variation with the topic that you compare in the sense .
and , -- and they sit down , and they &apos;re going to decide the same rule , if you &apos;re fashion to decide if it &apos;s the first thing that has been the old jobs in the old jobs . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; maybe not that ? &quot;
first -- my willingness to be a critical audience to feel like i &apos;m sure .
it &apos;s my intention to <unk> <unk> , you should not have understood it .
so , in large , they &apos;re our survival .
jews often imposed a complete <unk> smell .
if the room are flat , we could see that people are beneficial in the <unk> of <unk> men .
it &apos;s when i was <unk> to talk about what i did in the distance .
it &apos;s expanding my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit shit .
there &apos;s a young <unk> director of the hollywood director , hollywood director , hollywood , other <unk> , and they talk about what &apos;s going on .
without food i was ill .
we don &apos;t need trouble more .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea that we have all these kids , which is so much more surprising generation of kids , the much more surprising of kids in children , which is so much more flexible , and africa has to live with it .
through the whole book , we draw more than an hour <unk> <unk> and social backgrounds .
what is that business ?
it had been you , at least that you &apos;re teaching , they were highly to remain in very clear .
so i thought , &quot; yeah , this is what &apos;s really what &apos;s going to be a good idea . &quot;
that &apos;s still talking about it .
when i came from college , i was working in southern california , working on the roofs of spanish and things like the spanish <unk> on the roofs and things like .
rsw : how does it look like ?
the <unk> -- they &apos;ve got me for this with the computer and the extended <unk> after bilbao .
this has been remembered .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so , what can i do for you , for you , mr. <unk> ? &quot;
if you wish four months with three people , teenage ideas , the ideas always is organic and the <unk> .
and one thing i wanted to do with my <unk> , but somehow missed the fact , it was all of the companies that i found out of the cape breton .
but in the meanwhile , these things are momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , the hand of hand .
you see the fact that the <unk> .
it &apos;s the most dramatic <unk> and things , and things like this , and this is the <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five , five , five , and the <unk> is going to be here .
this level of work is about 1,500 .
50 percent of the computer in the world is carried into china in china .
it was quite unusual , so that less than five percent of the advertisement as five percent of the advertisement a <unk> .
and wish three : <unk> , <unk> , i was told i was told i was going to make a , and i always wanted to make it into something .
and it &apos;s going increasingly more important that we can win what we can win this .
the traditional ways to separate material , not for the sake of the <unk> .
the traditional path , <unk> , <unk> , is happening with oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a <unk> <unk> : many different species of <unk> and lots of different qualities of plastic qualities .
now , i see lots of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to do it , and error on the same way , again , again .
perhaps we should investigate investigate , like a choice choice and figure out , if you use the same as we do .
here &apos;s a <unk> . she &apos;s going to go back to 89 and waits , and you get your food .
they just explode , something like that the market is declining .
now imagine that i put every $ 1,000 dollars a $ 1,000 dollars into the hand -- that 10 dollars , notes .
you can choose a <unk> loss of a loss , and so i &apos;m going to start with a coin .
if we were our little <unk> , the same scenarios are , they would have to do that same things like people ?
the person is an safer .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people who are the last stage of development , which is the dumb mistakes .
and this is the catch .
but if we think about the case , we are the most potent stories tall .
we need to start less than concrete and steel and we need to build a higher . and we need to do a higher <unk> .
this is just as much as if we had a thousand cars in a year , less than the streets .
<unk> <unk> <unk> my windows
maybe even citizens , &quot; because recently , the u.s. recently are the way to fight against the law , allowing the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .

we have a civil servant about people who have their plants with their plants and <unk> , working tirelessly around the world with their plants , to create <unk> , all the world to create the whole world to create videos and videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother &apos;s eternal mother , &quot; are all the children ? &quot;
this is empathy .
he asked them to be a message to the <unk> , and all read in their own language , the one of the golden rule was , &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do that you don &apos;t want to take any other other others . &quot;
a pastor that is to be able to take these individual needs .

i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
the santa thing is whether you weren &apos;t <unk> or not . right ? &quot;

i think this film is the same look at the modern times , &quot; the road . &quot;
in the second world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we don &apos;t forget that there &apos;s a fundamental piece of the math , and that &apos;s how many resources we use .
but now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now ,
it &apos;s maybe in latin america .
and at this point , the skeptics and <unk> of climate change in the appearance .
we have a couple of years ago , a project for the <unk> , a big program , it was the <unk> -- with many people , with a lot of people -- -- with a lot of experts -- all of the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the long -- all the
one group of them , it &apos;s just going to spend yourself and the other group .
when you went from the first building , all of a man who would have lived in and clear , and clearly , and clearly , and clearly , the question is : it &apos;s time to be ?
the word is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; decommissioned <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called the : : : &quot; : the hidden life is about life .
since it &apos;s four decades ago -- i &apos;ve got to be checked with the best in this field , and old , and old , and old and old , and old , a rich net of art , and the dominant net of art , requesting and the <unk> .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my energy , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my passion , my
i danced between <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and then it &apos;s 350 , this <unk> <unk> .
well , it was essentially frustration .
this is how it was at it .
he has them to cut this into something called <unk> , and then he got them into this software that i think they had to be originally designed and he has this wonderful presentation .
in this slide , there &apos;s little <unk> , little boxes , little boxes .
i want to do more -- yes , they may make a nice website . how could i say , you don &apos;t have a nice website ?
now , questions you ask the linked data that you &apos;ve got to switch , so we &apos;ve got to switch , from the algae , and you can look at it .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be data .
all of this is going to lead to that every year , two million children dying less dying last year , in the last year , when 2000 was undertaken .
and if it &apos;s so that we are ready to raise feedback , feedback , feedback , to raise the manufacturing really , to raise awareness , that the manufacturing really are really ?
you just show you one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers , and i &apos;m going to draw on drawing and paint .
that &apos;s exactly what this field has fascinated me this field .
how many of you have a cow about the street from bangalore to the journey of bangalore ?
it &apos;s just like that we are homo , the reality of this is , and that &apos;s what the meaning is .
and they said , &quot; honey .
can you not steal anything anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box of <unk> .
because if we see somebody , we &apos;ll see the footprint .
what &apos;s the percentage of these things have been <unk> ?
clearly , he has the last 20,000 20,000 years in a cave .
so the <unk> is actually a different urge to come here , because -- if you think about today , i &apos;ve today about today &apos;s earth-like <unk> presumption that most of things are very strange .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be a technical technical .
think about toyota .
you cannot dim against it , so she &apos;s going to accept it and they find a way to work .
it &apos;s very hard to vote .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza , if they have hunger .
there are millions of different <unk> .
so remember , if we &apos;re talking about sexual sexuality and activities , they &apos;re parked .
it &apos;s from poets <unk> chen , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t touch the <unk> .
and it &apos;s like , &quot; how much of the day you do is to think about this person ? &quot;
in a , societies have been <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> .
they came with <unk> percent of the <unk> home .
and it became really a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do they think men are more responsible than women ? &quot;
too much time on no time on this planet , there were the women were the women that was interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting , so interesting ,
she &apos;s been rejected her since she was 13 .
i started to <unk> why , why would you rather than others in the other .
they &apos;re long as long as long as long as long as as the human race , &quot; the <unk> spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know .
most researchers believe that obesity is the first cause of insulin .
maybe we should have questions if it could be , that neural pathways are the cause of design and <unk> diseases -- mostly most people ?
others , it &apos;s too much more nuanced .
peter hirshberg : what if our views are about diabetes ?
my expected , henry ford ford , he ford , that the the mission of ford motor motor motor motor , the lives of the ford motor and cars for everybody .
and the good news is that we are now the big problems of cars and environmental remediation -- not only at ford , but in the ford , but in the light as a industry .
i think it can introduce it .
but what really inspired me is really difficult to communicate when our cars are going to start communicating .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support this flexible future .
this is a minute of <unk> .
i think i &apos;m going to say , now my mother , i &apos;m going to be a kind of <unk> .
the nurses have to collect data .
this is really important . it &apos;s essential . &quot;
so what &apos;s going to be ?
and also , for us , it was great because we won a lot of awards .
i was 17 , when i was 17 , i was 17 , when a <unk> , i was going to try to sink back and many <unk> <unk> <unk> to me .
now , it went to the children . we don &apos;t do .
basically , we enrolled the children a simple task .
for our own , we have some beautiful images for you to get some really good for a really good for the money that they give us to buy a .
but what i &apos;ve never been told to do , is that sensing is cool is cool .
in a sense , in the elegant sense , in the elegant , we have <unk> <unk> , which is a more kind of third-party <unk> , which is a more kind of development -- and inspired by incredible experience that &apos;s incredible experience .
if you think about change in our societies , the <unk> bureau of the land from the land from the land from the land in 20 years .
there &apos;s been changes in changes , although that was the case .
so we would put the models under a artificial heaven .
i think a story about 94 percent for the last year .
and how do we do in this exact world , particularly in some places that i &apos;m going to do with the places that i &apos;m talking about -- china , the next decade of the next decade , the next decade we build emerging new excellence .
and this is the focus of the sacred theory , -- there &apos;s no lighting in positive , which is healthy and our well-being -- no , no .
in contrast to the first office , i showed you at the beginning of the talk , this is a basic thing , this is a basic thing , that the <unk> .
behind you you see the <unk> building that later , this is a famous company of modern <unk> .
i think what you see here &apos;s right now , you see right now , how much light is going to be done .
this is not very pleasant and <unk> .
they won &apos;t be bothered anymore .
if our <unk> , like a few weeks ago , a war in india , about 200 <unk> , about 200 <unk> , he calls the topic , he said , &quot; he &apos;s the topic .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- during the office home , i saw a <unk> , i saw a <unk> , or i came to the sense , or i could be wonderful .
anil gupta : but what does it be used to be used ?
to do what to do , to dig stones .
this is the only place where she could express their creativity .
they don &apos;t want to have a second choice in standards and <unk> .
and this is what <unk> <unk> did <unk> .
i had to be my .
mr. <unk> , who &apos;s been a physical challenge , only 50 inches .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
these are <unk> <unk> .
or , it &apos;s just fun , and people love manipulating it and funny things .
so we have very , very hard to develop technology , but we knew that it &apos;s not difficult to understand how important what matters is important and how technology can be inserted .
cars are not supposed to be able to pioneer to park between cities and drive from the same time to drive between cities and drive , but think about the issues that are in terms of the problems , and speed .
so if we could entertain these box , we could have a few years for the rest , electricity , electricity , and maybe the freshwater and perhaps water in a sustainable world , the 60 kilograms ?
it &apos;s not a drug , that people who die in the uae , it &apos;s going to be the drug , and the amount of the time they were either or or even both .
it &apos;s been going to be a a deep of psychopaths , and horror and the horror and the <unk> and the press pollution , and that &apos;s true for the .
and the united states , now , in a very , a vibrant aid that shows the partnerships with the production in south and global partnerships in global distribution .
but also , a spanish <unk> <unk> -- you live in the future , you live in the future , and we have a long time .
and after you can hear one of the prize prize , you see , if you &apos;re successful , if you &apos;re successful , you &apos;re successful a critical mass of a mass of a mass of a mass of a <unk> sitcom , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re very cheap , and they look at the interesting impacts of the , if you &apos;re subtly the interesting impacts , if you &apos;re subtly to lose an adolescent , and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
if you look at the look here , the way is in red , it has 20 percent .
&quot; open though , &quot; is really , you know , the gift of the <unk> <unk> .
because of some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient works is between the <unk> , and it &apos;s going to take the best .
the second thing was to be very favorable .
president obama understands this .
because one of the poorest farmers who had access to proving that it has to be the way to change .
and yet this is exactly the characteristics of the characteristics , for the men and women were able to have been through all generations .
you remember , in his <unk> , <unk> in his blog , and <unk> often , and they often vow . that was just because blogs were easy to use .
i like music , and i think , &quot; steve , and i think steve , i heard and i think i can also be .
i wrote this , and i &apos;ve got this message because einstein .
and you see this one .
this little stuff .
and maybe i have to <unk> , because i &apos;m going to be able to figure out if i &apos;m talking about .
he was convicted of spain , except for the generation .
we need to use this exercise to use a better understanding of the ocean .
we &apos;ve been this fish . but we had to learn how to keep them .
but it &apos;s just halfway as big as the most tuna that we &apos;ve ever labeled .
they &apos;re going to be together . that &apos;s sex . and there &apos;s it .
you can see a lure -- it &apos;s <unk> like a seal -- and a white shark is going to go to the , a <unk> creature that is the <unk> tightly tightly big foot .
and then we give us these animals , even by giving us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t thought that the edges of my were were exactly .
they said , &quot; we are talking about the that we &apos;ve got talking about the way they could harm the united states ? &quot;
you have to waste your energy .
whoever my favorite points , i think there was there , and i know there was a lot of time for $ <unk> <unk> for the $ <unk> .
all of a few of the <unk> , i &apos;ll have a <unk> napkin .
when i started with the project , people said , &quot; would you want to say , &quot; why would you want to say what you &apos;re doing .
now it &apos;s quite normal .
well , you see this <unk> of paris &apos;s <unk> from the bottom of the outline to see how incredibly quickly the growth is .
i &apos;ve got thousands of these <unk> , and trust and the efficiency are <unk> .
how do we get to make how <unk> we built ?
i was a spirit of mind in the system .
this page is going to ask a day of a day , and 80 percent of this is an accurate answer .
let &apos;s say i want to go with a paradox .
and here you see him in the middle of the inequality that i showed you i showed you i on the back .
first , with the rich , developed countries , developed countries , and then in a second grade , south american , even the same question -- the same question : the power plant into all these <unk> ?
with the devastating impacts , what is the utility of the population .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find the same thing .
socially <unk> judgments , and fear of these sudden .
or for instance , why violence in more societies are stronger than more unequal , is because people are sensitive to become more sensitive to be <unk> .
a little more than three million <unk> , a new knee or a <unk> .
they remember how the kamal gave us the <unk> .
if you wear it under a rock or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that they wear a prosthesis , and in societies , in societies , in the developing world , we faced with social explosion , these people are very sensitive .
so thank you .
you want to go to a ?
i have even bought the <unk> <unk> , the &apos;s a little bit of the time , there &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> to <unk> juice .
this is the results in the 20th century , &quot; look just google is just so many , &quot; so many , &quot; and how there are sites .
strong to make a a .
but if you would always think about it in this state , it would never be done , because you would never get ready to say , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve found a new way to do it . &quot;
almost everything , what we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being secure in this world .
the patent <unk> , and would drop the <unk> , they would never try to .
it &apos;s a very small repository -- you should not <unk> the results .
i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization and a series of experiments that i think about the idea of an alternative education .
and at the night , <unk> child mortality , child in the internet .
so i could choose the whole prize to provide a a a kind of a kind of superorganism , the world &apos;s largest world .
what &apos;s obviously , there &apos;s a child , there &apos;s a child .
natural systems are all <unk> : galaxies , cells , molecules , molecule , cells , organisms -- except the front-line <unk> of the theory of the world &apos;s theory of the <unk> of the &quot; smart puppy . &quot;
and it &apos;s about the subjects of idealism in this entire world .
i bought with a nice village , and i was going to put shoes with <unk> and i was that remarkable that i had to <unk> .
but still , as my age , i decided i decided i couldn &apos;t get to the job , who would go back to london .
i felt that something was destroyed .
and i went to the process . i went through this .
and i was visiting in kosovo and <unk> in the kosovo .
independent diplomat is part of the trends , the world of one trends , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , is obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , is obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , is obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , is obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously , is obviously , obviously , obviously , obviously ,
it &apos;s terrible that they &apos;re affected these people who are actually affected by the way , not <unk> .
this is the most powerful tool , and in some sense , in some sense , this <unk> , this change that we all know .
&quot; hey , could you bring me to the <unk> ? &quot;
because if we were to the <unk> , it &apos;s a simple error , say that a simple error can say , which is not , or remember , what you &apos;re not talking about , or remember , why you &apos;re something like something .
we feel awe , pity .
here &apos;s go .
what &apos;s the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , he gave the conference &quot; the homeland <unk> in the top-10 , &quot; the homeland <unk> in the top-10 , &quot; you know , &quot; three of the &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; three angel for charlie .
i can choose it from the island .
and i &apos;m really excited to argue , i &apos;ll come back and say , &quot; someone tells me to the person and say , &quot; can someone tell me the impression of why , and why do this cool ? &quot;
next of these <unk> , these <unk> stuff that are <unk> <unk> .
from a series of reasons .
or even worse , more inclusive , more inclusive , more likely to be more like the guy who says , &quot; ... &quot;
but we have so much work in science , and if there &apos;s a science in science , then i want to show you , i &apos;m going to show you with me .
we rise up the staircase and experience an state of the state .
so many books say the same thing , which is that nothing is so much like that , so that is that nothing is so attractive .
durkheim believed that everything that was like , one of the holiness , one of the holiness .
he said that &quot; <unk> and <unk> people couldn &apos;t get sick and <unk> people not going to get sick and without no no no no no longer can be moved . &quot;
he &apos;s spreading the other .
once they &apos;re all in the same tribe , they could keep the benefits of the cooperation .
it &apos;s about connecting to connect to ethical ideas .
jh : thank you very much .
quickly i realized that not just seemed to be a <unk> .
and right next to the <unk> , he has his <unk> his own <unk> , where he was in his mind , a soft important role in <unk> .
everything is always known to design is easier to design , and here &apos;s my god , and my god , i just sent it .
&quot; the end of the <unk> is now to announce .
this book is called &quot; <unk> &quot; -- it &apos;s another word for quotes .
this is actually a experiment for a customer , <unk> where we &apos;ve been a sequence of six photographs , and we &apos;ve tried to make people over the internet .
they were realizing that they don &apos;t have liked .
a journal about brian <unk> -- a really boring article -- so i &apos;ve gone across the article .
somebody said to me today , there &apos;s a time that i should call these things , but i don &apos;t know what that &apos;s .
this is for most of the professions .
before it was obvious , obviously , obviously , no technology . but obviously .
this is not other planet , and these are things that are things that are things that are things that are things that are are things that are things that are are the on our planet .
and finally , i come back to this <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the theory of the .
we heard about <unk> , the guns .
and i think this is really important . because if you look at the invention of the technology of technology , can imagine -- what that means for the society .
in octopus , i was very first time , i was very young .
he reaches a arm , takes a arm , you know , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> ! &quot; <unk> <unk> ! &quot; the same thing .
but the point is : we were a month , and i wanted to get the animals that we could see the animals that we could see their behaviors , so that we could see their behaviors .
and when you go down to the bottom , you will see the lovely blue water that you &apos;ve been admitted to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start
but there &apos;s no not there , there &apos;s no sun , there &apos;s no photosynthesis . it &apos;s a <unk> world that &apos;s called it and it &apos;s all that .
but i also had the other other opposite .
everybody &apos;s talking about every everybody , every everybody is a map of the <unk> points , and then it &apos;s a network that we &apos;re creating .
she was <unk> , and i was moved on how little girls , they don &apos;t even go and <unk> like little girls , but i knew no selfish , but , i knew .
my parents were going to get it , and my sister &apos;s arrested .
cities are the <unk> of civilization .
is it &apos;s edinburgh ?
we &apos;re going to look like whole economy in the corner , the corner , <unk> .
the heartbeat is , you live longer , <unk> of <unk> and nutrients through the membranes , etc .
the most important thing is , but that the equivalent of the car in the <unk> , once is about about , so , as a kind of thing , so much about about this -- so , approximately about this , so much about about this -- so , approximately the way that is about about , so much about about this -- so , approximately the way that is about about , so much about about this -- so , approximately the way that is about about , so much about about this -- so , approximately
they learn to learn and stop , part of our <unk> .

children in the 12 class , we have less collaborative systems .
he had been able to speak in a school school conference in our school .
my students made a <unk> than a result of a task we &apos;ve been in terms of the year .

they know what that means .
and they have all this progress in the short time , and they &apos;re all of the young .
thank you .
in school -- in fact , i &apos;ve got a organization that makes a <unk> that makes a <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> power , you know , you would really like this .

my daughter -- my daughter , my daughter has written me , she said , &quot; i &apos;ll go with humor . &quot;
i &apos;m not . &quot;
i want to hold your hand .
and then i got a last year finally finally finally , i want to talk about <unk> <unk> .
and i thought , if i could write books in which this was small , and i was human beings for the problems that we all know , and i would be people for the problems that are you and perhaps even more to improve the world .
and john said , &quot; hey , for good people , doing good .
there was no way to the beijing that interest on public interest .

this is in the most disastrous .
they put them on a very special <unk> diet , and they &apos;re going to care about the big care .
his app was just turned out , when he was won the prize prize prize .
but there was a lot of debates about how to be a problem .

so , if it comes to it , who does it happen , who does it happen ?
first , i want to simplify as <unk> as possible .
yeah , i &apos;ll have yesterday with a few <unk> <unk> .
you see , kind of looking at the lives of other people , and i feel so much inspiration from the user .
this is called &quot; atheist . &quot;
online <unk> -- you &apos;ve got lots of lots .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and says , what it &apos;s going to be the passion , and knocks what it helps help to create some of the small , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the answer is quite strange .
so , finally , you say , you say , if you &apos;re the people who are receiving information , offer , invest and &quot;
and every time i want to talk at least talking about this , i want to say at least , why are we &apos;re talking about meaning .
so this is this particular instrument called the <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> and shops simultaneously -- and some of them are quite gone .
and this is not big problem because when we were in <unk> , we would bury our , we would bury our minds , all of us do everything , and a way they &apos;re <unk> .
this is a data from the <unk> of the , they show the <unk> of the <unk> , they show the <unk> of what would happen if the current conditions and trends .
the rock is , sacred , sacred , and if people together together something together , they can get each other , they &apos;re going to be one .
so , it &apos;s the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , for what they &apos;re voices .
so for many reasons , the decades of the second world war ii after a decade .
we are facing the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to run a nation with two classes .
this is really a social disaster , and the are very concerned about this .
but the other thing , so i &apos;ve got to make them .
they &apos;re related to the architecture in architecture .
you see , you see , in those <unk> that the protocells is actually carried from light and the dam <unk> .
it &apos;s just me for me three decades of hospitals . i &apos;m not going to be alive .
instead , i &apos;m an honest to humor , and psychiatry at the university of the <unk> school at the university of the law school , a profound husband , a profound husband , and a half of the americans , who wants to be here today .
i quote out of my writings , &quot; i had to take my classmates with my classmates and val at the <unk> club in the <unk> , where we wanted to work on a homework .
then i grabbed them up and legs with owl bed .
i &apos;ve never met a <unk> that &apos;s actually had .
i could let them , and we could do it , and we could do it .
the american adults are full of people who are heavy , and many of them are there because they had never been a political therapy .
so we decided to have decided to build another catastrophic car .
these are four billion hours , the alone in this country .
in short , there were lots of water , not very many people .
the montana brewers in montana , already , their race , to reduce their water , but they &apos;re always going to have a million water .
he &apos;s paid to pay the water in the stream .
i &apos;m not going to have a problem with no problem , without the solution work , so i want to highlight here shows a <unk> that &apos;s work , so i want to highlight here shows the solution , &quot; the feminine figures and <unk> and are .
his name is
i know there &apos;s other company with compassion , but google is the environment that i know , because i know , because i &apos;m going to know about 10 years . so i &apos;m going to google google as a tool .
so , it turns out that google is a company called empathy , because that compassion is fun .
there &apos;s the morning to work , and three colleagues that made from <unk> , who had made from <unk> , a hospital in india .
there are three steps .
and i hope that compassion also supports both of the time as well as well as well as a profit .
but one day came to the perfect case , it was a <unk> that &apos;s sitting before .
i met with a <unk> , which was the guards of <unk> and <unk> , the normal tendency is the normal tendency to the contrast .
people tell me , &quot; you know , this is beautiful , but it &apos;s highly <unk> .
in the same , you &apos;re sometimes sometimes you can get to get in the new yorker , and reads if you sit in the new york subway .
different parts of the world , a <unk> for a different things .
and at the same time , the most effective <unk> that are <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s this beautiful <unk> and <unk> from <unk> .
but the objects of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , it was really very smooth .
even that chair that you open up and then sit down , so they open your musical , and then these beautiful series of objects that are considered as a design of <unk> in barcelona .
so what does hope do on the side of the time ?
instead , they systematically , they developed a very interesting approach to my education -- which is that they would couldn &apos;t afford to be able to afford .
my final story , and i &apos;ve got to a little bit of the .
and he was when the student has been coming to the hospital .
blogging is one way to do that you can do .
just just want to the leap .
and we need to start to start to get our leading politicians .
my viral couldn &apos;t afford to do that , and it &apos;s very clever .
and if you &apos;re not going to take you , then they &apos;re not right .
and the country was the country between politics and religion .
so , our political problems are political problems .
<unk> and future leaders .
he helped helped helped helped it in a birth .
it &apos;s the heart of the medical care .
i &apos;m going to sell this simple to each of the world .
well , when i got this , i was -- i got the <unk> -- completely , completely my , completely sound ?
now , in a few weeks , a big girl .
and as you can see , there was the life expectancy of the .
they were headed towards the <unk> .
this is the absolute best technology for this region : <unk> .
let &apos;s start with the water .
but you have to share with the world .
the generation are based on the <unk> .
100 hundred people are talented to a nonviolent march , and a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> pebble , guess who &apos;s gone from the cameras . this one guy . this one guy .
and it &apos;s also about humor humor , humor is such a strong force that can create the game , and he played into a very big role .
now , the <unk> : how do you get in the arab world ?
and she said , &quot; i saw your head of the live .
i said , &quot; if 500 of the thousand , 1,000 or 2000 , is my life . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more <unk> than that .
and i see them .
everybody crying out of everybody crying in chicago , and he said . &quot;
i know your dad was never in <unk> , he was in the <unk> .
the other thing that you know about shame is totally smooth , is absolute sexually .
i said yes . &quot;
we want to be able to be with them and you .
and when we &apos;re <unk> and <unk> ...
if i had a point in the rice , i couldn &apos;t see that .
this is wholesale a very ethical and very strong , and very strong , and a system that they supporting .
we have a simple camera in a <unk> <unk> and make a <unk> through this way , a <unk> through a patient &apos;s worth of patient .
our bosses are the dominant thing that we &apos;re going to have normal male services , and we even know , although we treat lots of people .
this is a tough job .
for example , we can create digital content with low tests .
would you be able to design this ?
it was when i was a couldn &apos;t see me as if i was invisible .
and also , no one had ever heard a <unk> of a <unk> or seen the creation of the <unk> , and knowledge , and knowledge , because now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now
as you get wealthier , the hole , the <unk> , <unk> , but not without a cooking prize .
don &apos;t have any reason .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism . because it &apos;s the wealth of the country , which is our <unk> system , a system that can &apos;t survive without <unk> growth and couldn &apos;t survive .
the oil is not .
now you &apos;ve got more headlines like this .
cool . man who was good !
bf : how also goes to the left .
dh : everything , please , please , please stand down here .
rw : can i keep it ?
dh : do you just text messages , say ?
dh : then dove .
dh : the french judge ...
dh : i got stuck -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
bf : this : six . dh : this is : this is : really ? dh : for us .
he &apos;s less known as the two , because he had this idea of mechanical ventilation , mechanical <unk> and never built .
but if you &apos;re looking at it , you would see something like this very , very much .
this is from a hand , you know .
there are plans .
they know the problem that we don &apos;t believe what we know .
we don &apos;t want to know what we know .
second and julia romeo and julia , and <unk> , and <unk> , and diana , <unk> , that &apos;s love .
i spent now working now in the wheelchair seat , i &apos;ve got more about the lives of it as a outside of him .
we have our children as we associate our children , as millions species species live with us .
but it &apos;s not a regular movie .
if i &apos;m going to take a base of a base on every pixels with the resolution of <unk> x <unk> , we reclaimed , 3,000 screens , we need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need to need 3,000 screens , to take a look at the genomic .
what does this mean ?
and so he &apos;s the jewish of his children .
it &apos;s because there would be somebody who wants to eat the oil that wants to eat .
imagine , in 1977 , the foremost <unk> didn &apos;t retain your four years of excellence , <unk> , but also your personal brain .
and so i &apos;m asking you all the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and the genomic revolution that are around them .
and we have a <unk> , in a special <unk> , which is within the solid of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the hull of the pelvis .
hopefully , it &apos;s going to make this technology to see more of this .
on the branch , they &apos;re going to put the sample of the sample of the gas cells are going to see the accelerator and the chicago dies .
so , it &apos;s exciting . he can generate the early possible <unk> , so we &apos;re going to create a few new particles .
the most important is the electric charge .
they &apos;re going to tell us what changes .
but this is how much different theories .
many of it , it &apos;s the most beautiful structure of mathematics .
the only way to incentivize his health health , to get all the uncertainty , it &apos;s balance to the key services , and happiness in life , i &apos;ve got a lot of life .
the pattern of dots that i showed you , actually , actually , actually , actually , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , and on the <unk> space-time .
and we also heard about the story of the humanity of humanity , genetic modification .
in the <unk> , we find lots of examples examples of compassion , and to talk to the future .
most important , i think i &apos;m going to be able to work with small groups of women , to work on the verge of <unk> .
and you know , i mean , i &apos;m talking about the way i got from the
take the <unk> , for all the problems that we have the planet , and we have the planet , and in social media , it &apos;s a message of hope .
and a conscious of pregnancies and similar things , which is young people better than that .
this transformation , this transformation . change , the way we care about the future .
working with plastic , around plastic , around the first eight years , started to be used some of my own blocks and into national <unk> .
recycling , each one of the book , <unk> ecology with the idea of recycling .
so i &apos;m here , and we certainly have the audacity and we trial , the slope of the development .
the headquarters of the book is juan , our <unk> <unk> , our <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s going to be the final result of amazon .
at this time , we knew that that was a political thing .
i was a kid , a second , i was 16 .
i know what it means to be , and if a crime is a crime , should be a crime . &quot;
but what if they didn &apos;t think ?
after a few <unk> , i thought , but then this is the <unk> .
the guar . here .
okay . the lingua <unk> , of thousands of thousands of the world .
or we could use a sample of this .
so , they described as the european civil wars , and that &apos;s a <unk> description .
my opinion is my ladies and gentlemen , is that this is probably not due to the most basic <unk> that probably possible .
they &apos;re starting to see the <unk> world .
but this is not more .
the second nations from nations , now we always had .
but now , one last thing .
but if you ask the smartest thing questions , how the optimal formula for a long life for a long life , if he couldn &apos;t tell you .
it &apos;s remembered me , in my college time .
and the research shows that these years of free are free to <unk> , heart disease , heart disease , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer
they have what we want .
we are not going to half the half .
and for a while we looked at the <unk> budget in the <unk> , where there is actually a high proportion of <unk> .
instead , they &apos;re talking about the next trip in nature , the <unk> , the <unk> , etc .
it &apos;s us to reproduce them .
they tend to feed the <unk> .
for the little example i &apos;m here in the palm , we have a <unk> tablet , which is a <unk> <unk> , which is the skin is to orient this little light .
so often often , not experts , no experts , the creators of things , the creators of things like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
they were the big empty , just scientists , the only scientists , and no one just about it , and one of them to have a home .
you just begun to look at the eyes of the eyes to come out of the way .
i mean , i was seen it .
so we have the shapes that we have the driver <unk> .
and i said , i can &apos;t get it , but i can &apos;t get them into the zero-g , in my heart .
we had four com <unk> and two nurses in the airplane .
and actually , in fact , you can show some of the pictures , because i don &apos;t want to see on the screen .
no life is not a life to come up with no , would be able to be able to do without the little <unk> .
i &apos;m going to <unk> , i went to eat .
i had no idea of my i.q. was not decreased .
i was a writer .
so basically , no other family doesn &apos;t survive if you don &apos;t drink your kid .
and then we decided to use why not the religion of the religion , because it was the catholic church fairly strong , and <unk> .
we launched our first <unk> <unk> , and the women that organized <unk> , and the women that said , &quot; we want to learn about women .
you can &apos;t tell you the coca-cola , if you like this . it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
and then , aids enlightenment , tahrir in university , i started skiing in university .
and then , then , the american flag , &quot; don &apos;t even go home . &quot;
these are things that are being the from the business .
can you imagine , can you get a condoms ?
he may not be creepy or a really .
so i &apos;ll get a photograph .
you can simulate this behavior in the browser , what romo is doing here .
i want to tell you about four minutes of the <unk> .
people like all here in this room .
she went to mind , like a giraffe in the african savanna , the flag on their feet , i was skiing -- on the <unk> , the flag with the glorious , so my head under the <unk> .
i &apos;ve got my whole life with women and women .
jenny , jenny , clear that the only solution is the legal system teeth .
they bring the women to plant new trees and <unk> , drop for a drop of time .
women and children , especially the poor , stand down .
if you sold early on early , you you create the printing press , but if you wait too long , you &apos;re going to cut down the course .
you can recognize the spikes in the tops of light .
the challenge for the <unk> expressway is , &quot; if he thinks that something is fair or something that he thinks that he thinks it &apos;s too short , so he thinks that only one one &apos;s a two or two dollars .
now , i &apos;m going to show you a few of the strange .
we can try and maybe we &apos;ll be this .
so what do we learn today ?
about 10 calories , takes a kind of food that we consume in the west .
so , how did they do this city ?
and in the middle east , in <unk> , they &apos;re offered to offered to the heart , they &apos;re offered . this is why it &apos;s called <unk> .
and in the same changes changing our relationship completely to the food as the cities .
the word is thomas <unk> .
<unk> pile of
we need to understand that the world is what we eat .
it &apos;s the source of all the social of the social acts of the <unk> , and then , in another act of view of another .
and i see that this is a utilitarian intelligence , not just a <unk> sense .
in the current , we have been withdrawn , and we &apos;ve been withdrawn -- the one of a million bits , quite complex , new parts of steel , new technologies , concrete glass .
the next phase of artistic attempt to ask and the passive nature or the legal attempt to do <unk> .
essentially , you &apos;ve got a chain of elements .
when i was in <unk> , wisconsin , i was a public talk , i was a group of christian students students had students students students students had a group of christian students .
often , we &apos;re often searching for <unk> <unk> like a flu .
there &apos;s the unknown everywhere around us , and it just seemed to be discovered to become a surprise .
could we ask the light switch that we can ?
so we are chemical <unk> that are different , which is the way that our chemical species .
but i have to tell you -- and i &apos;m asking to say , richard -- i &apos;ve never liked about <unk> <unk> , and i think we all dating , we &apos;re going to have a group of a hundred million years .
everybody speaks to talk about a reduction to be an <unk> prize .
he realized that it &apos;s possible to make different laws that economies will enable the economy to provoke that the economy will enable the economy to win another customer .
both are critical to the comparison of <unk> , which means that many of the citizens have been missing .
this is what i heard about this <unk> next door .
people can come to life , but no one is forced to be .
lots of people have the idea of the <unk> understood that people can do .
how would we get a <unk> ?
you thought , in genomics , a little bit more than 10 years ago , that you had to have this tiny little tiny genomes between three genomes of it . it &apos;s hundreds of thousands of genomes .
if there &apos;s lots of variation , they packaged very much green light .
the rate of the cosmic gene is a bit of a bit of the goggles , but if we gave a <unk> , they &apos;ve got larger than the inner of genes in genes , to about a certain range of genes of genes .
it &apos;s a look after one of the patient , by the <unk> of the chromosomes in small chunks , within 12 hours of 12 hours within 12 hours of 12 hours within 12 hours of 12 hours within 12 hours of 12 hours within 12 hours of 12 hours within 12 hours of 12 hours within 12 hours of 12 hours in 12 hours .
let me talk to ethical and political research .
of course , the printer is that you &apos;re going to do .
we call them called &quot; <unk> &quot; . &quot; they focus on what will be going on .
and it &apos;s also about me . i grew as a poor child mortality in south bronx family , every lived in the past . every time in the past .
let &apos;s take the field .
this is a beautiful picture of the <unk> , the largest <unk> in the near of our milky way .
it &apos;s cold , cosmetics , <unk> , maybe it &apos;s raining , maybe it &apos;s raining and maybe they might register a <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
i can &apos;t tell you how this was the first pictures of mexican surface of what the most of of earth-like surface . this was what we saw .
so here we see a film , the dunes , which these dunes are 100 feet tall , which is 100 meters high , and then <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
now , as now , as now , as now we know that it &apos;s life in life .
they would have been 40 percent of their country and were so , they had no free access to the rest of the .
<unk> : this is a <unk> <unk>
so hannah is a demo .
it took only four days .
and like the rest of the brain &apos;s surface .
in the <unk> of the mirror , you find actually cells that are able to look at the hippocampus of <unk> in the hippocampus of the pacific ocean or the edges of the mouse or the mouse , if you &apos;re the environment .
and this would be <unk> by the fire .
he wasn &apos;t the only man who was in a america without <unk> , and he was not quite sure secure not the only thing that he was going to be the only thing .
and why should somebody really ?
people don &apos;t buy what they do , but why they do it .
the neocortex is responsible for all our rational and concepts .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so we audit them .
and if you talk about what they believe , they &apos;ll be the way they believe .
the reason for sure people are an iphone to the first six hours in the line , and you will have to get her to get to get her to the queue that everybody &apos;s going to see that everybody &apos;s . they were the first .
people buy what they do , they buy why , they buy why they do it , and what they &apos;re doing is just as a better for what they believe .
and , he &apos;s going to say , he was holding the dream of &quot; not &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; not &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; not &quot; i &apos;ve got a plan called &quot; <unk> .
i &apos;ll never forget , how cartoons in <unk> , hyper <unk> .
when this was made in the office in washington d.c. , the <unk> clinic , the <unk> clinic , the <unk> clinic , they were <unk> .
and we decided to take recipes , recipes .
what if we had a toy where we had a toy where you just not just to be the unless you &apos;re sick , but you &apos;re going to be healthy healthy .
and they &apos;re investing with the belief , the ability to the ability and the services , our most basic aspiration in public transportation .
i think that the end of health care , when we repair our health care , it &apos;s not the <unk> that cured , but the disease , it &apos;s going to be the disease that were going to be .
the <unk> represents a real world , and this is in the world , but this is in the indian ocean .
we have this <unk> toolbox , hoping that were six tons of cocaine , and six tons of cocaine .
eighty-five percent of you can &apos;t read if they &apos;re trapped in the afghan <unk> .
multiply the <unk> of these decisions with <unk> <unk> , as a safety of how can be entirely different from the world .
i really appreciate what i really .
remember , this is just a fun of me , when the <unk> were , when the <unk> were , when the <unk> were , you know , you &apos;re gazing for the dots for bush bush .
the circles represent the countries .
some countries had already been statistics .
but we need to make the united states , a whole bunch of time to find the same health care .
that changes themselves .
this looks like a happy story .
what you &apos;re going to make this : what you pay attention to what they are doing .
it &apos;s about being food .
it &apos;s this amazing concept of developing countries that are us , argentina and <unk> , argentina and <unk> , and claims , and it was that the ross is turned worse .
governance . a few government government -- the edges of the epa of the <unk> .
and i have the approach , as the seemingly impossible .
and the enemy is pretty weak .
we are -- despite with ease -- with ease in afghanistan .
&quot; it &apos;s not a ideal world . &quot; and that they also have no step closer . &quot;
how would you do this ?
what we need is , is a <unk> <unk> .
do you want to be a better system ?
and the doctor tells him , he &apos;s just not going to move .
&quot; who &apos;s called the most selfish world . &quot;
the body is rarely just rarely out of his heart , it &apos;s only rarely just rarely .
it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , strategic <unk>
thomas <unk> : a new way to peace
i don &apos;t want to be very hierarchical .
here you see the <unk> in the early stages of the early <unk> , who had a lot of the sulfur in the stratosphere , with a kind of a kind of partnerships in the stratosphere , with a kind of a kind of partnerships .
this report ended up on president <unk> , toronto , when i was two years old .
but let &apos;s say , you know , they have sunlight , that &apos;s on the particles and it &apos;s the way .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what happens . it &apos;s not very likely .
we have to continue under this scenario and further , and further from the current climate .
not just about how we do it better , what are the risks of the risk and side effects ?
here &apos;s a fish called the chicken , <unk> eyes .
and really incredible . there &apos;s two male .
and so i came to their <unk> , just two days ago .
if you look at the literature in east and west , they are incredibly different definitions of happiness .
in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , a state of fact , a state of fact , a state of fact , a state of fact , a state of the <unk> and care , the can help us .
we know that we can be able to be able to be able to be &quot; the little cathedral &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and be completely unhappy .
the mirror that allows you , but the mirror is not going to be able to obey , and not going to be a relatively significant .
if you ever do that , you &apos;ll do that your propensity , the wrath of anger , they &apos;ll get it up , because they &apos;re going to be the same thing .
of course , we do that with the training .
we are ready to be <unk> for our education .
it &apos;s really a <unk> for us .
it &apos;s a <unk> place . it &apos;s good .
you can see what happens is , at night three , bump to three of three .
not just just <unk> , just one cartoon of the sierra nevada .
this is actually a television , the <unk> is normal &quot;
we &apos;re going to do -- we have a <unk> , that bulgarians is a nordic language .
one last comment -- that &apos;s been doing for years , but i think it &apos;s important to be relevant for this audience .
and in this point we have about two days from the entrance .
this is <unk> <unk> falcon .
the ice can be between five and 25 miles deep deep .
the <unk> look at the same time , and the end , so that it can be new <unk> , whereas that it &apos;s still in the beginning of the eye , which has been done behind .
for the last two dollars , they would pay them a <unk> .
the says you &apos;re going to be a 10,000 feet , you want to get 10,000 feet faster than they want to come back to the screen .
and with the right support , this was going to be used in seven years .
i suppose you won &apos;t remember the conclusion that you won &apos;t get the question .
they also created a few company where the brand is not so good .
rb : no .
we have a video that shows what you &apos;re doing is , and virgin <unk> in the air .
he wanted to jump to her , or he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to be gone out of the way ?
okay , now that wasn &apos;t hard .
i mean , here are lots of people who have a lot of people who have kids and we have this dilemma , as we should .
rb : our <unk> would be that it actually would be the priests that it &apos;s called sex <unk> . &quot;
fifteen people showed our forms and they said , they would try it .
no , i want to live in all the way .
