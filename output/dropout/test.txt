you know , one of the big <unk> of traveling traveling and one of the joys of research in common with people who are still going on at the old days , which is still touching their past , they feel it out of the rain <unk> stones , they &apos;re eating them out of the bitter plywood .
just that , that <unk> is still beyond the milky way , or the meaning of myths of the oldest of the inuit , and are very hopeful , or that in the himalayas the buddhist , the buddhist , is the general , the the the world &apos;s greatest sense , which is the idea that the world that we &apos;re doing is not even a group of revelation .
and of course we &apos;re sharing all the same .
we &apos;re all born . we get children in the world .
we &apos;re going through .
we &apos;ve got to make us with the <unk> separation through death and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a <unk> in the forests of borneo , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warriors in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara .
all these people teach us that there &apos;s another different different ways , other thinking , other ways , other ways to the ground .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , you can get a difficulty hoping .
together , the myriad cultures in the world are forming a network of <unk> and <unk> life that &apos;s the earth and for the world &apos;s system as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
you can think of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and it can be the most concerned of all thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration , inspiration and hunches that were being defined by the human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re capable of as amazing as an amazing species .
and just like the biosphere became strong , this was happening with the <unk> -- only even more speed .
a biologist would say to say that 50 percent or more of all species are about extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true . and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> of the cultural diversity -- not what &apos;s been known as a <unk> <unk> on the area of cultural diversity .
and the crucial bellwether for this is extinct .
when each of them was born in this room , on earth 6,000 languages .
now language isn &apos;t just the total of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a tools that has a certain culture to find access to the material world .
every language is like a <unk> forest in mind , a inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem more spiritual possibility .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey here , we &apos;re not going to get more into your ears .
they won &apos;t teach infants anymore . that means if nothing has done , they already are already dead .
what could be lonely when silence was not to be one of the last people who speak language , no opportunity to have any opportunity to pass the wisdom of the ancestors or to get hope ?
and yet this terrible destiny is actually happening somewhere on earth , about two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly person die of an elderly and takes the last <unk> of an old language with the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be better place if we all talk about language ? &quot; and i say say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a child boy . let &apos;s say &quot; good , let &apos;s be a child boy .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then suddenly suddenly you would see how it would be if you could not talk your own language .
so i want to take you in a journey today on a journey through a journey , a short journey through the <unk> to try to understand them what actually had lost .
now there are some of us that are some of us who are in some sense that i &apos;m saying , &quot; miscellaneous ways of being , &quot; really different ways of mine .
for example , take this kid &apos;s child in the northwest northwest , the people of the <unk> , believe that they were <unk> the <unk> from the east in the stomach of sacred snakes .
this is a people who aren &apos;t cognitively cognitively between color blue and green , because the forest &apos;s forest is that people depend on , <unk> .
they have a strange language and a <unk> language called a linguistic rule : you need to marry somebody who talks to another language .
all of this opens in the historic past , and this strange of these big homes where they were talking about the <unk> six or seven languages , but that you never hear somebody who learns language .
they just listen and start talking .
or one of the fascinating tribes that i ever lived in the northeast of the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that first was asked in 1958 .
in 1957 , in 1957 , five <unk> were trying to touch five <unk> .
they were holding pictures of out of the air , which we would be as friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforests in their lives never seen something more thoroughly .
they were taking these photographs from the forest forest , tried to see behind the face or the character , nothing and <unk> that this was the action action of the devil , killed the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t just kill the fax .
they &apos;re going to take each other .
54 percent of deaths happened by <unk> .
we were tracking eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death and when we were doing a strong bit about it , they gave them that one of the people died so old that he died because of his age , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of forests that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps and determine what forms of this owned .
in the early years years , i got a really amazing job when my professor asked me whether i was interested in taking haiti and matched the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of the starches and <unk> <unk> , and make sure .
so to give a sense of this idea of a sense , i had to be something about this remarkable faith in the knowledge of knowledge and <unk> is not a cult of black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask them , you would recall the major world religion , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
a continent will be left out , because the guess was that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course there was a and <unk> , and of course , there was a little bit of this very profound religious thought that &apos;s the tragic diaspora in the <unk> .
but what makes the interesting thing that makes it interesting is this vibrant relationship between the living and the dead .
the living gave birth .
the spirits out of the big water , answers to the rhythm of the dance to try to find the soul of living around the world , so that the <unk> for a brief moment to god .
so , the <unk> likes to say , &quot; your white goes into church and talk about god .
we are dancing in the temples and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to get from your mind . how can you be done to harm ?
see these amazing demos : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal without combustion , an amazing visualization of the spirit of mind that this is that it &apos;s <unk> if it &apos;s actually <unk> into one state of extreme arousal .
now , from all people who i met , the <unk> from the sierra nevada nevada de santa &apos;s <unk> , the most remarkable .
offspring of the old <unk> civilization that &apos;s the caribbean in the caribbean in colombia and then in episode of the day , this people moved into a <unk> <unk> of a massive <unk> that &apos;s going on about the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones who never had conquered conquered .
until today &apos;s day , they &apos;re going to follow by a ritual priesthood , but training to priesthood is very remarkable .
the young ones are separated at age three and four years from their families and in a <unk> world of darkness , in a <unk> world of darkness , in the base of the ice , for 18 years , who would be elected for 9 months of the most <unk> , they spend a <unk> for 9 months of the great mother .
and throughout this time , they will have culturally aspiring into their society , values that they have to have their prayers and their prayers , their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that green -- balance .
at the end of this amazing thing , they &apos;ll suddenly taken out of one day , and for first time in her life , at age 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this very exciting moment of the first light , and the the <unk> starts to see what they &apos;ve learned in the abstract glory , and the preacher starts to be on the point of the beautiful light landscape , and the preacher starts to be told .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we &apos;re the younger brothers , we are in the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of native and landscape , we &apos;re not able to get <unk> and the old myth of the beautiful wild , which is a <unk> thought or thoreau and say , these people are connected more with nature than we .
so , native people are not <unk> , they &apos;re not going to be thrown away from the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have much place in the <unk> of <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have , through time and ritual , a skin shaped on earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware of their conscious , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth is not being able to be aware of their conscious .
now , what does this mean ?
it means that a little kid from the andes who believe that the mountain is a <unk> , who will be a <unk> or your destiny , will determine a different person , and another relationship with this resource or this place , a little bit of a little bit of rocks that can be worn away .
whether it &apos;s a kind of spirit of a spirit or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
and the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in woods in <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are going to be able to be <unk> .
so that made me another person when my friends were sitting in the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits that would be involved in their own <unk> minds .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different kinds of realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i just took last april in the northwest northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard , the most powerful amount of preparation from the civil performance .
what makes it fascinating is not just the most fundamental potential of this system , but it &apos;s actually made of two different sources , which is actually made of two different sources . on one side , there &apos;s this wooden <unk> , which is a set of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that are serotonin , <unk> and <unk> .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , like you put this stuff , this substance that they create from different ways also , including it .
this powder was to <unk> at this painting is about a <unk> shot at the <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a ocean of electricity .
it will not create bias whatsoever , it &apos;s not produced the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who gave the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the <unk> of the magic mushrooms , in mexico , i said that you couldn &apos;t be able to see this <unk> of behavior , because right now , you can &apos;t get this <unk> to be a <unk> .
but the thing with <unk> is that they cannot be obtained by the , because you &apos;re through one in the human gut , naturally called <unk> , called <unk> , <unk> .
they can only taken up with some other chemicals that is mao <unk> .
now , this fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> , are actually the kind of kind of thing that is necessary to get the <unk> , so questions about it .
how can these people from a biota of 80,000 species of plants that are not related to related plants that are combined , sort of combined , sort of a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , try and error what it turns out as meaningless .
but asked the indians say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does this mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , 17 different varieties of <unk> that they all recognize in the forest in the forest , which is a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of view .
and then you ask them how they justify their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take each of the 17 varieties of <unk> , and they take them to sing them in a different set of <unk> .
now , they don &apos;t get a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
now , the problem is that , the problem is that even those of us who have for the difficult situation of literacy , they have a <unk> and <unk> , but they &apos;re kind of just to the past , that means that means that our world is based on our world .
so , in fact , you know , the 20th century , in 300 years , not for his wars or technological innovation is actually going to remember , but rather than an era where we were present and inevitably accepted or passively based on earth , and so the problem isn &apos;t the change .
all cultures have involved in new research with new research research .
and the problem is not technology .
the <unk> didn &apos;t hear less to sioux when they bow and arrow tasks when americans stopped being americans when they were wearing horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . this is ugly face of rule .
and wherever you do in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures don &apos;t be the doom of the doom . these are dynamic living peoples , their existence by intermolecular forces , which is actually <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a <unk> of <unk> , which is a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a <unk> of <unk> , which is a <unk> of <unk> in the forest .
or if we go into the hills of tibet where i &apos;m going to spend a lot of research , you &apos;re going to see this ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction , not necessarily convicted of people , but the most destruction , the most of the life of people , not not not not not not not not not not necessarily , but celebrated as part of a collective school .
and you can &apos;t understand suffering with suffering , if you don &apos;t have seen it on the very specific level .
i &apos;ve been traveling with a young colleagues of <unk> from <unk> <unk> by lhasa , and only when i came up after lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear , 6,000 sacred monuments that were been transformed into the cultural revolution .
the father of this young was identified as followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant that he was killed in chinese invasion .
his uncle fled her humiliation with her holiness the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned as punishment for the crime .
he was smuggled in the age of two years in the prison to hide under her <unk> because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister who did this brave fact was brought into a <unk> .
one day she stepped out onto an spray , and for these <unk> , she had to work for seven years into a heavy camp .
and the suffering is unbearable , but the most profound spirit of people is something .
and at the end , we really stand a choice , we want to do a <unk> world of <unk> or in a technological world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the big anthropologist said that it died that it was her greatest fear that while we move towards a thread , <unk> , meaning worldview worldview worldview that we would have gone from a dream of thinking , but we &apos;ve never just thought that there was another one day .
and it &apos;s deeply thinking that our species has been there for 600,000 years .
the most common revolution that brought us agriculture , and we &apos;ve got us in this moment of <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> of the priesthood , <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- found only 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
now , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are facing in the ensuing millennia .
if we &apos;re these myriad of questions about how human questions , you agree with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song we will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a way of being aware of the importance of consciousness that matters that all people and gardens are thriving , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the north end of the <unk> when i went to the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government isn &apos;t always very good with the inuit and during the years of the years of the state of our domination , they were forced to move in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandmother refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took all the guns and all the tools .
now you know that the inuit have no fear of the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their sled was originally from fish that was produced in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather wasn &apos;t frightened before the arctic night or the white storm .
he was out out out , his pants off from <unk> down and <unk> his hand , and when the feces began to cold , he shaped them into the form of a <unk> .
he was eating saliva on the sides of the body and when it was completely frozen , he &apos;s got a dog .
he was throwing the dog and dressed into a dishes , took a skeleton of the dog &apos;s dog and alley , <unk> a another dog , and <unk> on the <unk> table with the passenger carcass .
you can &apos;t do anything .
and this is a symbol of a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and all the peoples in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april in 1999 , in 1999 , complete control over an area , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country &apos;s country and called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look at it and achieve it .
and then finally , i think it &apos;s fairly obvious , at least for those of us that are to these distant goals of earth , to realize that they &apos;re not not away from all .
they are the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are in past time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children are going to do the dreams of our own children &apos;s values .
what we ultimately try to do at national geographic is that we think politicians never get anything .
we think that <unk> -- we think that &apos;s not acceptable , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling , our website receives 35 million dollars every month .
156 nations send our transportation .
our magazines are read from millions .
and we &apos;re doing a series of travel into the <unk> , which we have to take our audiences in places like such cultural wonder that you &apos;re blinded by the world &apos;s central well-being , and hopefully you will think one of the world &apos;s core of innovation .
thank you .
what i first is going to show you as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve got microsoft as part of a year ago , just a year , and it &apos;s a environment where you can use huge or away with enormous amounts of visual data .
we see many , lots of gigabytes of digital photographs here that you &apos;re woven and constantly <unk> , functional , in any way .
and it &apos;s no matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big these pictures are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in a field of 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that can be able to be able to be able to do this is a number of pixels on your screen in each moment . it has also a very flexible architecture .
this is a book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not about a picture , we can really show something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the quantum performance and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a shoe .
and they really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several scales .
we also did something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed an false display with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we added some additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this cars , you can see here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and these sets of ideas on the position of space on the screen .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t mean any <unk> and other nonsense -- that should not need to be necessary .
of course , this is mapping one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here except to say that we &apos;re going to be able to do this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
<unk> on top of nasa &apos;s most violent picture .
let &apos;s get some other out .
now , this is even live on the internet . you can do it .
this is a project with the names that actually combines two different technologies together .
one is <unk> and the other is a very good research about <unk> , who was a <unk> university department at university , at the founding of steve <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> .
and rick <unk> from microsoft research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see this if we create this kind of view of view where we can penetrate through pictures and make this experience of the most fundamental resolution .
but the spatial orientation of pictures is actually what matters .
the <unk> gave these pictures together by the actual space that they &apos;re all around near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> , similar to these things , these things are all in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know if i still have time to show you different environments .
there are what much more nuanced .
i &apos;d like to show right one of the most promising set sets of noah to show you , and this is from a early prototype of the early prototype that we first worked in summer to show you what i think that really is the punchline behind this technology , which is the <unk> .
we had to make us care because of the lawyers .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral notre dame who had just achieved entirely on the computer with photographs , and they &apos;ll just meet pictures of men in flickr and they &apos;ll be on the <unk> of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> .
so this is all the <unk> , and they &apos;re all in perspective in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in these very simple ways .
you know , i never thought i will work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very appreciative for the reception show .
i guess you can see that there are lots of different kinds of cameras : everything is to professional engineering , a fairly large number of them that were all been in in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird .
many of them are covered by faces .
somewhere here there are a bunch of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a posters of notre dame that was actually recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and there &apos;s data data from all -- from all the collective memory of how how visual the earth looks like -- and everything is connected together .
all these photographs are connected together and then emerges something that is bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that emerges from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of working on virtual earth .
and this is something that is through complexity that people use it , grows and use its use for the users over using application .
their own photographs are brought with metadata , which has another person took .
if somebody did the trouble and all these sacred identified and tell you who they &apos;re all , then my photograph of notre ghraib , suddenly , i can use them as a place to do this , and i can use them as a tool to do this , and use some kind of <unk> <unk> of social experience .
and of course , that byproduct of all of these are exquisitely undermining virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that not only were supported by <unk> or satellite satellite data and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
and i understand them right ? your software allows you to do that at some point , within the next years , all of pictures that are used by somebody in the world in common principle ?
yeah . she doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want to make them out between the pictures .
and she does this because of the content in the pictures .
and this is really exciting when you think about the amount of information information that many of these pictures have .
how if you do a <unk> for pictures where you can make sentences and the text of the website contains lots of information about what &apos;s painting .
but how would it be if you &apos;re doing all your pictures ?
then the scope of the <unk> <unk> and the abundance that makes it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , this is really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , as i hope , in harmony with other things you &apos;ve heard already . and i &apos;m going to try to make myself some connections if you haven &apos;t noticed .
i want to start with what i call &quot; formal <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western societies .
and the official arm works is like this : if our goal is maximizing our citizens , is about the most about the freedom of the individual .
and the reason this is that freedom is good , valuable , meaningful , a basic premise for human .
if people have freedom , each of us is about themselves to do things that maximize our good good for us , and nobody has to decide for us .
it &apos;s freedom to maximize freedom to maximize .
the more choices are , the more freedom they have . and the more freedom they have , the more good public have .
this is , i think , deep in our water supply , that no sense of no matter that it would be .
and it &apos;s also rooted deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say about a little bit about <unk> .
there are 175 of 175 points in my supermarket if they don &apos;t get 10 different extra <unk> , and 12 of them who could buy a huge amount of their psychotherapy , in unlikely case , no fact no 175 of the 175 of 175 of the 175 of the red in the store .
so this is like the supermarket .
and then they go to the <unk> business for a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , radio , radio , radio , sports , amplifier . and in this one electronics there &apos;s so many <unk> facilities .
we can put up million different kinds of facilities together from the components that are offered in this business .
you must admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was a kid who could have had to have any telephone , as long as he came from yellow bell .
they rented your telephone . they didn &apos;t get bought it .
a consequence of that was that the telephone never broke .
these days are over .
we now almost have an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phone &apos;s mobile phone .
my favorite is the middle of the center -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this in your business , you can be secure that they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it makes people running and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is about ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which are much more than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
health -- it &apos;s no longer longer in the united states that you go to doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to doctor and doctor said to you : we could do a or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do they want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks .
what do they want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy &quot; . it sounds like a good thing , but reality is a shift burden of the responsibility of someone who knows something about -- <unk> of the patient &apos;s disease -- <unk> the patient &apos;s disease -- <unk> the patient &apos;s disease .
there &apos;s enormous marketing for people like them and me , if you think about it , if you think about it , even no sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why they advertise us to us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is : you expect us to call us the next morning and request a change in the prescription .
something like this is as much as our identity is now a question of choice to show you this slide .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re reinventing how we want to do .
that means that every day you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person wants to be .
so , for marriage and family , there was a time where the <unk> was that almost everybody had had one and they could quickly get them as quickly as they could , and then they got as quickly as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who &quot; couldn &apos;t when they did .
now today , all right now .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work when i did .
and not because they are less smart , not because they &apos;re very carefully .
it &apos;s because they are busy things , they ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i have children , or just career career ? &quot;
they are all the questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether that means all the tasks i &apos;m going to do and not get good note in my class .
and indeed , they should do this . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed as carl described , technology that allows us every minute of every single time on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , i &apos;m going to tell no tell you that the <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we &apos;ve got to make decisions about work , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our children playing football , and we have our mobile phone to a hip , and our blackberry , and our laptop of other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if they &apos;re all removed , every minute where we &apos;re a <unk> of a <unk> , we &apos;re asking ourselves , &quot; should i suppose this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be a very different experience of your child &apos;s experience .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world where we lived like this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world where we &apos;re seeing life that &apos;s happening .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what good about this , so i &apos;m going to do what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on humans .
an effect , more inclusive , is that it &apos;s <unk> it &apos;s <unk> .
you can vote with so many options that you can vote , it &apos;s really hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
one of me had access to me from <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was 10 year-old <unk> , the employers took up by two percent .
they provide 50 percent dollars -- 10 percent less employees , take them less than if they would have five . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> , which are selecting to choice , is so hard to decide to choose that you put it in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow morning , and tomorrow tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , i never come .
you understand that that &apos;s not only means that people should eat food if they &apos;re not enough money to go , because they don &apos;t have enough money to make decisions that they &apos;re missing a lot of their employers .
they &apos;re not enough to give you to 5,000 dollars a year on the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes it that the world looks like this .
they want to make decisions really right when it &apos;s for all ages , right ?
they don &apos;t want to vote in the false investment fund , or the false <unk> .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we get over paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of choices as if we had had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is taking through the big selection of different ways , if you buy one , and it isn &apos;t perfect -- and that &apos;s what <unk> is perfect ? it &apos;s just a reminder that you could have a different decision that would have been better , and what happens is that they have a good decision .
the more opportunities there are , the more is not regret all that is disappointing for choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert did a big point today by how much the kind of we assign things about what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s lots of alternative to consider it is just attractive traits of alternatives that you do , that makes you less happy with the alternatives they &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for you who don &apos;t care new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
here &apos;s some of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you &apos;ve got it all for himself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my girlfriends &apos;s neighborhood .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he has missed the possibility , day day , a great parking lot .
<unk> reduce happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we &apos;ve chosen to have fantastic .
and even more opportunities there are choices , the more attractive attributes of these choices are addressed into account .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon is some statements .
he makes a testimony about this now and perhaps things do things slowly .
but one more important point that he does is : whoever you choose for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive qualities , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less individually .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this was struck me when i wanted to share my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was just jeans of some kind of time , and they bought them , and they were very bad , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they had gotten them long enough , they &apos;ve got it , &quot; ok .
so he went to buy new jeans after many years of the old age , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like a few jeans here , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sales said , &quot; want you to do , easily <unk> or large ?
want you want buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
want you to do jeans with holes ?
they want to cut down far far , blah blah blah blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , &quot; i loved the way that was used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what was , so i spent an hour all of this damn jeans , and dungeon that business -- and i say the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain myself .
and the reason that i felt bad with all of these options , my expectations for what good for a good few jeans was going up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when they were just in some kind of one way .
when they came into 100 ways , doomed , one of them should have perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had was to get what i expected , and what i had was disappointing compared to what i expected .
and then add ways to ensure that people are increasing in the lives of people , people have informed about how good these possibilities are going to be .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even if the results are good .
no one in the world of the <unk> knows that , because if you would know , they don &apos;t know what it would do .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that used to better than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was for people to make experiences of experiences that was a pleasant surprise .
now today , in the world where we live -- we live wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection -- the best for you ever hope to hope is that you expect to be as good as you expect them .
they will never make comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all came -- the secret to the risk of hiv is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short bit of a moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really very wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do better . i didn &apos;t get any <unk> .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a bad ending of a bad sitting , if there &apos;s only one kind of purchase to buy a way that if you are dissatisfied , and they ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is right . what would you have ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one of the disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
so it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : you .
they could have better do better .
with 100 different types of jeans in the field of light , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so if people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re assured themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> of the explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned that were gone to be the disappointing , because their standards are so high .
and so this is what we &apos;re doing is that it &apos;s more often about that , objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remember you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choices better than a choice .
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time to improve our good good .
now , as an explanation , i &apos;m almost done -- as an explanation , the thing about thinking about thinking about it . what these choices allows all of these choices in the industrialized societies , is material wealth .
there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of you , their problem isn &apos;t the big choice .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i talk about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and angry , steve <unk> has told you about how these more expensive and hard to not help in a <unk> car car . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it isn &apos;t easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re worried about that we stand bad there .
if something of what makes our society makes as decisions as making decisions in which people would have understood too few choices would not only improve life of people , but our dignity would be enhanced .
economists call this an application application .
so , <unk> is worried that it &apos;s going to be better -- not only poor -- because all these big choices are going to do .
finally , read this cartoon , and you can say this cartoon , and say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this room . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a mechanistic view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i &apos;ve read it first .
and ever i thought about thinking about it , the more i came to the point that fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so it &apos;s possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if they break the <unk> , so it &apos;s possible , they lower happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost a limited security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of this is a recipe for a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for misery , and i guess , catastrophe .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about human genome and what could mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
actually , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by building new life .
we always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to these minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> , the change from the analogous world of biology to digital world &apos;s digital world .
now we try to ask whether we can regenerate or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate themselves in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried whether we can do this with another smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to get a hundred genes from the 500 or like that .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , as you trust me , that &apos;s easy . but if we &apos;re all looking at these genes that we can see one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to reflect this chromosome , which allows us to change the individual components and make some of this fundamental questions .
and so we started asking , we can synthesize a chromosome ?
does it enable the chemistry to make these really big molecules , what did never been done before ?
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
another chromosome is just a piece of liquid chemical material .
our steps in the collaborative of life were exponentially .
our ability to write in the ability to write very slowly but increasing , and we &apos;ve got this final point now on an exponential curve .
we &apos;ve started about 15 years ago .
it actually took some years from a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out , it turns out very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a finite process , so you have a piece of power that will happen more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method with which we put these little bits and correct those kinds of mistakes .
this was our first trial , starting with digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
we made little bits , made a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
and the exciting phase came along when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and gave into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were released by the cells and then came back and killed e. coli .
recently i talked about oil oil , and they said that they were going to understand this model .
they laughed more than you .
so we think that this is a situation in software actually actually building your hardware hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go far further . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome : it has more than <unk> letters letters , so we thought we &apos;re building it into filled with the size of the virus to understand what the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to launch with digital information in the computer , digital information is really to be accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the <unk> of a mere mere mere pair of pairs per 10,000 .
we found 30 mistakes in the <unk> , if we had had been used the original sequence , never could have been possible .
one part of design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long and they have to overlap with other pieces of forms to make smaller <unk> , so they fit .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built into the <unk> .
think about this : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t and t.
so , this letters is called about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single sense for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially we &apos;ve signed it .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve created the pieces so we simply engineered them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that can pull these together and together again .
and we &apos;ve started making pieces , starting with pieces of these five to <unk> letters , added these together to make these together together to make these together together , putting these together again .
so in each step we &apos;ve produced these bits in the surplus so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of the <unk> .
so this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 pairs pairs -- they &apos;re not going to grow in e. coli , it exceeds all the possibilities of modern biology . and so we did we put other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the <unk> <unk> , which is using biology to repair dna that can bring together these bits together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> three million rads of radiation .
you see the upper field that his chromosome is simply falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything came together again .
we &apos;ve got thousands of organisms that can do .
these organisms can be completely dried , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely secure living in space and move , looking for <unk> conditions .
actually , nasa has shown there &apos;s lots of them out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we made that we &apos;ve made these processes -- actually we &apos;ve used only <unk> with the right design of the bits , we &apos;ve got them out , yeast fills these together .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the <unk> .
this is footage over a span of six seconds .
this is the publication we &apos;ve got recently done recently .
this is about <unk> letters in the code , it &apos;s the largest molecule with automated structure that ever has ever created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a 10 and without a second , it would be more inclusive sides , just to be able to do this genetic code .
now , how do we launch a chromosome ? how do we put it ?
clearly , it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s very easy to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also as easy as you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re just taking the nucleus and put another inside , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about explained about explained .
and in fact , the chromosome is encoded in the cell , but we &apos;ve just shown recently that you can do a complete transplant chromosome from one cell to another chromosome .
we put the chromosome of a <unk> . in fact , these two are from another from another like humans and mice , we gave some <unk> to the chromosome , we could use this chromosome , and we &apos;re actually very amazing as we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing as we &apos;re making our very instinctive graphic .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process to something .
this is the darwinian evolution of evolution .
we find all sorts of species here here , or a third chromosome , every time thousands of characteristics in just one second one second .
so people who have evolution as a gene that has missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the enzymes called the <unk> , which actually digest dna .
the chromosome that has no one has no ; the chromosome we &apos;ve got there .
it was <unk> in the cell and realized that another chromosome as foreign material , and so we had just just one cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s found blue blue because of genes we put in .
and after a very short time , there was all the characteristics of species and completely found out in a new species based on new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;re walking .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can change the basic change , change things quite dramatic .
now i said that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve told that we may be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new diagnostic applications based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s fairly obvious in terms of what we need .
we are from six billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context : i was born in 1946 in 1946 .
today today three people are on this planet for everybody in 1946 in 1946 , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have trouble with food , fresh water and clean water , medicine , fuel fuel for six billion people .
it will be a challenge for 9 .
we need five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . this is hundreds of millions of strands of strands on day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all co2 from this material to land that material .
we &apos;ve got out of our discoveries from all around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most fundamental ones of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and see it &apos;s a variety of it .
we &apos;re just injecting the limits of biological reality and that &apos;s our idea .
we have technologies today because of this rapid engineering plan to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we &apos;ve now able to build a big robot to build the millions of chromosome on day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes or these processes to create <unk> , or drugs new vaccines , we can change with a small team more biology biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s only finite selection . we can use <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> and so on .
this is a photograph of actual <unk> of what we &apos;re working with is actually sit down and design new species at the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it will look like . we know exactly what your genetic code will look like .
we now focus on the rising generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn ethanol , which is simply a bad experiment .
we have fuels the oil sector and third generation that are going to get much higher , much higher , as a <unk> or different species of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way that biology is a huge impact without any more augmentation of food or the limitation of its capacities , if we see co2 as its structure , and therefore we work on cells that go out that path .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with the first generation of the fourth generation , and this in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the sea , about <unk> miles deep , almost more <unk> .
it converted co2 down in methane around the use of hydrogen as source source .
we &apos;re studying co2 co2 , which could simply be brought into <unk> , co2 cells , co2 cells to power this process .
within a short period of time we believe we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really -- <unk> goals like the substitute of all the industry industry , right . if you couldn &apos;t do this at ted , where otherwise ? a total of energy .
but we &apos;re working on this right now to use the same approaches for developing vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year , and you have a dollar too little when it goes around the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s change by developing vaccines in the <unk> .
this is what the future might look like to look like with changes , can be accelerated by synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we are from light light from making people better , our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to survive that might possibly be . thank you very much .
i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who were not there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment which ever addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create conditions that were less than a very early basis of the universe -- and this is about 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> into detectors .
i work on this . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 feet in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas , so you see the scale of the scale .
at 10 last year , the machine was going to first time .
and this image was recorded by atlas .
it caused huge <unk> in the chinese control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> which all the track around the lhc , then deliberately to be able to make a part of the lhc to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this painting on 10 september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know whether this was going to be the largest <unk> , or this when somebody visited the google page and was the front page .
it means that we reached an cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with this machine which was wired to do with this rock -- these golden wires here .
these wires are <unk> <unk> when the machine runs on <unk> .
now , the engineers among you are looking at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t do . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very far down , they &apos;re going to call them out .
so at minus degrees degrees , colder than the space between the stars can withstand these wires .
in one of the connections , between colorful magnets in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
so they heat wires down and <unk> <unk> and just a sudden <unk> resistance .
this was the outcome .
now , this is pretty wonderful as you imagine that magnets weigh over 20 tons and extends about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets damaged .
and they had to remove what we did .
we put them new , they &apos;re <unk> them .
they are all over your path again .
against march march , the lhc will be again again .
we &apos;ll turn it on , and expect to collect first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to collect our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe .
now , of course , on a kind of spark accidents , these accidents are about science and <unk> on such borders , it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so heavy , the fact that we reach beyond our limits , creating value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who i guess when he was the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his apprentice was so dangerous for the development of the human mind , and his was a nature of the human mind , and was that we have no mystery for the evolution of the human mind . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m writer writer .
books to write is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s my big , lifelong love and fascinated .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
however , recent things is curious about my life and my career that has brought me to my relationship to this work completely .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- that decided otherwise different than all my previous books went out in the world and a big <unk> , international <unk> .
and the result is that i &apos;m going to know where i come , i will be treated as if i was going to be the doom .
seriously , seriously , the fall !
for example , they come all along to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you feel that you will never be blown this success ?
don &apos;t you feel afraid that they were all going to be all her life and never again a book that interests anyone in the world ? never again ?
okay , this really makes guts .
but it would be worse if i couldn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i was a teenager told for the first time i wanted to be writer with the same kind of <unk> response .
people said : <unk> did you not fear never have succeeded ?
did you feel that you kill the humiliation of an insurance ?
didn &apos;t fear that you have this craft to make your life and you get to get on a <unk> dream of dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of the failure ?
something like , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;m afraid to fear more things that no one would be a result .
like algae -- and other things .
but if it &apos;s about writing about writing , i &apos;ve recently got about it and ask me : why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logically that someone should expect someone to do that he &apos;s afraid to do the work ?
and what is what &apos;s about doing with creative business , that they make us comfortable about the specific quality of mental quality -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my dad , for example , was chemists and i couldn &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as chemists , where he was told whether he was afraid to be chemists .
with your favorite , john -- how do you go ?
it just didn &apos;t come up , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists haven &apos;t gotten the reputation of <unk> people .
we seem writers but not just the writers , but not just the writers , but the creative of all the <unk> , seem to be emotionally immensely unstable .
everything you need to do is to watch bitter <unk> from really great minds from the 20th century , who died young and often died of their own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually committed to the <unk> of their talent seemed really neglected .
norman <unk> said about his death : <unk> every my books has killed me a little bit .
an extraordinary testimony that they can do about your life &apos;s life .
but we don &apos;t even lose if we hear somebody like this because we &apos;ve been aware of this kind of statements for such as long time , somehow we &apos;ve been aware of the attitude that includes and all the way that art -- and that art -- that &apos;s the end of the -- always the end of the end of the .
the question i want to ask every one here today is : is this idea for you all right ?
do you feel about it ? because with only one centimeter apart -- i feel like this attitude not probably .
i find them constantly .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch it &apos;s taken back into the next century .
i think better if we &apos;re going to make our creative creative policy .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start , this dark path of concept , sort of <unk> -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
this means -- look , i &apos;m quite young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 more science research in mine .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now about the world as the work is going to be a result of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s because we &apos;re all right here , all of your friends -- it &apos;s probably probably that my greatest success is behind me .
oh jesus jesus , what &apos;s for a thought !
this is the kind of thought that can bring someone to get 9 a.m. at 9 a.m. , drinking ginger . and i don &apos;t want to .
i would better keep doing this work i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the <unk> , i seems to tell me that i could continue to write a kind of most primitive psychological construction .
i somehow have to find a way of thinking about a way of making a secure distance to true between me and my very natural attention about how the reaction is going to be on writing .
while i &apos;ve looked for models for models for this , i &apos;ve looked at the past , and i tried to find other societies to see whether they might have better or more comfortable ideas about how you have creative skills to do with the emotional risks .
this quest led me to old greece and old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece and rome didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they thought that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was from a distant , unknown source source to people -- from <unk> , unknown , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine <unk> of creativity , <unk> demons .
from socrates known that he believed he would have a <unk> that was delivered to him from afar .
the roman idea had this kind of idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit called a <unk> genius .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really thought that a genius was a special smart individual .
they thought that a genius was this kind of magical creature that was believed that it was literally living in the walls of a <unk> -- about like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist in work in work in a kind of invisible .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s it , there &apos;s the distance i talked about -- amy what i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of the artist was made in front of certain things , like , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at anything for you . everybody knew that you had this kind of gnarly genius that helped you .
if your work is not your fault -- not entirely your error , or ?
everybody knew your genius was paralyzed .
so people in the west have really long time about creativity .
and then the renaissance came along and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s ask us the human individual in the center of the universe -- all gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no longer for mystical creatures that give orders of divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational humanism and people started thinking that creativity completely came from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you know people who or these artists call a genius -- instead of making a genius .
i need to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a naked person would think that he thinks or it &apos;s like the vessel vessel like the basin and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , infinite <unk> , a little bit too much better to make them a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a human psychology .
it &apos;s like somebody to try to swallow the sun .
the myth and distorted whole ego , and it creates all these kinds of attention to success .
i think this libertarian &apos;s our artists destroyed our artists in the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe a ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just have a <unk> in the 500 years of not just <unk> in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that really really <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , people who are <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to talk about is : why not ?
why not thinking about it ?
because it makes as much sense of everything else i heard about when it was about that was going to explain perfectly crazy to the creative process .
a process that goes -- like everybody knows that has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here is not always true .
indeed , he can feel really really confused .
i had a encounter that i had a encounter with the extraordinary american poet stone stone , who was now about 90 , but she told me that she was working up in the <unk> virginia , she told me that she was working up in the <unk> virginia . she said she was working on the fields .
she said it was like a <unk> train from air .
it would be a <unk> on the country .
she felt if it came because it would bring the earth underneath your feet .
she knew that she could only do one moment in a moment , and this was -- in your words -- <unk> race like the devil .
she ran like the devil sitting in her house during her poem , and it was not that they quickly had enough enough to get enough to a sheet of paper and a pencil , so you could capture it when it could capture them through them , capture and capture on the sheet .
and they couldn &apos;t paint until you couldn &apos;t get a long enough , she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and gave me her poem by her and she said it would be a <unk> for a different poet .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m never forget about -- she said that there were moments in which she was almost missed it .
so she runs home and search after the paper and the poem drive through her and she grabs a pencil as it was doing it through it and then -- she said -- was it like this one of the other hand would reach out and get it .
she caught his tail on his tail and moved it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and in these opportunities , the poem was completely and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from last word for first .
when i heard this , i thought that &apos;s amazing -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is happening .
this is not like my creative process -- i don &apos;t get the canal !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work on the same time , i &apos;m getting up at the same time and sweat , and really uncomfortable with me .
but even i i &apos;ve got this thing in my school , sometimes this thing .
and i guess many of you have done this .
even i had work or ideas that made from a source of me , which i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what is this for one thing ?
and how do we get to lose our minds without losing our minds , but even we &apos;re going to keep us in the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this , tom &apos;s musician , i was given him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this subject . and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of modern modern artist who tried , these <unk> creative pulses who lived in him .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going on a grassland grassland in los angeles , and there all changed for him .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody that is often a lot of it , it &apos;s difficult to make it excruciatingly difficult , and he wants it . it &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s not able to do it .
he has no paper , he has no pencil , he has no <unk> .
so it starts , this old <unk> hall goes up in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be haunted by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of getting panicked , he just stopped .
he ended all the thoughts and did something completely new .
he just looked in heaven and said , <unk> sorry , can you not see that i drive car ?
so i &apos;m like i just made a song like i just write a song ?
if you really want to get up to a moment , come back to a moment , if i can care about you .
if not , somebody else today .
go and <unk> cohen cohen .
his whole research system has changed after that .
not the work . it was still as dark as usual and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> surrounding him , was gavage when he took up genius , where he was doing nothing as anger and then he was going to come from where he was going to be a <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , weird , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , continuously thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a bit of the way i worked and i &apos;ve been saved me once .
this idea was saved me when i was in the middle of the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , i fell in one of these kinds of things that we all fall when we &apos;re going to work on something , and you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not only bad , but worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be the project .
but then i remembered how tom had talked to the free heaven and i tried to .
so i raised my view from the manuscript and i talked about my commentary towards a empty corner of the room .
i talked loud : <unk> shut , you know , you and i know both , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it isn &apos;t completely my blame , right ?
because you see that i &apos;ve got everything i &apos;ve got , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to show up your stake on this deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m going to write on , because this is my job .
and i want to ask questions to roll that i was here today for my part of the job .
because ... at the end is like follows , and centuries ago , in the deserts of <unk> people have gathered together with sacred dance and music , who were hours of stopped -- until dawn .
these strong were always great because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , it was very rarely , something happened happening , one of the actors was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all have seen some of these performance .
it was like the time of <unk> and the dancer , they did not even do anything else than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but all i added together .
and suddenly he didn &apos;t quite seem to be more human .
it was lit from inside the inside and lit off underneath underneath , and all the <unk> through a <unk> fire .
so when something happened , people knew what was . she called it on his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical research : when the <unk> <unk> came to moved to this field , who pronunciation changed throughout the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
if a performer has done something disgusting , something magic has done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , bravo , bravo , bravo , well , a forgotten look at god .
and this is great because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , if the dancer wakes up , and recognizes that 11 o &apos;clock in tuesday is 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he no longer contributes to a god of god .
he &apos;s merely a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knee , and maybe he will never get up to these heights .
and maybe maybe someone &apos;s name &apos;s name is not going to call your name , but what should he start with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most profound themes of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be fully fully as full of <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of them came from them .
if you may just believe that you are a loan -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> time of your life that will passed on someone else if they &apos;re done .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think about security in the last months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s soon coming on -- when it &apos;s dangerous , frightening , strong longing for my success .
what i &apos;m going to say about myself , if i &apos;m crazy about it , i don &apos;t fear .
not <unk> .
just make your job .
stay on your contribution wherever he &apos;s .
if your job is dance , dance .
if the dumb divine genius that &apos;s asked you to be deciding for a brief moment of miracles through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if not , dance still dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you .
i believe it and i feel like we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for you to say that you just love human love and the <unk> of it .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic sea , that had been less three million years that had size of the lower 48 states for 40 percent shrunk .
but this doesn &apos;t press enough enough to make this awful enough problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of ice .
in a sense , the arctic heart is the beating heart of our global health .
it grows in the winter and declining in summer .
the next slide i show you is a <unk> thing that happened for the last 25 years .
the <unk> is labeled red .
as you see , it grows up on the <unk> , this is annual ice in winter ; and it &apos;s declining in summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old , and older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body .
it &apos;s going to be gone from here in 25 years .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason to be on ocean ocean ocean , where there &apos;s vast amounts of carbon dioxide in which we &apos;re going to have <unk> , from microbes to methane .
comparing the entire amount of battery in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this critical period .
now today , solar cells today in some planets today , in alaska , in alaska , from itself from water .
professor <unk> 2004 : 2004 , 2004 , 2004 , with another group on another flat ocean , traveled to another flat ocean .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will it be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat from north greenland .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are far bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know , like sea level , it &apos;s going to put it into sea .
these rivers are taking worse .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest oxygen epidemic on the planet .
last month researchers decided that all the continent has been a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that came across a few of the <unk> , is especially much in the melt .
this is 20 feet , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see up new lakes , which were happening a few years ago .
forty percent of all people in the world are getting half their <unk> from this .
in the andes , this glaciers is the water in the world .
the <unk> has expanded .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s going to be the most water .
in california , an 40 percent reduction in the sierra percent deflation of the sierra hemisphere .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions , as they &apos;ve read them are seriously .
these post-it books around the world leads to a dramatic augmentation in fire .
and the catastrophes around the world have actually been increasing in a really <unk> and unprecedented degree .
four times many times as many years in the <unk> <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it &apos;s going to do .
we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 in co2 every day -- 25 million tons every day in the ocean .
look at the realm of the eastern pacific pacific precisely , from american continent west and <unk> of indian <unk> where there &apos;s a radically decline in the ocean .
the largest factor for global warming , between forestry , which is 20 percent , is burning from fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> groups combined with china .
and then then the proposal was to build many more <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were eliminate the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
so , there &apos;s a political dispute in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> has spent a $ <unk> dollars last <unk> to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction .
this picture reminded me .
around christmas morning , at home in school , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you &apos;ve seen it in news .
this is in our entire country of the <unk> america .
this was happening at christmas .
one of the advertisement of the <unk> around christmas .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , happy boy .
it &apos;s in black and abundance in america , and it helps our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will be cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers remain living and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the director of <unk> .
let me say clearly , al gore , nancy gore , named harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate change was called two campaigns .
this is one , part of you .
and we see climate change as a serious risk for our business .
so we set up the supreme court for the supreme court , to bring a <unk> to the way to get the truth about coal .
fact , coal isn &apos;t dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also good good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate .
let &apos;s leave that quietly .
virgin coal , you &apos;ve heard lots of them .
so let &apos;s take us a tour of this modern , green <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of green <unk> .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean amount of things that you see here , changes everything .
look at it right , this is today , clean solar data .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , economics , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that combines these together is our dependence on oil spills like dirty coal and oil spills .
but now there &apos;s a brave , new solution to free us from this very difficult place .
<unk> america , 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , and help us to stop global warming .
finally , one solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence upon old , dirty fuels that are communicating our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment to create good paid jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african african saying : &quot; if you want to be quickly , walk alone .
if you want to come far far , go together . &quot;
we need to get far , and quickly .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you to take your childhood on your childhood when they were playing with <unk> .
while they realized how you turn out your hands and pull out the <unk> , and move , they were actually learning to think and thinking and change the climate change .
and the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my favorite <unk> and my colleagues , i started to wonder : what would be if we could use computers , which would be like a digital <unk> set on a flat <unk> , and i started to be able to do it with a <unk> , which would be like we want to do ?
this question was so moving that we decided to explore the answer and decided to do the answer .
soon , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can capture your motions and you have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly : are physically , so you can only move through the reach of your hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of engineering , using manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are physical and a conscious conscious conscious change for their movements , identify each other and perceive the intricacies of our relatives with them , then we can start with the exploration of new and more entertaining .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the <unk> <unk> , and if i put it into a direction , you &apos;ll go back to the video , and when i push it into the other direction , it runs backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them side-by-side , you &apos;ll get your interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the , you &apos;ll notice that and can be nervous .
and they feel also their movements and slope .
an interesting episode of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like color as you do with fluids .
in this case we &apos;ve got three <unk> as a <unk> , and i can use them to pour color into the middle where they are then mixed .
if we overdo it , we can do a little bit of .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or engineering , where we &apos;re trying to give people the possibility of rapid trial and the results right right .
here i &apos;m ... this is a number of numbers i &apos;m with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , every round of every round of <unk> randomly randomly got to make words , and you &apos;re trying to make words , they &apos;re going to fill in a dictionary .
then , after 30 seconds , it &apos;s rebuilt again and you have a new <unk> and new opportunity .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab , i could move them out and took a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact in this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t need to give people many instructions .
everything you need to say is &quot; words words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another few people who test it .
this is our recent <unk> of water down there .
it turned out that he wanted to do the only stack of water .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive version system .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is rocket .
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the <unk> from the table to show this character .
here he makes the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he puts a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yeah !
by shaking the <unk> and it moves aside each side , he can do the characters ...
... his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open end and he can decide how it developed .
flying cat .
the last example , for i &apos;ve been time today , this is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the <unk> as sound like <unk> , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can pull these sounds into the sequence that you can can do in any patterns .
and you &apos;re just asking them by simply a <unk> of a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live in like hall and filters .
you connect it with a certain note and then tends to add it to the .
and then even more dramatic effects like tempo , volume that you &apos;re going to do on the sequence .
so we see .
we start where we put the <unk> into two <unk> and put them into a row , extend and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i throw a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something drums on this .
and now i hook the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by which one or another direction .
and now i put the filters again with the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it is .
so i don &apos;t have to plan them up forever , it can make them push and extend and more even more .
and finally finally , i can wrap the sequence by looking at the <unk> .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new <unk> , which fits better as our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you one part of this new <unk> and some of the ways that we work on our lab .
the thought i want to give you on the path is that we have on this threshold to this new generation of interaction with digital media , with digital media that makes information into our world that &apos;s causing our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m excited about talking to you all !
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m excited that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so , what should be <unk> ?
i just got to step back to a little step back , and it &apos;s about modern biology biology .
i study molecular biology and research in this for a few years , and i started , because i was just trying to know , and it was mainly trying to do what i learned in study research .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like this .
i think that biology biology biology is in general , biotechnology , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on , and so on , we &apos;ve got synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now is critically important , and even more , more important , more important in future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like this entire genetically engineered plants that they genetically engineered plants .
there is craig venter in the <unk> , which is trying to make <unk> , so gasoline from algae .
there are also things that are totally big in everyday life , what most people don &apos;t realize , for example , that we &apos;re going to have <unk> , for example , that allow us to wash your degrees wash , they are genetically modified .
and the list can continue over endlessly .
and so what &apos;s interest in this technology , i &apos;m going to keep in this technology , i &apos;m going to keep on .
so what why now hack ?
most people know most people from the <unk> .
computers meat , and then it will be always like this , and it &apos;s going to break down somewhere somewhere somewhere and claws and they &apos;re down .
this is kind of very sad for the <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t exactly what they actually started doing , and what it &apos;s actually about it .
and they &apos;ve got the <unk> , in the 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also the internet .
and it &apos;s about a game , creative , original way , to solve a problem .
and problem , this is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a <unk> , which simplify things like things , so you can do something else , and how can you make it better .
and it was planted with software , but there &apos;s also a whole thing that there &apos;s is there , there &apos;s a whole bunch of <unk> that are doing all kinds of things that are doing all kinds of things .
and now , just towards biology , and i want to think this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , take that biology is actually a basic crisis , because , the neural code is an abstract code , which is that it &apos;s dynamic , which is dynamic , which is what is dynamic , which is dynamic .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can code and you can also do it as well , so , and i found it incredibly fascinating , and i was just trying to get much deeper with it .
this actually has just been eight really , really , these networks .
there &apos;s a <unk> dotcom , this is originally from switzerland , this is europe and with cooperation in india , but now now members or active people are everywhere in the world .
so this is a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s lots of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists with these technologies and asking questions and creating creative , there &apos;s <unk> and , and we &apos;re doing creative , there &apos;s a lot of things .
but it &apos;s always about this way that they &apos;re able to find a such a tool that they &apos;re trying to have an playful deal with this .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , <unk> .
this is from the network of the network , which is actually more kind of forum where you &apos;re going to be true and online .
they &apos;re a bit technical approach and a bit more noisy , then they &apos;re going to ask questions .
and based on these networks that made the whole popular popular , it has developed this scene that i want to have a long time .
here &apos;s the image on the side on the top on the top , you see , this is a <unk> , so basically , a kind of school , this is a private school , a private school company , where everyone can do .
children , old , all kinds of people go to just walk through this , they have a lab and look at what you can do when they &apos;re these <unk> .
here on the left side here is a group in indonesia , <unk> means that there &apos;s quite a long time .
more than these other networks .
they &apos;re also doing in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also , also , it &apos;s also working on quite a kind of functional way .
a group of ankara i &apos;ve learned a while long ago , which is a <unk> that they wanted to tell the public more what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve made people who are doing so much as much as a result of what &apos;s <unk> .
and i got a lecture on the other image in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen with an exhibition at the conference .
and that &apos;s , yeah , that &apos;s mostly young people , but the only thing that is actually all together , this fascinated with technology .
and what you can do with it and just in the society , and ask them , and ask , okay , what you want to do , have your interest in doing your interest in doing this ?
so , <unk> , to hack biology , you might have some material .
you need biological materials , and you also need tools , and this is then one lab .
or whatever you understand under a lab , they &apos;re sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely positive , just for <unk> , trained academics with phd artists , trained academics with a ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that actually don &apos;t have to do this .
this isn &apos;t necessary because every one of each time each of each time has developed technology is actually developed technology than most of the <unk> , that &apos;s really .
and s o with this premise with this premise , then , after example brian <unk> was trying to have a <unk> , and then took a <unk> , and then took a <unk> , and , yes , so <unk> , and then it &apos;s been built .
so every one that &apos;s already a soup of that it has gone too long , again .
i then tried to take home in my lab , and then i &apos;d put on ebay on ebay and bought a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so that &apos;s like this as an <unk> .
now , this should not be a joke .
here in the image here here , you see the lab , in <unk> , so it &apos;s a very functional garage with it , and it &apos;s also possible , all kinds of <unk> that has been in university , a group in paris , which is what has established and fairly interesting things , i want to do a project .
and this is <unk> , which just mentioned , this , this , sort of a kind of <unk> principle for molecular biology .
and yeah , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s just from people who do it alone , to large , so far greater organizations , which are actually operating on more effective in their own form .
but always always the idea that it &apos;s just just and be available .
the first project we &apos;ve made as international group , as we were aware of ourselves , we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , we &apos;re also aware of this as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are chatting and so .
and then came from the <unk> website called the founder of the founder , and has said , we &apos;ve got to meet now , also now , now , and also put two events , one in london , <unk> 10 , and waiting for a moment in san francisco .
and then then it was also about , yeah , yeah , who are we are , what we want , what do we want to say , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our basis ?
and then we have a <unk> system .
this was fairly intuitive , so everybody has just just like his wish , his and what he said , expressed , put it , then .
there came to my opinion , i thought , a good code .
and then we have it doesn &apos;t fix it , but that &apos;s really , i think it has relatively good by that , people are right now that &apos;s right .
and then we actually tried to do it again in the academic world , but there &apos;s not something that &apos;s not that .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> , in terms of the , even one step than the academic world .
yeah , what for projects do we actually do ?
one project i did with the <unk> in switzerland was that we wanted to invent an optical trap or optical optical device .
this is when you focused on a laser , you can get small particles in the room , and you get small particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move into this focus , so you &apos;re going down there , like one like this one , like this one .
this really works that &apos;s done in academic academic , and we thought , we thought , we &apos;ve got a little bit , we &apos;ve got a webcam , we &apos;ve taken a webcam , the heat structure , the lens , you &apos;ve got a microscope that &apos;s blown up about <unk> .
you see this down there .
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the laser <unk> the laser , and then trying to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned lots of things .
so another project that from the french group from paris , which has worked , this is pretty cool .
and it &apos;s got a way that it &apos;s a way that you have a <unk> , so , or something like this , so it has been busy with <unk> , his favorite system is sam <unk> .
he then built this one helmet there , and in cooperation with the museum , we went .
then then they could go inside the room , put on this chair , put this helmet up .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought they thought or how they &apos;ve thought , is different lights in space .
was a fairly <unk> project .
another thing from the united states that has just done with this <unk> , is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying gene , to multiply , <unk> , fragments , to reproduce that you can make them visible .
so if i do this , the <unk> , the scene , then go down there , collect any <unk> , and then they put this method then , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to this person , that &apos;s like this .
and the machines that do something that are fairly expensive that you buy commercially , the cheapest ones go out of the mess that you &apos;re going to go .
and this is not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s really a really cool technology that can also be much .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got two two two builders and said , <unk> , we &apos;re making easier and cheaper , and then we have open source , so freely available hardware , so that this device is actually the <unk> , and they are now the cheapest of these devices around the world .
i think that &apos;s sort of six dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely a framework where it &apos;s going to be available to it .
so i think it &apos;s a very selfish hack .
one project i started recently had was a <unk> model .
<unk> is , yeah , like this kind of <unk> , which is called about this far , two centimeters or something .
you charge <unk> on the <unk> and then the <unk> then put into these <unk> , and then i took them up and shot on <unk> and then put it like this .
so the device you see here is it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype that i had looked at but pretty nerdy , so on this branch , this thing on this branch , on it , on it and pressure on it , and it was the pressure was too high , and it was the thing .
and then i took a <unk> and put it together .
a <unk> , if you get the full power with water , it has enough pressure , so i think i think , 40 to <unk> bar .
and then you can add particles too much enough , and then they go into your onion .
and the commercial device costs about 1.2 euros upwards , or something like this , the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable .
so , and that &apos;s the moment that we &apos;re just the same part of the scene , and increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and the energy industry , that more people can get involved in there .
because , as early in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it and also not a chance to make sure really good .
because if you read about it , from <unk> , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve had it yourself or seen .
and i think technology is always more important in our modern societies .
and if you have a citizen of civic decisions in society , you want to meet and meet with your own , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it and understand .
and then the <unk> , under the <unk> open <unk> and citizen science .
so you &apos;re going to put together as citizens in the way that we &apos;re going to do with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are people who put at at least at at least , on website , <unk> website .
this is quite a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interesting is also that they are represented in asia .
i think that &apos;s i think that &apos;s there are fewer people than actually there are .
so i know some of some who didn &apos;t put it .
and these are just the most common ones , individual people .
partly also , in part , in part , these places combined .
and this is actually beginning .
as i said , it &apos;s just begun .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first one , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> that are represented in the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re also also more inclusive and then more inclusive , and then they &apos;re very much connected , so that they &apos;re going to be involved in it .
and i would invite everyone to invite everyone to take on this and try to try to try and try .
it &apos;s not so easy , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get far far .
thank you for listening .
that was it .
yeah , hi .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that was very moving to me as designer , but also in the field of <unk> and in the field of the area of the area of the area .
there &apos;s how you meet people in interactive media so they can use this interactive media and create it a very specific experience .
because i think the interactive media is in us , cognitive models , so that &apos;s paradigm that has been programmed in our biology , and we &apos;re able to create this very much through interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these things that you &apos;ve faced with that they actually leads to the future , but actually it &apos;s that the future is exactly at us , in our own .
so what are we actually doing ?
i &apos;ve been written four times , and i want to explain briefly .
so , to cognitive cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial times .
so to these online models , we heard that we &apos;re essentially an equal relationship to virtuality .
this sounds basically unusual .
i &apos;m going to go back on this , and then you &apos;ll prove you to try that it &apos;s a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to have since these kinds of models of models are very , very , very metaphorically , even though we &apos;re using a natural language today .
and the third area that explains itself from itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition , which includes the denial of linearity , and what we naturally says is that we feel that linearity is true today .
fourth point is that the story is a place for us .
so , how is this with virtuality that is actually the most fundamental thing in the world .
i want to prove this to you .
how many doors has the house where they live ?
so we &apos;re not going to answer them instantly , but it &apos;s going to happen and happen right now .
they go through this house , in the front of you live , and look at how many doors are there .
and exactly what they do .
they &apos;re just doing the reality , without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to put it into the <unk> , for example , to the virtual reality in our online community , we can actually show this all the time .
and this power to the virtual reality that they have to do , they have needed to be used to be necessary for the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or no one didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have media media .
the only thing had had her head .
and in this head , memory was going .
in this head , knowledge , and using this virtual pictures , imagination , was passed passed away .
and so it &apos;s also as strong as we &apos;re rooted with virtuality as well .
what &apos;s interesting about it is when i could make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that at this time of human beings was in the same time and medium himself .
now if you think a little bit more thinking .
what are media ?
then they &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;ll get to talk about this again .
the most essential tool for the world &apos;s system has been always been informed .
<unk> , preacher , called <unk> , were extra away to preserve knowledge .
and we still add very much , very strong stories .
the author of the book was the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we still ask them a year of <unk> hours with the stories of stories .
this means for a child that has been to reach the most of the time of the most time of life has spent the most time of stories .
now we think our love story depends on that we were sitting on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this goes far back , in the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as a particularly impressive is that we &apos;ve stuck in a biological memory , the ability to think about .
i brought them an example of the north american tribe of the <unk> tribe .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very selfish area , and you had to navigate there , sort of floating from island to the island to raise food .
and they did this so-called so-called <unk> .
you may know , you know , if you &apos;re interested in this , from australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they &apos;ve used this as much as <unk> as well as <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topology of regions could be mapped about songs .
using language of the language was called <unk> .
this means you &apos;re going to be <unk> about sounds and about rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm has coined the geology , and it has also demonstrated that you could make these songs and put together different and move together and move on on the left and then move back to the right .
why don &apos;t we sing better to get from the top of a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happening happening ?
this is this this thing that happens as much as a age age .
we &apos;ve moved to what called the <unk> .
it &apos;s happening on age age , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the book .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the its own production of our individual memory on our individual memory .
it &apos;s on the book and the image .
so we &apos;ve got god &apos;s god , unfortunately , a piece of <unk> .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known <unk> of the <unk> , is so far to say that this mass media , it &apos;s called the book and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on , what we call as media media , that this is what we &apos;ve got as media media , and we have our ability to have our ability to have <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little bit of <unk> .
from the age of age age .
what has influences on our thinking and our minds ?
then the smartest culture is the pre-industrial cultures .
and they are been more inclusive over the course of centuries , and more <unk> by the influences of the .
this means , instead of individually , we &apos;ve got a big , far common , pervasive patterns of memories that we can put our personal memory .
we don &apos;t produce anymore .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t ask the things that things don &apos;t matter in pictures , but we &apos;re going to make them our language .
we &apos;ve used to that things happen .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as law , and there are only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what has remained left us is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re very much arrested as a welder &apos;s disease .
the question is , what &apos;s coming ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the age age , and we &apos;re going to take this called the so-called <unk> .
this sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> , which bring us to bring us back back to our skills again .
there is virtuality . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain this briefly .
there are technical concepts like this , like this darwinian reality , which is the distributed reality .
so if you look at google guys , you &apos;re looking at , then this concept , which is what the virtual world is communicating with the real world , which is our energy system to make the virtual version of the virtual language that is going to be addressed again .
another example is called virtual reality .
so crazy , of course , that sounds like this , that &apos;s where we &apos;re moving in not <unk> virtual worlds , quite after the model of the <unk> .
and other example , there are the most vulnerable , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a person .
all that needs the ability , our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i graduated from graduating and i hope that video works , a very , very nice project brought out , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two two are here today .
maybe you can stand up briefly so you can talk about the and talk about this project .
and this project i brought me as an example of this , like this <unk> , cognitive models .
all this is a game , i must say .
what &apos;s extremely modified , and it &apos;s a computer games .
and if i say games , you &apos;ve got very likely to see that any people who do somebody else before any <unk> or that they play with some of some <unk> in your hand .
anyway , they do that in .
this is a game for out .
and this is focused on thinking that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game combines the virtual world , so the data that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize i must be so much .
you can tell you much better , there &apos;s more much more behind .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at which places are positive or negative .
and so i get from the city to another sight , a different impression , which i see negative zones of a city and get a whole thing that &apos;s a whole thing , a whole , virtual landscape of a very real city .
and we &apos;re going to look at this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you see .
natural world lives in the walls of our cities , yeah .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to wrap this up my talk , and in the sense that the qualities and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the <unk> <unk> , and that we &apos;ve been able to get on this way that so-called <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve been able to get on this way that so-called <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve been able to get out to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag has been a little bit of a bag and i &apos;m going to talk about it .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m going to be just going to resolve what &apos;s inside .
but i &apos;ve just do it as n .
yeah , children are inherently curious or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a set of <unk> , i &apos;m about , and i &apos;m also obsessed with the subject of curiosity and how curiosity do it again , and why we &apos;re going to lose it and why we &apos;ve lost it and so on .
this is a whole bunch of things that you &apos;re going to be on the actual experience as a creator .
if professors are curious , they are often going to be in such n .
and that &apos;s what i had last half half half year .
a <unk> issue on natural user interface .
now they &apos;re going to ask questions , why are all the names of these kinds of creatures of all the <unk> , <unk> <unk> communication communication , interact and so on .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices high , because things are always always more intuitive , more more , more natural , <unk> , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us , of course , what is <unk> or intuitively .
and before the background i &apos;ve got to design design on the realm of natural users , so the next generation in relation to human computers in which human computer is dealing with how our tools or how our tools or how our tools could change from computers to the computer .
so i &apos;ve focused on what &apos;s what &apos;s what &apos;s about or intuitively .
maybe again , look at it again .
why does this happen ?
so if we look at our society , we &apos;re going to look at this short , and then we move from the third of the third of the third or <unk> .
so from modern in the modern .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
the beginning of the language was through language .
this means that you found that you &apos;ve talked to common language , you could communicate each other , it moved into the same cave or other areas , has built cities or village , or had cities in some ways .
but the language was , but language , something very natural , something very living .
you know , you know , learning , no toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it and we &apos;re doing it .
it was then added by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because you know , of course , living language began to <unk> in form of writing , which is what <unk> and alive is , let me go and put it into rock and i &apos;m doing it .
depending on how i &apos;m going to go and when i &apos;m going to do , it &apos;s a whole different coverage than if there &apos;s one alive in this .
but then , then , then , then this writing was a <unk> , received .
then the next generation that we &apos;re actually mostly alive today .
this is just the pressure and <unk> <unk> writing with <unk> and others .
then there was just a <unk> , where <unk> , <unk> and others said : are you really crazy when the people start reading , then they want to be completely <unk> .
and now we get into the next generation and exciting , so a <unk> is only every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really really in this moment in this particular phase that we &apos;re going to work on .
and of course , it really excites us because we see on one page the new media , social media , facebook and so on .
with total transparency , what is the new thinking about what word slam against , don &apos;t tell that in the <unk> , no beef is or no beef , which is what i want to do is just <unk> and want to do this .
and these two worlds just put together , new and old thinking .
and this is exciting about that , if you look like this , this new society , these <unk> , many mechanisms , principles , basic principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but no longer on local level , but on global level .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
that this topic is a global global crisis .
not if i think locally , and your neighbor thinks less ecologically , then it doesn &apos;t work all .
this means , from local village , actually , a global village has become the same principles , very obvious , very intuitive , but also transparency transparency .
so , like you knew in the village , who has what &apos;s what happens to whom and when , this is about this extension of ourselves through this mobile state of our self .
whether we know global services and faster and better and better .
like it was happening on the village earlier .
before i &apos;ve got to look at this , what means it means , what &apos;s still for us , what we might have , what we might have , what &apos;s like , what is that makes the difference ?
because often people come , they cannot do it , so everyone can deal with it .
so you have to do it , which means that means , and not just changing it is different , but it &apos;s better better .
and then , then , then , then , it &apos;s intuitive , and how can i take effect on this as an actor , and just as they do that as they make the things that they do a <unk> , so they &apos;re intuitively intuitively , because they &apos;re just doing it .
you &apos;ve got it , too , as thought , with the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and then , of course , that &apos;s what you start and calcium calcium and says , okay , i just look inside the inner self .
and how does it look inside ?
so how do we work if we &apos;re going to do it ?
and what means , of course , what means , of course , how work our functions of perception and how does cognitive processing complexity works ?
because steve jobs said once , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at detail when i want to do something more or intuitively <unk> , which means that is the core in the core .
and there you &apos;re already going to see that you have our seven senses , most think we &apos;ve got five , we &apos;ve already been seven , because there &apos;s been seven , there &apos;s certainly seven , waiting sense , and as extension , the next , waiting sense .
and to look , how do we digest information , how do we get information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , but don &apos;t know what it means really really .
but i need to understand in the core , understanding where will information information is information , when will information data and from information information , again , i know how i could do things quite intuitively or naturally .
and of course , how design determines influence .
we see this here when i made things , i can do it confusing to the right side , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can do quite intuitive them by showing things .
so much natural natural , in a vessel , but i &apos;m going to look directly , where salt and pepper .
and if i say somebody , give me salt or pepper , then you &apos;ll think about the right point , where is what &apos;s inside .
and then the left just access and hopefully i hope that no sugar is in there , the salt that you just give .
but also our perceptions itself , how does it make us feel like it .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small , although that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re very similar to the same , and yet our perceptions change after we do things .
anyone knows what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s something more like to my glasses .
so it &apos;s n circle .
a second circle starts to relate to certain resemblance or associating .
and then if i get a <unk> , we &apos;ll see a bit more than one unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see any three parts , a circle , one circle , one circle , another one .
it &apos;s called <unk> or just <unk> , which is affecting us in perception .
so important for the creator , they mostly went in the first semester , the great ones .
<unk> closeness , <unk> of the continuity and so on .
often again , forgot about again .
but this is an essential important component , if you just want to make things quite intuitively .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting is that &apos;s looking at looking .
sounds very trivial , but it &apos;s very fascinating , but very interesting , when you &apos;re closer to it .
so we have the eyes on front of the front , and now you think , we see from front of the beginning .
this is wrong .
you see it from back to the back .
because they &apos;re a presumption , looking at a presumption that you see something you recognize , <unk> circle .
this means we &apos;re just looking at our vision , and then we see it back back back into our <unk> , to say , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay ,
i &apos;ve got such cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
so this is then there , then it comes back again .
then again , again , it &apos;s because the back of the back doesn &apos;t say and says , now , please , please , and you &apos;re sure if what you see is , it &apos;s what you &apos;re looking at .
and then again , it goes back back and then it &apos;s just seen .
so a whole , very inclusive process , like certain things are happening and what things happen for these things .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s shown from you .
there &apos;s exactly what happens exactly what i described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
does somebody see something ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw this , that that &apos;s a no-brainer in there , you know that .
they &apos;re never forgotten it anymore because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and then , you &apos;re always looking at it .
this means , i &apos;ve actually made her in the outside that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns , but i &apos;ve got them in a short period of time again , again , again , this dog &apos;s image .
and this is this projection projection , <unk> , see .
now i know it and now i &apos;m going to go forward to the front of i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so all right , very exciting processes that then , in this , yeah , gray , you don &apos;t actually , but here &apos;s what &apos;s happening in this very much as much as a little bit .
anyone knows what three seconds ?
long , yeah .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i sort of put out of the present , i can do very well <unk> , i &apos;m just talking about it by just three seconds .
it &apos;s got to be very much as present .
then it moves into the past , and so i can bridge very elegantly <unk> for example on computer if i know this phenomena .
what does it take to milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
also an interesting phenomena .
this is the time you love in love .
that means , if you know now , you pay attention to you like a long term , because i don &apos;t take any <unk> for what could happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also an interesting phenomena .
this is the time of most perceptions that we have .
this is , this first impression happens in a rapid rapid speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we sort of pushed us against our environment , so we can think about this accordingly .
of course , the creator of the creator doesn &apos;t only have to do with the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but mostly , of course , with the subject of the climate crisis .
so like a person about a person about certain things .
there &apos;s a practical functions , so there &apos;s some practical functions , so that &apos;s what &apos;s happening is something that is happening .
there are <unk> where i know exactly where i got to reach .
but there are symbolic functions , why is somebody like a little bit of <unk> , where don &apos;t even do any more <unk> , so much more comfortable , so much of money , even though it isn &apos;t that practical ?
we &apos;re more likely to be on the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we &apos;re as a creator of course .
back to my actual subject of natural users interface and the subject , which is also <unk> .
so , <unk> means how can i get a certain target , or how can one users have a specific diagnostic tool in one particular response to effective effective and efficient and <unk> goal .
so &apos;s more like the norm .
how can i make some more comfortable ?
i can do this right or i need &apos; n or i need &quot; an effective training for it .
and less <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s .
i do it just different and nice , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then then , then , in part of the software that we saw , it &apos;s going to look at it , you &apos;ll understand why , why percent of our current software are intuitively intuitively intuitively , or not usable on the information system that &apos;s actually much more intuitive than classic software .
and this is intuitive enough engineers not just since apple <unk> a elementary , <unk> , if i want to harness technological devices .
why ?
because in the rule we &apos;re talking about this new kind of <unk> , so that natural user is going to be more likely to be five times faster than average .
you have to imagine that if you make some of the classic <unk> , five hours need and with this new kind of natural software just one hour .
this doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re probably going to go home four hours more , but your employers or anyone would think about how he &apos;s going to do it with four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a corresponding tool for us , and then it &apos;s a certain thing to do .
so if we put it back again into the field of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> interfaces that were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then then the next thing that are already going to have done with &quot; a lot of brain neural model or mental model , like software , have been working on , which is what we had thought of something that is metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so no more zeros and zeros or or <unk> code , but just a metaphor .
this was a lot of <unk> , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so i made a lot more often as a creator of these behavior than this .
this is also a paradigm shift .
i think this looks always for the success , just the <unk> of the <unk> .
and then then then , if i step up in this natural interfaces , where i agree with voice , language , by language , by speech , by speech , by speech , by a gesture , it &apos;s not a gesture of gesture , and no longer to control things , then i &apos;m still faster and still .
but then i &apos;m going to point back to the point , when things are actually intuitive ?
if you become intuitive , and then i have to get my little friend here and look at what means this mean , because of the point of view , when is this really intuitively intuitively ?
and this is for us people always do something if i have to think about it very little bit about it .
so he doesn &apos;t want to think , but it &apos;s simply done .
and as i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does this mean for designers ?
this means if we look at that we can use existing information data from one thing to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use this on the use of the creator .
this means i can put a intuitive , human <unk> program on software and make software a lot of software .
but then , of course , the question is , what is actually this kind of <unk> of us and i &apos;ve got it .
this is called the <unk> .
this is each one of us and <unk> is an acronym and it &apos;s called your orient , <unk> , <unk> .
and all of you all all of you all all time , but it &apos;s kind of intuitive and fairly intuitive or partly instinctively .
the model is already going to be in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used by all the time , without all the time that most knew that this model is present .
so , <unk> <unk> is about 50 to more than about 50 to more than a little bit of on your activity , so you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s a lot of common time as a day .
i can now orient this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar as the metaphor of the <unk> , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> as this is the transmission of an classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m going to do this , for example , i &apos;m going to be able to look at the point of view as a review , <unk> as choice , i can look at it in detail , i can go look at it somewhere else or or you know , <unk> , i can go out somewhere or buy it somewhere else or whatever , i can do it somewhere else or or you know , and you know , <unk> or whatever , i can do it somewhere else or or you know ,
then i can transmit this whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
so everybody has ate pies .
perspectives : now i &apos;m using the object , you can do it again , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get all the whole overview of this , and can say this , and you can say , just show me all of this thing with chocolate .
and once on one interface , which is much intuitive and much more natural .
because i can get things like the bits of reach , and they come on to me is much natural than thinking about <unk> demands websites or other mechanisms , some kinds of mechanisms could make these things available .
imagination is more inclusive of <unk> , and with this sentence i want to close to a and again , a and again , also need to think differently to get on new solutions , and i &apos;m going to thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing when you become a child , as baby , it &apos;s about it , what you &apos;re doing , what you do , yes ? and depending on whether your parents allowed them to play more or less or less , the more , the curiosity that they have in the process .
and curiosity don &apos;t learn .
so all of these are all that are here and curious , actually people who have an property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m about this , practically this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years to implement in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
<unk> a opportunity .
every day they &apos;re going to give them a little bit of 100 grams of phosphorus , each day they have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bones bones .
we could just glide as a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t take phosphorus and give us out .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re talking about something that is actually a <unk> , but not that &apos;s not that way .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much critical .
we &apos;re down from two countries .
we &apos;ve only been using phosphorus for two years , and now now through the world &apos;s system , we &apos;ve been used much more uranium in the environment as in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years alone , <unk> tons of uranium has been distributed on our fields in germany .
and we take it all .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment , if we &apos;re a bit less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , drive less cars .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
but this is not protection .
this is like if i would say , your kid , shut it only three times less than five times .
this is just a few of destruction .
if we think about the <unk> of the world &apos;s til the <unk> , our entire earth will be used to be a cemetery or later .
so that &apos;s about thinking about the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first .
in the ground , there is 60 percent of the solar muscle .
now , we &apos;re going to build corn and lose corn between 11 and 30 pounds of zero acres or or on the meter of sports .
that means we lose about five thousand times more than being hacked .
we can actually look at the <unk> .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in <unk> , 20 percent of the <unk> are <unk> .
and because we are getting older , they will be more greater .
this is they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yeah ?
a baby needs about six thousand .
we could do that of course 10 percent , but what does this do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we get to this diapers ?
here one of the evidence that men don &apos;t are pigs .
i want to tell you .
because average is going to be the <unk> of the declining parts of the .
they &apos;re talking about the urine .
yeah .
so men don &apos;t be pigs .
because this is what we can do it ?
we &apos;ve traditionally think in the world &apos;s crisis , we are too many in the world .
and if you get people when you get people to get them out of people , if you say that would be better , you &apos;re not there , they &apos;re going to be <unk> and lean .
and this is what somebody like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing to be honest than darwin .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a human income , you &apos;re going to do the earth .
here &apos;s how you &apos;re more comfortable , better .
yeah .
the first question is , we are really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then they weigh four times more than we &apos;re humans .
i could take termites on another , but in america , no one like a little bit like , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that ants weigh much more than we .
and because they &apos;re physically working harder than we do and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they correspond to your weight , in your weight consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yeah ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re gone away , what we really wanted to do and could do , and how sad we are that we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that for example , <unk> , you can see that , for example , <unk> , you want to be <unk> here , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t , yes ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yeah ?
one ?
this means , our whole intelligence means that we want dumber than trees , yeah ?
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
happiness isn &apos;t , yeah ?
there &apos;s no <unk> trees .
there are still six billion trees alone in the air .
you &apos;ve heard something about the trees of trees ?
this means that all our intelligence means that we want dumber than trees .
and where you see , even something like demeter , the <unk> agriculture , not allowed that our own food system is going back .
every year we &apos;re going to lose three million tons of phosphorus that really need to go back in loops .
and we are too many .
alone .
that means we feel so guilty on earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as they &apos;re all called the means that our own food system go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
it &apos;s secure meaningful to be less harmful , which is in terms of <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economics , but when it goes around the environment , it &apos;s highest , not there , yeah ?
<unk> , yeah ?
they can only have <unk> if they &apos;re not there .
even if you would shoot you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
we can do it different .
we can get our nutrients back .
we do agriculture in brazil in which we get nutrients back .
right , we can get into this way that we can do it in agriculture .
we do this in china for example , where we &apos;re just taking away from them .
in china , a chinese is still called a solar system today , right , right ?
and in our western world we were too stupid , our nutrients .
this means that the whole west is struck by that the city has always taken , but they never returned something has been returned .
so they had had to grow more because farmers went into cities and cities had had to get to get their nutrients .
so all of western empires are always expanding until they couldn &apos;t get done the infrastructure , and then they are <unk> .
yeah ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a hundred thousand years of years of thousand years because you were able to get nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to lunch in china , you expect to be for food , you &apos;re going to stay in your head until you &apos;re looking at the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , to take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see on the internet , how you can get nutrients back .
this is actually nice about it , if you do this , so agriculture makes it biogas , you can make a hectare of a hectare of people in favelas , can a farmer for about <unk> dollars and they &apos;re waiting for them , chickens and vegetables and vegetables .
and the amazing thing about this is that the <unk> in favelas about 90 percent goes back .
so we don &apos;t need to control people to be bad .
we can support them , be good .
this is natural gas , but the sanitation is wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design that a farmer can simply breathe them .
that means that the <unk> is going back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve built over the last 20 years , no one of these facilities ever had been spiked .
they could simply be a liter of <unk> , and then it would be ruined over years .
not happen .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people to be bad .
we can support them , be good .
that means we need to have phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to put on , in germany , the best way of treatment treatment in the state of food treatment .
unfortunately , not in the business , but maybe you can do a little bit of a bit of it .
because the <unk> device could be best the phosphorus back .
and it needs to go back .
we see that phosphorus-based is truly critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really possible .
we &apos;ve used us over three years now .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country worldwide , what phosphorus is .
but we need this overall .
understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to replace oil by other energy energy .
but average phosphorus is not going to replace .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing slightly less miserable , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s mainly to ask , what &apos;s right .
that means it &apos;s efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , obviously , it understands that easier because holland is built on flowers .
yeah ?
imagine if your wife &apos;s sad when you have them , and they come with 50 roses .
completely inefficient .
but quite effective , yeah , yeah ?
or take a <unk> .
one woman in germany is about six pounds of three kilograms during her life .
it .
this isn &apos;t exactly exactly right because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to do .
but a <unk> , even in this illumination , i can tell you , is entirely inefficient , but it effectively effectively , right ?
one thing in life is beautiful , isn &apos;t efficient .
so that &apos;s not efficiency efficiency , but efficiency .
questions , what is the right ?
not , not to burn a little better and it &apos;s <unk> and to lose all the materials for the same materials , but first to ask , how do you get together ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yeah ?
if i went to dinner , and say , yeah , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , sir ?
this is efficient .
everything in life is beautiful , isn &apos;t efficient .
if you do yourself in somebody &apos;s loved ?
yeah ?
that means everything in life matters is not saving it , avoid it .
all the <unk> .
we say people , oh yeah , you haven &apos;t got a green green in the south .
no , that &apos;s just throwing away right , yeah ?
every place where you &apos;re hallucinating , yes , you get back again .
but the false things .
if you get the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
we think from north north .
there &apos;s any footprint in it .
if you run , yeah , everybody footprint down the ground .
because the ground will die down the mosses , and the wind and the water is wash the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everyone means that the water is longer in the grassland .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is going to be a marsh .
not rocket science .
we say in germany .
yeah ?
but if i ask them , how do you get your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yeah ?
this is just the minimum .
so not saving , none of the wars .
each waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s lust , if you see in italy , like people in the high bow , you get out of the car , you get out of the car .
because you know , this is a darwinian process .
it &apos;s &quot; kind of <unk> , yeah ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a <unk> system , for example , is at room room room .
they can get them out where they go and stand .
it &apos;s going to be all over two hours .
and it contains seeds from rare plants so that they &apos;re throwing away in biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so they are two loops .
not all of course , is supposed to be <unk> .
a tv or a washing machine , they use them just they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that are <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , who have to be in biological systems .
the things that are only used , in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about biological systems .
yeah ?
for example of the <unk> , yeah ?
but direct ads , not for the company in se , but for that , now , you now help this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do things out of things .
yeah ?
so if i &apos;m going to eat it , and say , it &apos;s free from <unk> , you don &apos;t help you .
no , we &apos;re stuck , which is inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
no toxic inside .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes you can put on the <unk> of the <unk> and the rubber in biological loops , yeah ?
everything is about it .
and if it works , it &apos;s going to be our <unk> for nike , for nike and the whole textile industry .
and this is half all the world &apos;s worldwide , which are caused by the textile industry .
so they help with , ask them to ask them .
hey , <unk> , power is you really seriously ?
because they &apos;ve changed twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure if they really really do .
so , help me some of this .
but it &apos;s going .
yeah .
what &apos;s been shown right now .
this .
we can do things now that they do when they &apos;re hallucinating , if they &apos;re <unk> , they can do it in biological cycles .
technical collapses are just like it .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> program for this .
this is the first green backpack , actually , that &apos;s done to go back into the circulation .
so again , so , in every store you can get things out .
if you come on this , yeah ?
remember the <unk> ?
if right right right now , the waste is .
everywhere are diapers , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s on the front line on the front of the , but anyway ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the climate change , that they can just go back on the <unk> , you can have a baby in israel or in tunisia , and in tunisia .
yeah ?
if you take these these tiles , they &apos;re <unk> , sterilized and the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s <unk> for all life , already from beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> <unk> .
yeah , kind of .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent again again .
i founded an institute .
now , there are lots of people working there , and they can all get involved .
there are extra group of <unk> where everybody can come together .
so no longer saving , none of them , avoid , no , not a <unk> , but intelligent waste .
does she feel this ?
thank you .
work of the <unk> .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote written in my talk , i was like a <unk> , i &apos;m going to understand , in english , i understand .
<unk> are about the written notes of music in music .
that you just just simply put word for word to the text into another language , but it needs to understand the deeper meaning of words and engineering sets , so it has to make a meaningful translation , knows that everyone who has to do with <unk> .
to translate to english , you can make more knowledge , especially if you go around poetry or anything about poetry .
but it &apos;s very strange , but it &apos;s what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> of a <unk> , i just had the written notes .
they certainly think that the composer was just anything that he has imagined .
in fact , the scores are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about exactly the same or <unk> , like a verbal , if you seem very comfortable , description of a landscape .
because in this particular <unk> , the smell of flowers don &apos;t smell that they don &apos;t get the end of the <unk> , to hear the <unk> of the <unk> doesn &apos;t feel that .
this means , the role of the role has to be able to make this <unk> effect of the <unk> in another , namely , specific , nonverbals .
today i want to tell you what i would translate musically , so i &apos;ll translate a language again again .
so basically , translation translation translation .
so i &apos;m going to salute the whole rather than , because if i had to translate it again in english , it would be something like translation translation in translation .
so that &apos;s the music works for me as much as spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of a writing .
so it doesn &apos;t get to learn to read notes and put the buttons on the piano or the right location on a <unk> .
because this is just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the sense of letters you can see when you can do language .
so you need to make music for at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also a <unk> whether you learn it for the learning experience , passively understand , or you can talk to active , to the musical speaker .
the work of the water starts like a kind of <unk> .
after you first have chosen to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you just put it from a time of the origin of the composition .
you collect information about the piece of the .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from composers .
you studied the works that he did before and then made .
you compare comparison .
the <unk> , writing it .
how and what did he feel ?
how were his circumstances , like society and politics ?
all i &apos;m interested in .
you think in this time , you &apos;re looking at contemporary pictures , or read literature .
but it &apos;s also a role for the time as an interpreter of a rich knowing the composers that you play over time , and it &apos;s easier to be able to get yourself and feel .
the crowd is always going to be more to my friend that you live together .
his cause to write the piece , will always be more and more my personal concerns to play .
now , there &apos;s the notes that all of the notes is a detailed record of the cause of composers , but just a framework , i &apos;m now turning this framework to make it back again with meaning and meaning .
i then say my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i &apos;m playing what these sounds could have .
now for me and for the composers , then , what they might mean for him today .
every note that every phrase is getting a sense because i feel it myself because it comes from my my personal <unk> .
it has to be in here and now , and i can &apos;t convince my audience to convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a happy concert again , if i could have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve developed for so long as i &apos;ve developed in advance .
how you &apos;ve experienced a happy new day again , even though with the same rituals of life , get up , breakfast , breakfast , work , i would keep the same piece over again again .
i &apos;ve got more over again , over time , seasons , my pulse goes down at night than the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer that sound back back back back back back home .
i suppose the audience , true , or unconscious .
all of these things affect me and all that affects my experience with the composition .
so , quite wonderful , if i stand on a wall on stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea in and asked this answer to a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we don &apos;t have any and what you can &apos;t do and what you can &apos;t do .
it makes great fun to make music , and you as the audience has experienced what music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i will never play more like this , like this moment .
i can &apos;t play this as 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more more inclusive than today today , and i &apos;m going to have a much more attention to my palette of the world , emotion and emotion than today .
certainly , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> , but also new <unk> .
i have a nice concrete example .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> for my beloved old schoolteacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a well-known <unk> , <unk> and long-term professor of the <unk> in the <unk> .
unfortunately , i was too young too young , so he was already been <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had fortunate enough , it was very early , 13 years , meet and i was my school classes in my school .
i was 17 when i came back on a class , and i played the last of the four million towers of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the preamble of this <unk> for me .
this is such a part of a difference .
and i said , i was obsessed with my favorite research .
he &apos;s doing it and said , &quot; like this ?
this has to be the <unk> .
because for me , you mean memory .
he was already over 60 .
well , with 17 has just dreams , but no significant memories .
i &apos;m playing this piece of time today , and over again , and it has gone away for me , although no single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again i read something new .
an example of a different field . monet has painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but different different forms of light , in some of the light .
he has translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , like they looked like it .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the most terrifying interpretation of a piece is like this .
now i &apos;ve been older as chopin was talking about the chopin when he wrote this piece .
he was only lived in years .
and i &apos;m important to look back into the notes , even if i mean to memorized them .
to keep the <unk> , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said yes , you need about just as long as about spoken language .
often , the most common thing is that you just learn the notes .
you &apos;re just learning about reading before you just talking one word .
you learn that sounds to find notes on the instrument .
if all of your fingers in time and right as it &apos;s in the notes , they come out sounds like music like music .
if that happens to all , students get the <unk> piece .
it doesn &apos;t even talk about interpretation in the <unk> .
well , there &apos;s a gentleman on front , this is a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you .
but even as you put these data , it &apos;s still something technical .
and yet it &apos;s always not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something about a whole thing .
because that &apos;s that to make music on the instrument that should make your musical and feel before .
which is called the singing .
one kid who didn &apos;t learn that without having parents don &apos;t have to do it , it will not do it .
this is like the <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to get it over another possibility , so to make it for sound , to sound .
people who never sing , they never had a conscious body , as it is to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the music music is the extension of our body .
and to sing our vocal tape , to sing our hands and dance .
so the <unk> of the piano in the piano of my fingers .
the melody emerges from the <unk> and rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make music even better if it becomes a boring .
no need to sing a diamond whistle or singing .
every person &apos;s music will be <unk> if you &apos;re going to be out from the outside with music .
certainly , there are some among you who say , yes , but what do you do if i couldn &apos;t sing ?
i ask that , you can &apos;t sing , a because you believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
and both of them is not too late to start trying to find out whether they can &apos;t do it or learn how to make these little muscles that put the vocal chords , right .
they &apos;re going to train .
or c , because you &apos;ve got them out of them , they &apos;re <unk> .
i ask how <unk> competent was this diagnosis ?
did you get a <unk> or <unk> , how you say it beautiful ?
or d : you don &apos;t like music and want to do it again .
but then i would regret because music is a beautiful , more exciting thing .
but maybe you can also even do it .
well , you see , all cases , no one has to be an explicit candidate .
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i mean , i &apos;m saying , but certainly you can say if you don &apos;t like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s tastes me because i can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t get rid of food , because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously and tell you whether it tastes you or not .
whether music is too valid or too cute .
say what they feel .
and you get them too , and they want to get some more spices there or taste even bright differences .
why i urge my audience now that it &apos;s listening to it ?
because the music is language and language is to communicate there .
a piece of art that you never see has no force .
the food that was being cooked by a chef or a chef , must be eaten and not just looked at or recipes .
so please listen to if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in an environment where the adult music are doing or even active music , you &apos;re born , it &apos;s easy for a <unk> , asking , what color does your flower ?
can you play them in blue ?
and the kid plays , after a <unk> , rather than a red flower is a blue flower .
and this sounds quite different than before .
so this was the first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written in a hundred , before or before three years ago , before three years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have been <unk> .
there was no piano at the time creek as an instrument .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think that bach would have been excited about if he had the most profound possibility of modern <unk> .
i can have the <unk> that bach has had to make on the modern wing , which is a <unk> <unk> .
and also from beethoven you know that he was hearing more than he was been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which an orchestra has rejected as a <unk> .
so the composers are on us who also also invent the pieces again .
so they &apos;re beaming out what they &apos;ve ever imagined in mind .
and also what you would think in mind today .
or what i &apos;m doing today is because what they thought they thought .
thank you .
you know what hearts is ?
were they jealous ?
and how did this feel ?
suck .
i got a friend , which is driving a <unk> .
if i come up with my little v w and i &apos;m going to ask me , this feeling comes on .
i &apos;m doing something through your head .
i say , <unk> , what you need to do is like &quot; n ?
this is what you lose for the first year , half his value .
and even , you do work much less than i .
why do i afford to do this as cute little car ?
and then immediately , i think that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this uncomfortable feeling is gone .
our organism invented a great method to make such uncomfortable feelings like envy .
you can try and try to try and say , or or or like revenge or or like .
i want to explain something today today or something that you &apos;re probably familiar with is familiar with .
the mechanism comes from lying .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard you may say , if people say , no no one has to build a wall .
and then rocks put rocks so they &apos;re going to show you the point of view .
on one lie , you see that the liar doesn &apos;t believe that he says .
it &apos;s easy to check that it has different in mind .
he &apos;s just useful it and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about that they &apos;re entitled to yourself .
you need this lie to get a <unk> to maintain an limitation .
they can get them less easily , yeah , <unk> or down .
they need time .
and from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
spanish painter named picasso once has a woman .
this woman has complained , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see her .
picasso immediately immediately , wait .
it will always be more similar .
and in this location , and if you laugh , you realize how important that lie is and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell very good .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
artist &apos;s sharing something with them , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see when you just look in the mirror .
artist &apos;s sharing them in a portrait of something like what you &apos;re going to be familiar with if you look at this artwork over again .
then this uncomfortable disappears , feeling that uncomfortable , it couldn &apos;t see you , and it &apos;s always going to be more similar .
here you have this mechanism that we can use a lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our computer tools .
and not only in art , also in the middle of the mythology , in stories , it dip again .
you may know this idea of the lady that was looking in the mirror every morning and asked him , who &apos;s most beautiful throughout the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yeah , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true inform , also can &apos;t lie out of this true penny comes out of it .
but we should just make us feel familiar with a woman , that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we &apos;ve got in <unk> <unk> , and then they put back again .
we need this lie that we need to do this is that you &apos;re not able to live on deception without that we can &apos;t even survive .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the <unk> , but also in science that &apos;s a great lie .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s wife &apos;s woman &apos;s wife .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , origin of the species and the descent of people .
that man should be from monkey , and , yes , there were a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her man and said , but i guess i &apos;m not true what charles was writing .
the man should have the monkey &apos;s or common ancestor .
no , no , no , not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to avoid people realize that .
why do we need to stop people know about something if it &apos;s true ?
because we cannot live without those <unk> .
because we &apos;re this limitation , this feeling , great , descent of the highest creatures not from such a kind of <unk> , from something like this , like a kind of kind of <unk> like an organism that exists still like that , and that &apos;s what things that is for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things .
we need to avoid people understood about things , especially if they are true .
so you see how slowly this mechanism feels out out of notes and like the traces that &apos;s behind that , that &apos;s going on something else than this great picture of ourselves , i want to show you another story .
one particularly beautiful story like i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s schoolteacher , and she told a student .
a 16-year-old student .
she likes to love him especially because he has an slope to sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the firemen .
and because i &apos;m at the firemen , i &apos;m interested in most of these things .
yeah , you feel it when you &apos;re <unk> in this location , there &apos;s not true .
i said my wife , always if a person in a moral sense that is used to be used to do it , we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
so let &apos;s do this , and then you get the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the firemen , i &apos;m interested in most of these things .
you feel that this is the actual truth behind .
so a small <unk> , who don &apos;t care about the <unk> .
they &apos;re interested in the school .
but there are no clubs that we can see us where you can learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only second second , just the firemen .
he signed up .
and then , you know , you don &apos;t say your teacher , you like to put fires somewhere and feel happy when the fire was going to be .
no , it &apos;s just much better than we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dangers that are going to get the other ones , if they put fire .
here they have this little mechanism .
this particular thing that this libertarian is that in the heart of the <unk> , that he &apos;s actually related to fire , but that he can &apos;t say loud .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and conscious , who immediately whistle without that they can do something about it , and the things that you know they can look quite different for them and make that they can sound quite better for them and others .
so just they do just say words that we &apos;ve used to use language in language right over it .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know if we do that , they are very selfish ones that are very selfish .
we can &apos;t just do this .
it &apos;s impossible , that things that work in a society that should work .
i want to show you what we &apos;ve found out in my institute .
after what logic is this deception , this limitation , the willingness , a different reality as which we actually know in conscious conscious , that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is what many of you know and some of them appreciate , quite just not need to do .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so intellectual , says about starbucks .
it &apos;s something that isn &apos;t about stop , physical nature .
and if you have people who are vulnerable , they have a soul , or you can say that they have been given from the soul to live , then they &apos;re just like the soul that &apos;s kind of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , dead .
and from this spirit , you think that she somehow sort of in this darwinian nature , in this nature nature , called it in latin , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and if this one is the <unk> , then it &apos;s going to be filled with the people , then it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature that can only live , right , with soul .
and then he can just <unk> .
this is like the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s going to come from outside to people .
so we should perceive them as something that should be present for our lives .
and if you have these premise , you understand the logic , which we &apos;re talking about happiness through a lie of a lie .
because now you can apply a solar system .
they know still from school .
now this is a <unk> that tells us an logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here they need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
and that is to lie that they simply can easily apply this logic wrong .
in this room , three sentences come out .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you have a second , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i pointed him in particular here .
a third sentence , immediately immediately comes up with people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who no soul , who &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s this logic , in this , yeah , in this <unk> speech .
you immediately see it .
the first two sentences , they are logically correct .
i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell stories about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s a man &apos;s .
if i don &apos;t have right , it &apos;s not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make testimony about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critically , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s true .
so if you say , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he has right , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
these things are logically correct .
and now our consciousness awareness immediately is , you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences and it does as if the first sentence is already proved and matched .
because actually we need to prove whether it &apos;s your soul or not .
but with this logic , which it just uses that two sentences are correct , and a third piece of reference that looks like it looks like he could be able to save something that we can save our lives .
so we do , as if it was actually impossible without able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different ways .
in the present , we &apos;ve got a modern example that keeps the <unk> .
and then you have to have another subject , a <unk> issue , thinking about philosophy .
so this has to do with this that we go back into the most century century .
there was a <unk> named johannes <unk> , named johannes <unk> , named johannes <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> which is inherently nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is this one thing .
and if you put the right in the middle between two grains of pollen , then he &apos;s going to put it .
because he doesn &apos;t know what quickly he should go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so they are introduced .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> changes each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
but just if you get another example , so if you immediately make a haystack bigger , then it doesn &apos;t need reason and no reason .
automatically runs on the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of pushed into nature , it &apos;s going to be able to get from the bigger pile that they put on immediately , then they also have a feeling that there &apos;s something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re on the <unk> , i remember the <unk> for brain science .
there &apos;s a surgeon who called wolf , and you sometimes say , wolf , wolf said , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can make another sentence again and can say if wolf has right , he has no <unk> .
these sentences are totally logically and correct .
and what we can read almost daily daily daily , you find this third sentence .
this looks like that , who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , cannot pull out for its actions and claims for the subject , and he &apos;s so <unk> .
there &apos;s again .
so you &apos;d have to prove to prove whether there &apos;s something like a little bit like a bit like .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence is wrong wrong as if you should take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do anything yourself if you want to test yourself yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , make these guts to lie .
so practice that for example , if you encounter a person you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use german word for <unk> , which is prophet .
they cannot call them , that would be a little bit politically .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately they will be a , for granted , for granted , you can see that you can &apos;t prove .
and they &apos;ve got a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not to prove that they couldn &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , it &apos;s happy happy .
he &apos;s happy about it because he lied to it .
because he has led it to a <unk> , which he doesn &apos;t retain themselves .
because actually , this person isn &apos;t interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in itself , in front of themselves , to prove to prove that there &apos;s been <unk> .
so , in the kind of shifting of the <unk> , you experience the brilliance of lying .
and once again , you have a opportunity to feel this <unk> , you do it , they do it because they &apos;re going to make others happy if they don &apos;t remember their own .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i gave me a job of thinking about whether i could mention it .
it &apos;s one of the most amazing show here , and asked me whether i wanted to hold a talk and my idea .
i must say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , i fell to talk to my idea .
and i may think i may think i &apos;m trying to introduce you .
but it &apos;s course , of course , all of ideas .
i &apos;m probably probably there , the two nice girls , i &apos;m probably probably about the generation that has been given for this bad painful image of this bad thing , because i started studying engineering engineering , engineering school , technical school , i think she &apos;s called &quot;
and i did it back the mid- &apos; 80s to berlin because i wanted to make renewables , and that &apos;s not in the business of the .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
they were all the <unk> , also called <unk> .
the hot word today .
because a good engineer has either built a little car or <unk> .
but something like the n of <unk> , from this kind of hundred watts from the square meter out of the meter , it was a toy .
and berlin , there was an crazy <unk> system .
i &apos;m thankful that he &apos;s thankful that he has a word again , because after the christmas machine , you couldn &apos;t use the word to the word at all because everything left was bad .
however , it wasn &apos;t that in the years .
there was this thing that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them sitting in <unk> in the <unk> where you suspected evil .
but the location of the <unk> , but this was called <unk> and solar power and i started the mid- &apos; 80s .
and yeah , lots of what i said today is very touched me because many , many beautiful expressions were in this way i &apos;ve lived through .
i &apos;ve worked 11 years in the collective , this was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one said no said , it was a whole thing that has been a completely <unk> , i &apos;ve got 10 years to do it , whether i &apos;m my great science theory really , i &apos;m going to get my father &apos;s my father &apos;s my father &apos;s my father &apos;s my child .
it &apos;s been wrong with insanity .
and this was really very , very , very , very , very , very , and then you get into such a phase , just showed this picture , where i asked me about 10 years , a thousand <unk> , who were going to be a great thing that was going to be really cool .
and i got it to <unk> , and then we &apos;ve got some of the <unk> of the company that was brought together with the <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s greatest <unk> system .
so , we have a <unk> , but then we have this problem of a growing enterprise and we have a small group , decided that we start and go back and go back and think that it &apos;s just crazy , and i think that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do is that they &apos;re going to talk about the next topic of the future .
and i brought you a project i &apos;m going to introduce you to you now .
and the title of his talk was , yes , you know , you know , a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively conceptual history , where if you could make a memory of meaning today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the ocean .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four four people living there .
now , today , renewables today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you ?
this is simply not technological .
if you &apos;re more <unk> each other , it starts to fail .
i always tell the politicians when they &apos;re going to put our facility in the <unk> .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our network is physically seen the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , figures out that was <unk> , have the first star of the island , just expect to be just .
how big as big , you have to be a battery , you &apos;re like an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i go back again a more <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this .
by the way a year , about a hundred <unk> electric achievement on the world &apos;s performance .
this is the equivalent of the power of a hundred nuclear power power power system , because this is very quickly everywhere .
the world &apos;s <unk> , which is happening , is going to be erased with petrol because you don &apos;t need permission .
this is going quickly .
you &apos;re like this box .
and then it looks like this .
in which they &apos;re always three of the <unk> , two are waited forever .
yeah , there &apos;s one thing underneath the bottom here .
we &apos;ve got very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is in rule a system of an effective system , or a system that can only be in small quantities here .
our goal was just to say , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay ,
the diesel is heating and wind , and the wind , the load the load that they can map the wider percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , not the achievement at the moment , they need to turn off the petrol .
that means , right now , you have to make sure that renewables are actually able to take over the network .
and of course , you can only do it , if you &apos;re managed to be managed by some way .
so no no no one has done on the world .
so that &apos;s in the small style , so you can use your <unk> on a little bit of a small <unk> .
people always ask me , what do you do , because they were in ?
this is happening .
but if you want to do several of these kinds of things , and they want to build a network , it &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was we wanted to get to 70 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s another rest here , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which will be very , very expensive , and it will not work that you do that from batteries .
this will be a energy energy , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know or bee , it will be it .
they would have to go on a <unk> and not just balance .
we just wanted to know what is because with a normal , <unk> battery .
how far do you get ?
and then did a whole amount of simulation .
and we have wind and sun and the load of <unk> and came to the outcome , an interesting outcome that you have to the conventional system that takes about 20 cents a <unk> , about 50 cents a <unk> , about 50 cents a <unk> .
so this was the first calculation six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay , we &apos;ve said .
so &apos;s great , then we have a model model .
we are cheaper like the <unk> , if the five percent per year goes up .
and then we started negotiating with the <unk> .
what should anything have done ?
have been talking to investors , i looked looking for new research .
we were only five people to rebuild a society again .
and here again , this shows .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a system of ours , because we &apos;re still 20 percent of petrol and also a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that &apos;s the <unk> on the island , which is what we find is really cool .
well , we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and therefore we decided to build an hall in berlin where we &apos;re sort of forming the electrical expression of the island in scale at three precisely .
this means we &apos;ve looked looking for the largest battery in the world .
here &apos;s it .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , in the trap of japan .
and it &apos;s been <unk> in the early &apos; 70s , in the world , and then had been developed and became a <unk> of japan .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a megawatts and it can bring for six hours and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re kind of <unk> .
and then they put them .
we also have one of these things that are in the same size , as it is there , in the hall , actually , the entire dynamic behavior of this network , so that &apos;s where it looks like this , right , there &apos;s the dark battery , there &apos;s the whole battery that &apos;s the current , which is the current gas interface that we have to simulate the network .
here we simulate this slide over here , we simulate the whole layer of <unk> , the cable of the cable to put the <unk> in the network .
and here you see this again .
we can also put out <unk> <unk> on the network .
here we see here again , we see the diesel again , again , all the one , individual <unk> .
and what we did was since the <unk> was then done , until today , all of the things that we &apos;ve done here between the individual system in electronics in software , we did this .
so we &apos;re not a <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s only between the subject of battery and the subject and it &apos;s about it .
you need to communicate with battery , you need to communicate on the network , and that &apos;s very complicated .
and the beauty is on the subject that you &apos;re basically all the time in this island today , all of the things that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our proportion of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how will be back right now and <unk> , <unk> , like this , for example , on the island , we &apos;ve got for example for <unk> to 30 percent , so we &apos;re <unk> the wind and the sun .
and then it &apos;s <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start to use the island to integrate it , and we can use it to use it , because it &apos;s a load .
that means if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you won &apos;t do without memory .
you can do it through n , you can use bed nets , yeah , you should do it anyway , you &apos;re going to do the stake , but you never never will never get any of your memory .
and that &apos;s like n little bit of that message .
so many people come up and look at this , because you can see what you get .
if we shut down angiogenesis , you just have this spinning mass that causes a certain smaller in the network .
and our most enterprising technology is basically just from louder quantities of big <unk> , wherever the wave around europe is about europe .
we look at this network , see the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s going to point nine hertz , we start a few <unk> , then again , a little bit of steam steam , then we get back up again .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly neat .
if you put this somewhere else , it &apos;s quite a while .
this is has clinically has has at least 10 seconds to keep the network .
and in time you can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that , this spinning mass , then you have to replace this with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can get two milliseconds two milliseconds .
there &apos;s what there &apos;s been there , which enormous amount of things there .
and the message is now , we need to get on these rotating masses , if we sort of kind of our goals of 20 , 20 , twenties percent , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent and so on if we want to achieve that .
then we need to break our most vulnerable capacity in the network .
so , <unk> is simply called the power power to keep the frequency .
yeah , this is a <unk> right now , <unk> from the <unk> because we don &apos;t have or <unk> , because that doesn &apos;t happen .
and we &apos;re simply trying to make them that you &apos;re the capacity , the capacity capacity , it can take away by taking electrochemical memory into the network .
now there are certainly a whole bunch of studies .
and to this purpose , people always come and look at our <unk> , sort of our <unk> .
and yeah , the debate always is about asking how far you can get a piece of far future .
and many discussions that i had had been similar to the debate that i had been in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
not , there &apos;s no , there &apos;s no , we &apos;ve got anything , don &apos;t solve .
we &apos;ve got 30 <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just go from that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity for the world &apos;s same capacity for the world .
just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s so a whole amount of <unk> and arguments .
and the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve been able to have this last two years that scientists ask on my page .
we &apos;ve got 10 million dollars of <unk> , too , to <unk> the german networks now .
this will happen in the next april .
so you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only about this kind of <unk> , to this idea , a hundred percent renewable true true .
and if you have 100 percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far as far as soon as soon as we &apos;re trying to do , these things , they &apos;re doing , they have a little network , which has nothing to do with our business .
and the question is just simply if you &apos;re completely independently whatsoever from some fossil or <unk> , which are anywhere in the world , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , then they &apos;re an island .
then they use it just what &apos;s on sun and wind there is where they live .
and this is something like a bit of our vision of a <unk> power force and i &apos;m thankful to be thankful that they &apos;ve said to use solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in this way , the talk about <unk> <unk> , that you can use a collective and use solar power , here &apos;s a little together .
and yeah , i want to encourage you , in the sense , you can be a little crazy and you can have some vision .
and you have to be really quite a very selfish thing , but i think that it &apos;s going .
thank you .
as steve lopez , i think , los angeles times , one day in the middle of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , african-american , <unk> , severe , homeless who had only two strings .
many of you are going to know the story , because from <unk> articles later , he became a book that was been told by robert <unk> as steve lopez and jamie <unk> as steve lopez and jamie <unk> as steve deliberately <unk> , who was the <unk> who was had a <unk> physicist early by his roommate &apos;s masterpiece .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a prison department and 30 years later he was living on the streets of <unk> row in the middle of los angeles .
i recommend reading all the book or watch the movie , so they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that was between these two men , but also how the music helped make this connection , and how they ultimately had the instrument , and how they were ultimately able to get the instrument , and then they were able to get the instrument , and then they were the tool that they were .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney <unk> hall .
he was just heard a demonstration of beethoven &apos;s first first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking about a very <unk> and <unk> note about yo-yo ma and mike clinton and about how the dodgers would never create in the baseball world , and all of the time that the first violin passage in the last sentence of beethoven passage .
we came to speak on music . and a few days later i got an email where he was interested in my interest in mine .
i must mention that nathaniel was saying a medical treatment because he was already with electricity and with <unk> and handcuffed to a trauma that has been been supported his whole life .
so as a consequence of this , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he goes away for days , in the streets of <unk> row , all the horror and the horror of his own mind .
and in exactly a way , nathaniel was nathaniel when we started with our first class in walt disney hall , started in his eyes and had lost his eyes in his eyes and worked completely lost .
he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison him in your sleep .
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid i could lose him that he could sink into one of its states and i could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to talk about scale and <unk> and other exciting forms of the <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i played , i realized that in retrospect , was a complete transformation .
it was like he was threatened by a invisible drug system , a chemical reaction , which was my game .
<unk> <unk> wrath turned into understanding , deeply curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle he took his violin , and started playing some excerpts from <unk> , and then asked me to finish it , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then started talking about music , started talking about beethoven , mumbai , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have a knowledge of music , but it also connected to her with a strong personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i just knew about my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by playing music and talked about music , confused , confused man , who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , fine , at juilliard musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means heartache .
because music allows him to be his thoughts and delusions with its imagination and creativity into something real <unk> .
and so he &apos;s his most painful condition .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
right , this is why we make music : so we &apos;re something that &apos;s in all of us , deep deep , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creativity .
and indeed , this term comes all us all , and moves , inspired and united united .
what nathaniel undertook , so he brought him back into a community of friends .
the most violent force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who recognized his talent and had it .
and i &apos;m always going to keep playing with nathaniel music , whether if in walt disney <unk> hall or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something i stole the <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i knew many fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first thing that was more like passionate about passionate .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good taste , <unk> , a book book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was bred for the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the ceo of the company was asked , whether i could be a piece of a piece of paper about sustainability .
&quot; of course i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what this unimaginable problem has become our cooks , how do we keep fish on our ? ?
we &apos;ve been the ocean for the last 50 years as we &apos;ve beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to get the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the tuna , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;ve collapsed collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so i guess or evil , <unk> , <unk> , one part of our future .
many arguments against it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , take tuna , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
this means 15 pounds of food , so you get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
not tastes very good .
so here was finally a company that tried to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
before the week before this week i called the ceo of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don &quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for being as far outside in the ocean that they don &apos;t have the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that waste is being distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he put , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> of <unk> to 1 , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> one , great .
&quot; <unk> one thing ? what feeds you ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins &quot; he said .
&quot; great &quot; i said .
and this evening i was in bed and thought , what hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , briefly before the conference , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he will ask .
now , i was talking with some people in the company . no one could give me an honest answer , until i finally put with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call it anyway .
&quot; don &quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
now he alluded some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , feathers , skin , waste , waste , waste and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much of your average is chicken ? &quot;
perhaps two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what is sustainable to feed the fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get me from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
i &apos;m even .
no , i &apos;ve actually got a <unk> of this fish because i swear to god , which was eating fish after this conversation .
this second fish , this is another kind of story .
it &apos;s romantic way , the way you do you know you know about fish , you love the fish that loves .
i had been eating him in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a <unk> reporter had been talking about this fish for long long .
it has a kind of <unk> .
he came on the table with a bright , almost mild white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
stop twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish as well as it was going to be <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t have a fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least the way you and i understand underneath .
he &apos;s a biologist in la la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s close to the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up in the , which was basically wetlands .
they did this by putting the land .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and they kept out water from the country and out out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and ecologically was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds around what &apos;s many birds for this place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company was bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have vice versa to the flow of water .
they literally have the levers .
instead of water using water , they used the canals to put the water back again .
they were throwing the canals .
they created an 11,000 acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and and then the <unk> and his company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you haven &apos;t seen something like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is <unk> channels and these density , lush march .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fought us through the wetlands and i have <unk> and <unk> , i have <unk> to my knees , and <unk> himself in quiet .
here he lifts an distinct <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here &apos;s a pattern of bundle that reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has spent the most part of his career in the early national park in africa .
i asked him how he has become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and lies in more talk of rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the most primitive community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was love .
and my head was weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i cut him . i said , &quot; hey , how does it taste that your fish as well ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the algae , phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what food eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
now , he goes forward to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish were eating what they would eat in the wild .
the liquid biomass , phytoplankton , the zoo zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever one farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
i was headed around on day on this site , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like to be like , &quot; unlike any farm i ever had was , &quot; how do you do success ? &quot;
now , right now , it was like a director would have planned a <unk> .
and we walked around the corner and we offered us the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , literally literally a pinker carpet light .
&quot; this is success , he said .
&quot; look at your favorite box , pink .
they &apos;re . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; well , don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to birds .
now last year , on this site , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private health research in europe .
i said , &quot; well , <unk> , is a good arguer doesn &apos;t the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he kept his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a self-organizing network .
the <unk> feed the shrimp .
the shrimp are affecting these phytoplankton .
je pinker the stomach better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures their success on your body .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> of the face is not even there .
they breed out 240 miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly out 240 miles .
they do this because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> .
seriously .
i introduced me a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , flies drop out 240 miles back to the farm and then take up 240 miles back at night ?
do you do this for children ? &quot;
he looked at me as i was quoted a song by whitney houston houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved animal that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , frightening taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t tasted any <unk> .
she liked sweet and sunk as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to the <unk> and he was <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense , before something in your body .
it has developed over evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he put it : &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that &apos;s measuring its success .
and then i realized when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he &apos;s enormous , because the water that comes pouring out by this farm from the river .
it &apos;s a river that causes all things with that , which is today , they tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , poisonous by <unk> .
and if it has fought by the system , and this leaves the water is clean as it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only a farm that measures their success on your own health , but a farm that literally is a <unk> , not just for those fish , but not just for you and me .
because if the water is water , it &apos;s <unk> in the atlantic .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i suppose you , and they should do it because this love story , how romantic also , as romantic , is also <unk> .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good foods whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
so what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one where actually they actually taste good .
but for many people , it &apos;s a bit radical .
we &apos;re not a <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re granny .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about regional food . we eat food .
and if you say that these are things that ensure the future of good foods is somewhere somewhere and says , &quot; hey guys , i love <unk> , but how are they feed the world ?
how are they feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than only .
one billion people are hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of volatile inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because she &apos;s going to have the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
feed crops , <unk> , <unk> , chemicals on earth , chicken on fish , and all the time has said , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people cheaper , how bad can that be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the easy thing . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what she &apos;s , an craft in <unk> , an craft that makes fast <unk> capital that allows this production .
this isn &apos;t craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our main system is threatened today not because of the <unk> , but because of more resources , it &apos;s resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile land , not through water , it doesn &apos;t through <unk> water , not through <unk> , but not through forests , not through <unk> and not by fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that provide every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in it , and it has never made something really good for food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the green model .
this is this that &apos;s been on two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses that are not worlds , businesses , which reconnect to another approach , businesses , businesses , instead of curing intense farmers , farmers who aren &apos;t just messed , but experts for relationships .
because they are those who are experts experts .
and if i really &apos;m honest , you are a better chef than i ever will .
you know , this is right , because if that &apos;s good food , it &apos;s being delicious .
thank you .
if i want to show you one thing today is that the total of the data we consume , greater than the sum of your parts and instead of thinking about the data of the information , i think they can think about how we can use information that they could be able to think of patterns and identify that trends that couldn &apos;t be visible .
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after one particular cause of death , they say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of the most active , they are most active , and they &apos;re over here .
we can move out one step and then push the data and see that data and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now if we go on and take off after age , we say 40 years or younger , we see accidents are the main source of the most important about people should be concerned .
and who &apos;s shown that this is true especially among men .
so you see that this is what you see is the point of information and data in this way in a vibrant state of living .
and if we can do this for raw data why not even do content ?
now what we &apos;ve here is the <unk> of every single &quot; sport &apos;s &quot; ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can actually test it after my talk .
with <unk> , you can dive into a decade .
they can dive dive in one particular year .
you can jump directly to a specific copy .
now , when i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , i click there , so i &apos;ll show all of my spending about my worries .
now , if i just want to get a sanitary pad overview , i could think &quot; ok , what if i look at anything with the subject ? &quot;
so i go back step back and push the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you look at this kind of information , we &apos;re going to be able to do it , wider , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , then you don &apos;t just want or not just not just .
you make something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between between and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
i want to do this idea now a little bit about something like something crazy .
what we did here is we &apos;ve taken every single sample of them and reduce it up to a little summary .
the summary is a short view and a symbol of the area that comes from .
i just show the top 500 500 of the famous ones .
but even in this finite view , we can do lots of things .
so immediately we get a glimpse of the topics that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to vote for &apos; government .
now after i elected government , i realize that the <unk> that are most concerned about this time , &quot; people &apos;s &quot;
this is really important because this is a knowledge that isn &apos;t in a single <unk> .
this is just to recognize that if you go back and look at this .
suppose , quote , one of these six-word summary , i can put back in time , &quot; people of the year &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that most of them are <unk> , some come from science . some , even less , come from economics . here &apos;s my boss . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump on all the ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re looking at the first time as if it &apos;s really a network , not just side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what one might show you what a little surprise could be .
i just show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not browser , but you can look at websites that -- and we bring these kinds of things to every single website like this .
so i can go back one step , and just take a specific bit of <unk> .
so that &apos;s because you &apos;re just looking at looking at websites in this way , and look at the same way that we can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a certain time .
here &apos;s the story of the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve given over to over .
and i can do anything i looked at today , again , again .
and if i go back to a step and look on everything , i can start my course , maybe i &apos;m going to launch my course , i &apos;m looking for the <unk> , i looked look for lightning , here after bing labs .
and from here i can go into the side and go back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that has used again , and every time it makes the big big big than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of the curse .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could switch this situation and put the internet on your head , so that we instead of walking from one another , start to get lots of things to lots of things , and that allows patterns that would be hidden hidden hidden ?
if we can do this , then these previous record , maybe a new source of information is information .
and instead of moving into information , we can get out of it .
and if we know , we can even pull out of it .
i &apos;m going to stand up with thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
i went to school with the bus , every day an hour per track .
and my nose was always stuck in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts in different worlds and in a very depressing way my deep , respectful curiosity .
so this curiosity turned out that i always was when i was not in school , walking through the forests , walked and &quot; samples &quot; and found out and found out samples and snakes and bugs , all brought home and looked underneath the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always trying to understand the world and explore the limitations of possible .
and my love science fiction seemed seemed to reflect in my environment , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the sea .
jacques cousteau came into his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder that we &apos;ve never had ever imagined .
it &apos;s probably very good at the <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since it didn &apos;t get a video games with these <unk> films with the whole pictures of the media media , i had to create the pictures in my head .
we had to all all . if we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the screen .
my response to this was drawing and painting by aliens , aliens worlds , robots , <unk> and all this stuff .
i was constantly caught from the teachers , like i hid in hidden textbook .
and all of creativity had had to be out .
and something interesting happened here . what fascinated me with jacques <unk> shows was the thought of one unknown world here on earth .
certainly i would never ever ever ever thought a alien world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually walk on , here on earth , and she was equally fascinating and exotic as all that i &apos;ve imagined i had thought i had read these books .
so i decided i was 15 to get scuba divers .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 3,000 miles from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me do it .
i went to my dad until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , found on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my favorite village in a pool of the <unk> in the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , but a real ocean , i got two years later to face when we moved to california .
since then , in 40 years , which are now <unk> , i &apos;ve spent about three-pound hours under water , 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of sea , even in the ocean oceans , as rich in life , as rich as we can really barely imagine .
nature nature doesn &apos;t know limits , unlike our own , cross-cultural human imagination .
we &apos;ve got lowest awe for today &apos;s last days .
and my love holds the ocean , with the same intensity as usual .
and then when i was an adult job , it was the filmmaking .
this seemed the best opportunity , my inner drive , to tell stories , with my need to meet pictures .
as a kid i drew books and like this .
so films were gone to come together pictures and stories . this fits together .
of course , stories i &apos;m out of , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens &quot; &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i could do my predilection for the <unk> and the diving into the filmmaking .
so , sort of my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we attacked the <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what came out of this was the first <unk> <unk> that ever had ever seen in a film .
so the film didn &apos;t have any money , right , he was playing a kind of function , but i realized something fascinating : the audience around the world was like <unk> from the magic , who went from it .
according to arthur clarke are law of law , you know , <unk> technology and magic no longer .
so you saw something magic .
and i found this fascinating fascinating .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must necessarily be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went into &quot; terminator 2 &quot; , my next film , still much further .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal , and success was quite focused on how this effect would arrive .
and it worked . again , we had created something magic , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we &apos;ve got a little more money on this film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company with my good friend stan , who was the best <unk> and <unk> was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
the basic idea of this company was that that was to push the phase analog processes with visual printers etc . and start with digital <unk> .
we then did and did it for a strategy for a while .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- which we had created the company , really slowly , slowly .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar &quot; written the bar on some visual effects and <unk> effects in new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that were made by <unk> , and the <unk> should be done by <unk> . and the <unk> should be <unk> .
but the bar put quite back up , and the people in my company told me that we were not able to be able to do that .
so i shifted this and made this other film over the big ship , going down .
i &apos;ve got this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship &quot; and it became a <unk> of magnitude , a passionate film .
but i was really trying to be the real closed of titanic .
so i did this film .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i &apos;ve convinced them , i said , &quot; we dip to the train . we film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the video of the film .
this is tremendously important . it &apos;s a good thing for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to finance an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is going back to that your own imagination can create reality .
we then created a reality six months later , where i &apos;m going to put in a russian russian <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a <unk> .
this wasn &apos;t movie , no movie movie was really .
so , this really blew me out .
and the preparation were enormous . we had to build cameras and headlight and all kinds of things .
and i fell on , like very similar , a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> more sophisticated planning .
you go into this capsule , you &apos;re floating into this dark , opaque environment where no hope is saving if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like i was in a <unk> .
this is really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed obsessed with exploring the sea .
anyway , anyway , that &apos;s curiosity and science , it was something . it was adventures , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine myself a creature , we could then create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the computer .
and i saw some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i never saw before , sometimes things that had ever seen before and for the science at the moment , when we saw them , even no words .
so this was really confused me , and i wanted to more .
and so i found a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to be my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood and will take a while . &quot;
and then we started , we showed up to the <unk> , and they were exploring .
we went back to the closed of the titanic .
we took small robots that we built , which is a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and looking at the insides of the ship , which had never been done before .
no no no one had sampled the inner burden . you had no tools for it . so we developed the technology .
and i &apos;m sitting there on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see the <unk> that &apos;s pretty similar here and i know that once had played the tape there .
and i fly through a little bit of the road through the viking ship .
i &apos;m just just but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the titanic of titanic .
this was the most harrowing form of a <unk> i ever experienced , because before i took a corner of a corner , i &apos;ve always knew what was going on in the <unk> of the vehicle , since i was going on the movie .
because the set was really a very copy of the design of the ship .
so this was an extremely curious experience .
she made me aware that you could be aware of this <unk> , that you can use such a <unk> , and so your own conscious conscious shape in the vehicle , that different form of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little bit of a little bit of a glimpse of what might happen in some decades , if you have been able to explore something or explore other things , in all kinds of things that i could do as a specialist .
after this expeditions we started what we saw down down here , really appreciate this , for example , these <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with the help of <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight , as we do that .
and this is what you see , they &apos;re going right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was interested in <unk> , which was back from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and and they have to do with nasa and in the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to go right . they drive down russia , through the mission that would be supported by the international protocol and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but then it was on the end that i took out of the deep deep sea .
i took them with and put them together to the world down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the sources , and we could use tools and test tools and so on .
we were sitting sitting , but he was doing science , actually , more specifically , <unk> .
so , the circle between my existence as a child , and the <unk> , and actually the reality .
i learned a lot over this voyage of discovery .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking you now , a director must have to lead a director , a leader like a leader like a <unk> or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i have this expeditions .
because at one particular point i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what does it happen ? &quot;
these <unk> films don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re just playing the costs . of fame doesn &apos;t trace .
all think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; if i would have a coat on one towel on one towel .
i &apos;ve all made these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you do it about the task , to the challenge of will -- and the ocean is the most important environment that there are . you make it the <unk> of the , because because of the weird connection that emerges when a small group of people are doing a team .
because we &apos;ve done all of this with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , sometimes we were two or three months row on sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have before each other , because you have overcome a job that you can tell no other different .
if you go back to land and says , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and all around the way , all around the technology , and the trouble that you can do with police , and that &apos;s like no one can do it .
there &apos;s a connection that creates a connection , each other .
so when i came back to try my next film &quot; avatar , i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you volunteered his team and earns himself .
so the dynamic was transformed .
so i stood again with a small team on the very long terrain , we turned &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
tremendously exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were a half four years of a four four years .
so my way my way my way my way to make films completely .
there were people who thought we were really able to do this <unk> really well , and put on the planet .
for me , it was more a more inclusive way , my job , to do the actual process that has changed in the outcome .
so what can we conclude from all of that ?
what lessons are we learned ?
i think first is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that even can even create reality .
and the alarm gets more important than all the <unk> in this world .
i come to me young filmmakers who say : &quot; give me advice about how i could do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t even get yourself .
and you get it on you . don &apos;t you don &apos;t get yourself , betting on yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has one of the <unk> : &quot; fail is not alternative . &quot;
but in art and studying failure must fail , because there &apos;s certainly a <unk> .
no important endeavor that demanded innovation was ever addressed .
you need to be ready to take risks that risks .
this is the thought i want to show you with a path . fail is an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i talk to you about energy and climate .
and maybe this surprising thing that i think my favorite group in the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seed , to make the things that we invent and deliver to provide the poorest two billion lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually even more important than every other on the planet .
so , <unk> means that their investment care are not growing over many years , we &apos;re too much or too much rain ; things are going to change as it can &apos;t withstand their fragile environment .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , you will be a climate change for you .
and also , the key source is very important for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce one thing about one thing , the energy costs would be about far at the most effective .
well , the <unk> is over time .
actually , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> was pushed the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and so we &apos;ve got refrigerators around refrigerators , air air , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price in half -- we &apos;re going to a new barrier and this barrier depended on co2 .
co2 warms up planets and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they &apos;re <unk> the co2 co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and these <unk> has some very negative consequences of effects on the weather , and then the effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the tiniest rate that the natural ecosystems cannot adapt and collapse of all the systems .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and which is about <unk> and where they are going on , there are some questions , but not lots of questions .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to follow . but they &apos;re extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the most few times before : &quot; do we really have to get down to zero ?
isn &apos;t half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we come close to zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than say , we have a 3.5 feet of truck that has to be under a three feet bridge , and then you can put it underneath underneath .
this is going to be down to zero .
now , we dip every year from a mile from miles away .
every americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
average , it &apos;s about five tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we need to create change that lower it down to zero .
it has gone up far .
only different economic changes have affected at all , and we need to go from increasing increase in reducing and reducing it to zero .
this equation has four factors : a bit bit multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to bring to zero , and that &apos;s going to be dependent upon the numbers of people , the average energy for every service , the average energy of energy consumption .
so let &apos;s look at every factor of each other , and think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through .
first we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it &apos;s going on 9 billion <unk> , which is going on 9 billion .
if we could be very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and engineering system , we could reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but at time we see a slope about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this includes all that we eat , clothing , water , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> means that they &apos;re almost available to each other on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could use <unk> and less use , but average , it will increase each year every year and so much more than double that number of services per person .
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s light to you can read your homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , efficiency , the e , energy per service , there &apos;s good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the field of climate change , through other ways , through new ways , there are many services , their amounts of services , they have its amounts of services to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , like redesigning <unk> , 105 degrees : <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , the energy system , is much smaller .
all of that , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction by three or maybe to be a factor six or maybe .
but for the first three factors , we are now from 26 billion tons of tons , and it &apos;s just not enough !
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be a unit of energy .
it turns out that you can get to zero .
if they burn coal : no .
if you burn gas gas : no .
almost every oxygen system for electricity today today is co2 , except renewables .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now if i use miracles &quot; wonder , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
so people here have contributed to developing many of these miracles .
normally there isn &apos;t deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
normally you &apos;re just wrong and some come , others don &apos;t .
but in this case we have to be able to get a miracle of a very short moment .
well , i asked myself , how could i get this up ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that has led to the idea of people here ?
i remembered this last year when i took mosquitoes and somehow people loved this .
and the idea was really useful for them , you know that there are people who live with mosquito .
for energy , i got this one .
i decided that this was my <unk> involved in the environment to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you were assured me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of things like these , but they don &apos;t get lots of .
we need solutions , either one or several of those are available to have some unimaginable scale and unimaginable government , and although there are many directions where people are searching for that , i really see five that can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve got tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
these may be a <unk> contribution , and if you do better than i expect to expect , this is cool , but my punch line here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give them because they &apos;re not a significant problem .
let &apos;s first look at the end fossil fuels , burning fossil gas or gas gas .
what you need to do there may seem like , but it &apos;s not . you should have all the co2 that comes from burning from the heat bar , capture , underneath pressure , and hoping that there &apos;s air .
there are some <unk> that are going on 60 percent -- 80 percent of the level , but it &apos;s going to be 100 percent , but it &apos;s going to be a very difficult thing to do it is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make it secure ?
who can guarantee something that literally is better than any kind of junk that you can imagine about <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough problem .
next : <unk> .
it has three big problems . the cost , especially in more inclusive countries , and the question is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human cooperation , that oil isn &apos;t used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble , and you should work on .
the last three of five pairs i &apos;ve summarized .
it &apos;s renewables as they &apos;re called a lot .
and also -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the density density that are creating these technologies are dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many of them , 1,000 times more than a normal power plant .
also , these sources are on .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and we don &apos;t even fly the wind all all day .
so you have to be able to depend on these sources , you have a path that energy is not available in times if they &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big <unk> here . there are challenges with transmission , if we say that the source source source of the country is beyond the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they need to be able to do that the energy of where different comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all sorts of batteries that are produced , looking for cars , computers , mobile phones , <unk> , for everything . and i found that all of the batteries that we use , less than 10 minutes of the <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be 100 better than the approaches time .
this isn &apos;t impossible , but it isn &apos;t so easy .
this happens when you try to get these more expensive sources , we &apos;re going 20 percent of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest .
if you want to support 100 percent on it , they need an incredible amount of <unk> .
now , where shall we go : what is the right approach ?
one &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how are we going to target ?
what we need are many companies who work on this . hundreds .
so within each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
you &apos;re going to say you &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s many people here in ted group , there .
bill has several companies , among other companies , has got a great <unk> company .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies doing great things and i have interesting opportunities and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company that may be , perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; it &apos;s <unk> , liquid .
so , the development has stopped in this industry sometime , so it &apos;s not a surprise that some good concepts around around .
so the key thing is that instead of an inch instead of a part of the car , which is one percent , we decided to burn 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but actually , you &apos;ve thought about this long , but you could never have to simulate reasonable whether it would work , but since it &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that : yeah ! with the right line , it looks like that .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s much better .
actually , you burn the waste , and you can even use waste of today &apos;s reactors as a solar system .
instead of breaking it down , you burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
so uranium &apos;s going to use this , a bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of plank , often as &quot; walking wave &quot; called reactor .
this really solve the problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
the u.s. spends hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re cheap and easy to do , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s lots of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to get forward forward .
think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to do and then we talk about the <unk> .
many people are talking about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest 20 percent are produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture . hopefully it &apos;s going to be clean and cement and it &apos;s clean .
so to get this 80 percent , we need to change the industrialized countries , including countries like china , completely changing .
the other note says whether we use the <unk> technology whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the path to get them to the rest .
this is great .
this is a key feature element .
if we go back from there , how should 2020 report ?
it should have some both elements .
we should use the <unk> to get reducing reducing reduction . the less we have a smaller , the lower ones that are going to be lower and the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things we do , which don &apos;t fully lead to the big <unk> , just the same , or even slightly less important than the other which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
so these breakthroughs have to follow with <unk> , and we can measure that : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are lots of great books on this subject .
al gore book &quot; we have choice &quot; and david <unk> &quot; <unk> water <unk> hot water . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this can be discussed wide , because we need support support for all sides .
there &apos;s some things that have to come together .
this is a wish .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love this wish , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , which is , <unk> , <unk> .
this has the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , it will be trapped between the long and short in the short term , and in the most short time , people are being terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of these lives are going to be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more research research .
if countries meet in places like the <unk> , they should not only talk about co2 .
you should talk about these <unk> , and they were shocked by the silly low money that are for these innovative approaches .
we need carbon dioxide , co2 taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade technologies creates something that is a state of power .
we need to spread the message .
we need to lead to dialogue and complete and the things that are done by the government .
it &apos;s a critical wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , you can you give us an idea of order to this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all big scientists , we &apos;ve done only some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to ensure that it &apos;s actually actually in the <unk> of the , you &apos;re just in the <unk> .
the difficult step is building the first <unk> to find another billion , the <unk> and the place of actually building the first one .
once the first thing happened when it &apos;s going to be like i promised , it &apos;s all clear because the average density , the density density is so different than we know them .
to understand this right : that means deep deep into the ground , almost like a vertical column of nuclear dioxide , that use this pressure , and then starts the process up and works on top ?
<unk> : right . today you have to put the reactor out , so there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and open things out of it , and it &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can think about 60 years -- think of a column -- you &apos;ll be buried without the entire complexities .
and there &apos;s sitting there and burn 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which offers a solution for the trash .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the trash : you can sit it -- there &apos;s lots of crap with this method -- then take it up and put it into the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start by taking the waste , which has already exists in these <unk> or <unk> in these reactors . this is our <unk> .
so what these reactors is a problem , which we do in our fill in our fill , and it will dramatically reduce the economic rate during this process .
but while they &apos;ve talked about different people in this world .
where is the greatest interest , what really do ?
<unk> : well we haven &apos;t set us up on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for anything that &apos;s called nuclear &quot; nuclear &quot; on behalf , there &apos;s big interest and the people of the company was in russia , india , china -- i was talking about how this was going to be the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something into the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was done .
this is a big step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , so everyone who has done a quick reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your idea : timeline and chance to make something really better life ?
so , <unk> : well we need one of these things , <unk> things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent 20 years .
this is basically the deadline that gave us the most exciting thing that we need to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything &apos;s good , and this is a big wish , could keep it easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of things , and they work , if they work , work for how to promote for your pilots , could be able to do it .
and it would be best if there are several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
but given to the great breakthroughs , is this the biggest you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important .
this would have been without the <unk> , but it &apos;s also more important .
there are other innovative companies in the nuclear sector .
you know , we know their work doesn &apos;t as well as these , but there are the modular method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems something hard , but maybe they say that &apos;s about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing is that a million times that a million times has a lot of energy has a lot of energy as a , say , a <unk> , and therefore if you can do with the issues , they are mostly the radiation , which is essentially the infrastructure , which is essentially the impact , which is the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact
if that doesn &apos;t work what ?
do we have to initiate a <unk> to do that to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you get too much better , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve got too much better , and soon before a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or similar .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> that is called a different techniques to delay warming , so we should be 20 or 30 years longer .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you should not get to work at the insurance , because you might be good , so you &apos;re eating , because you know that one is going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know whether that smart is if you make the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in whether you should have this , if things come faster , or this innovation need longer , or this innovation need longer than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences for you to do ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are in very different camp .
those who do arguments are very little .
do you say that negative effects is going to do with the clouds , moving things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell you , which there is a chance in a million .
this is like this is like this like aids .
you make mistakes now , and you pay lots of it .
and so the idea , now , if you have all kinds of problems of doing anything that you have just like to do , you know , it &apos;s just going to be -- and then comes that investment isn &apos;t necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world that are not necessarily the worst scenario .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry about .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and the co2 , then the co2 , then say the skeptics , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it , because it &apos;s cheaper to be that it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and this would be their answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve co2 problem , all the other things that are affecting the other things that are affecting malaria , that we can do it for the power of malaria , and so on that there &apos;s better things that we can do .
<unk> : now , the actual amount of research -- say that u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
there should not suffer with other things .
you get too big <unk> , and here you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to finance that . for me , most of you .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short of a <unk> and just funded to learn , i think we should try to try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the <unk> you get , a very high school , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without your life .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks about .
his new <unk> is now : &quot; why will research not talk about ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and therefore he &apos;s bringing the <unk> .
and this is a press i think for appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it will be supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all people here , if i say , i really hope you wish your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
some years ago at ted , peter <unk> hired a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> &quot; .
and the idea is fairly easy . <unk> has to have to make the highest highest structure of structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about meter tape , called a meter of paper and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , although it seems really easy , it &apos;s really hard to work because it &apos;s asking people to work quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea and i turned it into a <unk> system .
it was a huge success .
since then i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops worldwide , with students , engineers and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there &apos;s something on this job , which enabled deep sensations in nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you .
usually most people are starting to orient themselves .
they talk about it , what it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s <unk> .
then they invest a little bit in planning and organization . they draw and put spaghetti .
they invest a bulk of their time in the <unk> of the world .
and finally , soon before they don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and they put it gently on the top , step back and go back and &quot; <unk> ! admire their work .
but then almost always , it &apos;s happening , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be because the weight of the dopamine causes that all the things bend and <unk> .
there &apos;s a bunch of people who have much more &quot; <unk> , &quot; and most of the worst , are fresh fresh .
they lie , they &apos;re overwhelmed and they really produce <unk> shapes .
and of course there are teams that have lots more <unk> , and they are fresh fresh new students &apos; pearl care .
and this is quite amazing .
like peter told us they don &apos;t only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does this happen ? why ? what is ?
and peter tells me : &quot; none of children spend time to be the boss of spaghetti .
they don &apos;t invest in the <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that <unk> were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then it then figures it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s done is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , so they have a time to fix the prototype .
<unk> recognizes this kind of collaboration as a core of a <unk> .
and with every trial , the children get immediate feedback , what works and not .
so the achievement is working with prototypes , but we see how different teams act .
average average for most of them is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers , but not much , more knowledgeable than adults .
who &apos;s at the most successful ?
architects and engineers , happiness .
meter is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and highly geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceos are about average , but here &apos;s interesting .
you put an administrator administrator administrator in the team , they will better better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see it and recognize &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why does this happen ?
because they have special skills of the .
they conduct the process , you understand it .
and this team that would regulate , and look at work , the power of teams will improve the power of teams .
specialized skills and <unk> and their combination of success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , they have robust structures .
i tried something exciting .
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the <unk> .
so i offered a $ $ $ $ prize prize for the winner .
what did she think happened with this ?
what was the outcome ?
this was happening here . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone built a hot construction , he would have carried the price at home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high rates of high levels have strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
what did you think ?
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so , from the same , bad team one of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest .
so there are more important lessons for us , about nature of inspiration and success .
you may ask : why would somebody actually invest a child ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> is doing , they help them hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
the challenge challenge is a shared experience , a common language or ethos , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can visit the <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a solar system there .
they find crazy examples from all the world like people optimize the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the most primitive lesson , i think , is actually a sport &apos;s exercise .
it requires that we all set up our senses , and we think we &apos;re thinking our thinking optimal , how our emotions and our do our own , in the challenge that lies .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it needs to bring us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and this can make a difference .
thank you .
so we have this machine as we would have a machine .
one big machine , a cool machine , and this is a machine machine machine .
and everyone in this room has to put in this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stand in here and right now .
and i ask what you would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends for recently this question , and they wanted to go all the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back back before there were cars or twitter or america is looking at american . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you kind of attracted to the <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i must say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and not because i &apos;m a adventurers .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that ever had on this planet , whatever scale you do : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining .
there was never been a time like this .
my family addicts died all died .
my grandparents urged this numbers on <unk> .
my parents are 80 on the <unk> .
so there should be better one nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a kid who &apos;s born today in new delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox : smallpox has billions of people killed on this planet .
they &apos;ve made the demographics of earth in a way as no war ever done .
they are gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve got them <unk> .
in the rich world there are diseases that have millions of us only under one generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anyone knows even what that is ?
vaccines modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is trying to try things out , if it works , it &apos;s changing if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievement of humanity .
so this is good news .
unfortunately , this is all good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and they were often mentioned , we &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , there &apos;s a billion people on this world every day .
this numbers goes up , and it goes very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash this world .
drinking water , tropical land , oil , oil , gas : they disappear , and soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos we &apos;re not going to disappear from this chaos .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t even collapse .
i really believe that , and no , no one is not a <unk> .
but this is holding me night -- one of the things that hold me night , we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress yet as well as now , yet , never even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even , even ,
and we were still able to do it , even as we can do it today .
we are at amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we &apos;ve got hundreds of years ago , 300 years before the enlightenment would have to go back to find a time where we have to fight progress , where we have on these things .
people are clinging to their belief , and so tightly that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth is going to free it .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion , even a fairly rightly true for its progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have quite much on their own facts . &apos; &apos; &apos; s not .
and i took a while to figure out this .
i &apos;ve written an article about immunization for about a decade ago , &quot; new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed at resistance , against resistance , against what &apos;s most effective health organization in history .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did whatever i did , i wrote an article and drove fort .
and soon i wrote an article about genetically modified foods .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were crazy .
so i wrote a article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> &quot; why they thought that molecules was a certain kind of diagnostic system in the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
we &apos;re typing , we &apos;re going to go , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and i found it out .
and this is because these fanatics who were crazy all were no fanatics who were crazy at all .
these were well-meaning people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and this was me mess together ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face .
we are at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as usual .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about it , with little quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what reason are .
we have trust that in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that should not be like this .
you can just call some names and you &apos;ll understand people .
chernobyl , chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the south 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can vote your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who thought they were right . be like they were skeptical .
ask questions , desire evidence , desire evidence .
don &apos;t take anything .
but now comes it : if you get evidence evidence , you &apos;re going to think that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i haven &apos;t seen you and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that would be the <unk> with the measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
hundreds of studies were done to see whether that was true .
hundreds of studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came into .
the data came into from america from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we think we think what we see , what we think we think we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents of a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but do you know what ?
the result of this was disaster .
disaster in this fact : america is one of the only countries in the world where they &apos;re going to drop for measles .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is that we could do this .
well , i understand that . i do .
because anybody got measles ?
has one in the audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
not quite often happens .
but in this country , not happening at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
they are many deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
but because this isn &apos;t here , we can do it , and people like jenny can walk around and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and washington king live in the world &apos;s &quot;
and they can do it because they don &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same .
and this is something that we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he &apos;s got us from one of the worst human history .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , white , disappeared .
the guy in the middle isn &apos;t so much .
it &apos;s paul <unk> .
he has just developed a few other people with a <unk> .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children every year in developing countries .
pretty good , not ?
now , this is good except that paul runs around and talk about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people simply should stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul &apos;s in a public state , he cannot tell without armed sentinels .
he gets calls calls back home because people like to tell him that they know where your children go to school .
and why ? because paul has done a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them forward , return to the diseases , terrible disease , and this is happening right now .
we have measles in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , children are dying again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they won &apos;t get measles to measles .
what is with <unk> ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a friend of mine wrote me a few weeks ago , and i said she i &apos;m saying i &apos;m a bit of a bit .
no one has ever said before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate your child against suicide bombers . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have any maintenance services . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s someone in lagos tomorrow , and flying on a plane , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and it ends up a car , and it goes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of this <unk> night .
and he doesn &apos;t know that it &apos;s infected with a malignant disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t you do it as if it isn &apos;t .
we love to say we &apos;re in lying . we love this .
did you take all of your vitamins tomorrow ?
<unk> , a little bit of <unk> that helps you to push .
i know they &apos;ve done this because half of americans do this every day .
they take this stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find that they are futile .
the data takes this all the time .
they make their urine . more they almost never do .
this is okay , you want 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree to you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the industry industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t trust any system .
and we should not . our health care is arthritis .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely beautiful and <unk> self to us that can afford .
so we run away , and where run we run ?
we run the arms of the <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really serious matter because this stuff is crap , and we &apos;re going billions of dollars .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of trick here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars out of it .
and you know what ? when i say that , people say me and say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do people what they want .
they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the <unk> , says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to be going to be the evidence of my experts in my experts or or any cochlear analysis that wants to treat his patients with your patients .
if you &apos;re going on this path where believe and magic evidence and science replacing science , you get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people around it because he was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , much effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can definitely lower the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of deaths deaths per country that will be worse than any other of this disease .
please don &apos;t please please say that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the most vulnerable epidemic in which we &apos;re right right , this absurd struggle between the <unk> genetically engineered food and the <unk> .
this is a tough debate . she has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every branch of the , was changing by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 300 years .
and some of it has worked and some few of them .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more specifically . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions people , millions of people to extend their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do it ?
i need to say i don &apos;t understand .
we rebel changed food .
why do we do this ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing all all all all all the time : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , we don &apos;t want to have enormous fields with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is all about ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of pollen , but this isn &apos;t science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid of a whole end , and it &apos;s been millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we will have to grow 70 percent more food than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . shameful .
they need this , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? re-engineering food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of junk , like cassava cassava .
cassava is something that eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s about like an potato .
it &apos;s just one bunch calories . it &apos;s mies .
it has no nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all this right in it .
and then people could be eating the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
this would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , ask us , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to have genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it isn &apos;t about our ridiculous passion , our insist on greater food , better food , unprecedented food .
it &apos;s not about rice , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so far as far as we do we &apos;re guilty about something that we think we don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we need to stop that .
so after this incredible illustration , you want to say , &quot; do you always want to do this ridiculous machine machine and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want to do this anyway .
right now , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can ask this machine machine on all of what we want .
we can do them where we want to do them , and we &apos;ll move them where we want .
we need to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go up in your time machine machine and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy that made .
i know we can do it , and as far as it is to me , this is what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> . it may seem strange that a magician interests in it , because you look at it like me as &quot; a deception that will be a bit more likely if somebody was inadequate enough . &quot;
in other words , <unk> studies in some studies have shown an measurable effect , the <unk> , and because that person thinks what happens to you , it &apos;s a <unk> or a kind of ... in the body , for example , there &apos;s a corresponding effect in the body called the <unk> .
a deception is going to be a real true because somebody feels like it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple trick trick .
and i &apos;ll show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least for the 1950s in every single business for children .
i myself gave him out from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
so , you see what happens .
the knives that you can investigate ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knives in my hand .
i push my sleeve back .
and to ensure that nothing disappears or from him , i &apos;m just going my wrist right here .
so you can see that way you can see anything that &apos;s going to be a bit of anything , and so long as i &apos;m going to do this , nothing can go into my sleeve or get out .
and the goal is just easy .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything &apos;s done , the knife will be able to touch your naked physical light .
it &apos;s actually sitting in his place that i can shake it without that the knives .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , no <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often have little kids that are interested in magic , because you can learn lots of deception when you look closer , although it &apos;s a very simple thing that i &apos;m going to do .
probably many of you here &apos;s this trick here .
it works like this .
i &apos;m holding the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m my wrist , to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or coming out , and this is a lie .
the reason i &apos;m doing my wrist , is that that &apos;s the actual secret of deception .
because , right now , where i &apos;m going to take my hand from you , you see it from back , this finger moves here , my favorite , just from there where he was , where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting behind the back of the childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and when i &apos;m going to do , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that down here just three fingers here , because the understood and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t matter , one , two , one , two , one , two , one , one , two , one , one , two , one , one , two , one , one , two , one , one , two , one , one , two , one , one , two , one , one , two
but that &apos;s not about this right now . and then i open my hand .
of course it will be able to pass there , but not through my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing is going to be hidden by this movement that the fingers is going back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick you can demonstrate your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what has this done with the <unk> ?
a year ago , or like this , i read a study that really has my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
so it turns out , it turns out : if you put a placebo placebo placebo placebo placebo , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has given some measurable effect .
but if you &apos;re the shape where you can put on placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and color that blue is color and shape a letter , it &apos;s actually measurable effective .
and that , although none of any <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill isn &apos;t as good as a blue pill .
what ? i really crazy me .
but it turned out that that &apos;s not anything .
if you take capsules capsules that is more effective than every every form .
a colored capsule that &apos;s yellow at one end and yellow , is better than a white capsule .
also the dosage plays a role .
a pill twice daily , not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but this is the key thing .
... that the <unk> play is a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you need to reach your needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a pair of <unk> substance that you inject a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in mind . that &apos;s very much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really ... i &apos;ll show you another time if we have a projection .
so fact , the white ball doesn &apos;t seem as much as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem like the needle as well as the needle .
and none of it has some really profound property , it &apos;s only our belief that we &apos;ve achieved in a stronger effect .
i wanted to know whether i could use this idea for a trick trick .
i suppose something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let &apos;s look look really .
we know that study that you have to reach to your needle if it should go to this .
this is a 18 inches of <unk> . she &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;ll first think you a little bit of this .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not special special meat meat .
this is my skin . this is not an effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and drive through it until she &apos;s his back on the other side .
if you &apos;re bad , if you pass light down -- i demonstrated this some night in the room room last night and some people i didn &apos;t know , and she has become almost powerless .
so i &apos;m suggesting if you &apos;re quick , you look at the next 30 seconds . or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it right , you can see it , you can do it , if you want .
so , it &apos;s going on , right here , where my meat starts , close to my arm , i just will just make a little bit of <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it crazy ?
and just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we are actually in the same situation that we had on the <unk> .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , or ?
so i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah , yeah .
i know what people think if you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> your skin , just to talk about us for a few minutes . &quot;
now , i &apos;ll show you .
how does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people are coming in the <unk> right now .
let me show you close to you .
this is really my skin . this is not an effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can do this .
sorry . if you &apos;re evil , look away , don &apos;t look .
people back back or the ones that later see this later on video , they &apos;ll say , &quot; well , this looks fairly impressive , but if it was real , it would be a hole and there , you &apos;ll bleed out , &quot; well , this looks fairly impressive , but if it was real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me take a little blood for you .
yeah , here &apos;s .
i normally take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are not wounds .
but i think in this framework here and with the intention of making a difference from a deception , i will just let the needle go inside and go from the stage .
we are going to meet some few days in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re happy to it . thank you .
everyone today talks about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people counting the numbers of books that were published with happiness in the last five years , and they gave them up to about 40 , and there was plenty more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s lots of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these flood of work , there are several cognitive falling , which they &apos;re almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive fall .
this is true for the <unk> that are about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think happiness , because it turns out that we are exactly mess as a mess .
the first one of these fall is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that word happiness simply doesn &apos;t really useful word anymore because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just narrow it , but in large and whole , this is something that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated perspective on what is well-being .
the second trap is an expression of experience and memory : basically you are among happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we cannot think about a situation , well-being , well-being without accessing its meaning .
i mean , this is an actual cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> one of my lectures , who was a story , &quot; unclear ... &#93; he said he had had a symphony , and it was perfectly beautiful music , and it was perfectly beautiful music .
and then he added , really emotionally , really emotionally , it &apos;s totally ruined .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it was ruined was the memories of experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
they don &apos;t count because he was a memory of a memory ; that was memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had gotten .
what that really tells us is that we could think about us and thinking about other people in mind in terms of two ways .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in present and knows the present , is capable of experiencing the past , but essentially the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , which is the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i put it out here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that that &apos;s going to be a <unk> and the history of our lives , and it &apos;s one that &apos;s going to be the doctor , &quot; how did you feel about time ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like this .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re actually part of the <unk> of the happiness &apos;s disease .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and this starts really with a basic response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we make us stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep in our experiences .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who perform a painful operation .
i &apos;m not going to go into detail . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds on your pain .
and here are two patients . these are their writings .
and they &apos;re asked : &quot; who &apos;s got more suffered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain that patients had had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought these patients were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient had a much worse health maintenance response to the patient for a patient b.
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very critical part of history is to end .
and none of these stories is very flexible or great -- but one of them is clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the ones that was worse , which was where the pain was at the end of his peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
where do we know that ?
because we &apos;ve asked these people after their <unk> , and then much later , &quot; how bad was all this thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the point of view , b has clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we &apos;ve done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s done , and it works , you could actually push the diagnostic system to push the patient &apos;s body without just to shake it with a very much .
this will lead that the patient is suffering , but just a bit less than before .
and if you have this for a few minutes , you have causing the treatment of your patient &apos;s own , and you have causing the <unk> self to be much better on the patient , because now you have given patients a better story about his experience .
how does a story draw ?
and that &apos;s true for stories that makes us us and it &apos;s also true for stories that we invent .
so , a story of a story is shifting towards the clarity , significant moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , it &apos;s going to end .
now , the <unk> self lives alive continuously .
it has moments of the <unk> , one after another .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean most moments of life -- and i &apos;ve got this kind of thing -- you know , the psychological present , for about three seconds . which means , you know that there &apos;s about 600 million of them -- and there &apos;s about 600,000 . you know , there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of them .
most of them are completely ignored from the <unk> self .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count , that what happens during these moments of the life is happening .
it &apos;s the finite resource we consume as we &apos;re on this world .
and how we use it would seem to be important , but this isn &apos;t the story that &apos;s going to keep the <unk> self .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the greatest difference between you is time .
from the point of view , if you have a holiday and the second week is just like the first one , then the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
so this doesn &apos;t work at all for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> self , a <unk> vacation is barely better than the holiday holiday because there don &apos;t have new memories .
they don &apos;t change history .
and in this sense , time is actually the critical variable that is different different from a <unk> self , but it has very little impact on this history .
now , the <unk> self makes more than remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually one that makes decisions because if you have a patient , which , say two different projects at two different surgeons and decides that they should vote , then the one who has to vote , which is the one who has selected .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as experience .
we think about our future as a memory of memory .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as an tyranny of the self , and you can think about the most vulnerable self as one , which sort of sort of <unk> the <unk> self , which is not needs the <unk> self .
i have the impression that if we do holiday that &apos;s very often , that means we &apos;re on holiday in the service of the state of the self .
and this is a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given for the domination of the world &apos;s domination .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , the clearly the best holiday i had ever had , and i think quite often often in relation to how often i think about different research .
and i &apos;ve probably got my memories of this journey , i would say about 25 minutes for about 25 minutes for the last four years .
now if i ever opened the folder with 600 pictures i had spent another hour .
now , these are three weeks , and this is just a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
well , i may be a little bit extreme , you know , like little jewels i have on the memory of memory , but even if you make more of them , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight on the weight of the weight that we give ?
so i want you to think about a experiment experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the <unk> all of the pictures will be wiped out , and they get a drug drug that you will remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would vote on another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self and you need to think about how they choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious because if you think of your mind , you can get a answer , and if you could think of your mind .
why we choose the <unk> that we choose is a problem that gives us a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two types of self are throwing out two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then they would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the world ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments , a fairly complicated process .
which are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re able to get a fairly good idea of happiness itself over time .
if you ask the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a different thing .
this isn &apos;t about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy is that person is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who don &apos;t have these terms of things that are aging , and i &apos;m involved in a lot of researchers about our researchers that are doing for happiness long , that kind of kind of kind .
the distinction between happiness itself and happiness itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two of the <unk> .
the gallup paradigm has an emerging survey where more than half a million people have been asking about what they think about their lives and about their experiences . and there were other efforts in direction .
so we &apos;ve started to learn about happiness in the two species of self .
and the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , i think , learned is that they are really different .
you can know how happy somebody &apos;s touched with his life , and it really doesn &apos;t teach them much about how happy he lives alive and vice versa .
just to give you an idea of correlation , correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody , you would say you , oh , his dad is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s lots of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i say somebody &apos;s life than eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with his <unk> self .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what satisfaction determines the happiness .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mainly about being happy with people that we like , time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize the self , they &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
the implication of what i said here is that we really don &apos;t think happiness should be a replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s completely different concept .
now , briefly , another reason , which we don &apos;t realize happiness happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people are happier in california if you &apos;re , say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , on climate .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the self , and it &apos;s not even important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can end up -- some people might end up from california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens with people who are moving to california , hoping to become happier .
well , your own self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you will think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you will think about how terrible the weather was in ohio , and they become feel that they &apos;ve been able to have the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you an idea of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i got a question .
thank you .
now , when we &apos;ve heard a few weeks ago , i told me that there was a fairly interesting outcome that came from this gallup gallup poll .
is this something that you can do with us because you now have a few minutes left ?
daniel libeskind : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we found in the gallup survey is a number that we absolutely didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we were looking at what emotion vary with income .
and it turns out that under a income dollar dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income income dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly unhappy as they become poorer .
we get a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money is not raising a <unk> , but lack of money &apos;s money , and we can raise this misery very , very clearly .
in the spirit of self , the self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve better .
this isn &apos;t for emotion .
but danny , throughout american issues , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the quest to happiness .
if people would take this serious seriously , i mean , it seems to be able to get everything on your head , all we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians that the country would generally take a diagnostic problem for the seriously , and then based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of politics in politics .
the recognition gets begun to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now and in other countries .
people are unaware of , admit that they should think about happiness if they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to argue whether they want to explore or try to explore or whether they want to explore or explore , so we need to lead this discussion fairly soon .
how you can increase happiness is very different about how you think , and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the darwinian self .
this will affect politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to be able to measure the population of the population .
this is going to be , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this subject is going to be this subject , or at least the most interesting political debate for all the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been doing it for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade , is just to make it just easy to save the world in reality , how it &apos;s in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , more time playing with playing more and more comfortable .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole amount of time . &quot;
maybe too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in real world .
but actually , my research at the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week isn &apos;t nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i &apos;ve calculated that it took time at 21 billion hours per week .
this seems like something that seems like something else , so again i let it do it : if we &apos;re problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we &apos;re trying to play games online for least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this painting describes quite exactly why i think games are so critical for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographers .
he wanted to capture the emotion playing playing . so he has built a camera .
this is one of the classical expressions playing .
if you &apos;re not gamers , maybe some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also all returns , fully immersed in solving a really difficult problem .
and if you play , you see some nuances here , which is very very crisp eyes and your mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows tell you .
this is a player that &apos;s on the outskirts of one called the <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so we &apos;ve got some player here .
a <unk> victory is a result that is so positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you get it , they &apos;re shocked that they actually are capable of doing something like this . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is short of a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on the world &apos;s faces of food sites around the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , the face of those who are on the verge of all the <unk> on the outskirts of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more more living in real life , if we &apos;re difficult issues .
i refer to it as &quot; life , i &apos;m bad , &quot; <unk> . and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yeah ? ok .
i &apos;m like i &apos;m doing this &quot; in life . &quot;
this is an graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california where i studied in my thesis , why we &apos;re better than the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as playing .
and i don &apos;t only mean less successful , although that &apos;s about it .
we are getting more in more . i mean my good job with motivation , to do something more inclusive , inspired by collaboration .
if we are in a state of a state , i think many of us are moving into our best version , anytime and immediately helpfully resist , just trying to solve the problem as long as they need to try to try to try it again .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , when we collide in obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened by ourselves , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings don &apos;t have , if we play games , they don &apos;t have them .
and this is what i wanted to investigate as phd student .
why is it impossible to play , thinking , you couldn &apos;t just get anything ?
how can we get these feelings from playing these feelings ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft that offers the ideal change in cognition .
and i &apos;ve found some things that &apos;s possible by the possible possible possible possible .
so first , if you get into one of these things , especially in world &apos;s world , there are lots of different characters that are willing to make a very high-resolution mission , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at your current level , right ?
so they do this .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edges of your skills , so they have to do . but there &apos;s no unemployment in world &apos;s world .
you don &apos;t sit around and spin it . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are plenty of collaborators .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their dolphins mission mission .
we &apos;ve got this true life in true life , that feeling that at a high school , there are plenty of staff .
and then there &apos;s this epic history , this inspiring history why we are there and what we have .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about level high level , &quot; and &quot; + a strength &quot; or &quot; + intelligence than intelligence . &quot;
there isn &apos;t in the constant feedback , in true life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have to talk : + 1 : 1 shows a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get in the true life of this feedback .
so , the problem of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world is so satisfying , anytime on the outskirts of a <unk> , that we would rather be in this era of time .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all world &apos;s world of solar cells combined to solve virtual problems of <unk> .
this isn &apos;t necessarily something bad .
it may sound evil .
but to see it in context , we started to go back to our first <unk> day .
so the first upright primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently playing with play , it makes sense when you &apos;re going to do the time in terms of human development in terms of the human development .
but also , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time we use this whole time , actually change that &apos;s what we &apos;re able to do as a man .
we are developing ourselves together , very creatures .
this is the truth . i think i think .
look at this interesting statistic , recently , recently , recently , a researcher mellon university : the average young man today in a country with severe <unk> spends 10,000 hours with high school rights to 21 .
so 10,000 hours is an interesting number , for two reasons .
first , for kids in america , they are <unk> hours of the exact ones they spend in school , from five to high school at high school , if you never miss .
so we &apos;ve got a full hadron collider here , looking at young people , what it means to be a good player , like everything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have some of you have this new book from malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so she knows his theory of success , the theory of the successful science theory .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the <unk> that if we spend 10,000 hours with a meaningful subject of any subject to the 21 years of living , we are going to master in the master &apos;s .
we are so good at whatever the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is : &quot; what are gamers doing good ? &quot;
because if we could find this , we would never have been able to have any human potential before .
so many people have now in the world that spend at least an hour of <unk> at least one hour .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot;
and in the next decade we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , saving energy and work on work , rather than the <unk> , so gamers around the world , especially in india , especially in india , china ,
you expect an additional billion player in the next decade .
so we &apos;ve got 1.5 billion player .
so i started thinking about what it is , what is what these games do to master .
here are the four things i found . first : <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
so , <unk> is desire to do something immediately , a challenge , together with believing that we have a educated hope in success .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth trying to try and try and do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
gamers are masters at the spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s lots of interesting research that show that we might like to do people more than we &apos;ve played with them , even if they &apos;ve been evil .
and the reason for this is that there is a lot of trust to play a game .
we trust that somebody &apos;s time with us that the rules are going to be able to have the same goal and stay in the same time .
so this is enabled the <unk> to grow from bonds , trust and each other .
as a consequence of them we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
productivity productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s one reason why the <unk> of 22 hours per week is called a <unk> .
and the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard , when we do anything , or not doing anything .
we know that we do optimal , if we get hard to do significant work .
and gamers are always ready to work hard if they get the right job .
and ultimately , meaning meaning .
players love it , part of awe missions of missions .
here &apos;s a <unk> to go into the right light , you know all wikipedia , the greatest fashion of the world .
the second largest mushroom around the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world books on the internet than any other subject in every other animal in every other fashion .
they create another epic story .
they create a off-the-shelf source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
okay , so these are four superpowers who lead to one single outcome , players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as one world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in education .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to witness less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me ... i develop games , i &apos;m a bit of a bit of a bit .
so he says that makes sense , because gamers can achieve more than real life than real life .
they can make stronger social bonds as in real life . they get more feedback and reward in games as real life .
so he says , it &apos;s now completely clear that gamers are more time in virtual world than in real .
i just agree that it &apos;s logical .
but definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
before these fantastic <unk> , there was <unk> .
and this was kind of the first of people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the earliest greek <unk> , you may know this story . history may know how and why games were invented .
according to games , games were also invented , more <unk> , in the kingdom of famine .
there was such such big famine that the king of <unk> came to an crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . it needed one extreme solution .
so they invented , loud , <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> national strategy . you would eat a day . the next day you would play .
and they would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of that fascinating , and we &apos;re with <unk> , <unk> productivity surrounding us that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and loud <unk> survived for 18 years that they survived for this famine by eating a day and played on the next day .
so , i think we &apos;re going to play games today .
we &apos;re playing games to escape the world &apos;s suffering .
we &apos;re playing games to get everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially that in real life is not satisfying , and we get us what we need .
but this doesn &apos;t need to be the end .
this is exciting .
according to 18 years , famine was not better better . so the king decided to be last <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they played a <unk> and gave the pub to an unnatural adventure .
they went out and went to search for a new home . they were just going to get so many people back to how food had survived and looked at the rest of a neighborhood where they could flourish .
this sounds crazy , isn &apos;t ?
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> , which is the roman empire , the same dna as the old ones .
so scientists recently came to understand that <unk> &apos; crazy story actually is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global technology system that could explain almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could be voices .
maybe they actually saved their people through play , they &apos;ve been working for 18 years in games and then had these <unk> and so much about dealing with each other , they learned that they &apos;ve been saving all of civilization .
so we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing with 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in time in the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world .
they were working for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying , we &apos;re ready for our own personal game .
so they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion dollars of a week .
we should be able to spend a time that half of us have been doing with play an hour of play with the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and right this question i &apos;ve asked my work for the future for the future .
we &apos;ve got this banner in our office in palo alto , it &apos;s how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to introduce us the best possible , and then people empower to make this idea into reality .
we &apos;re going to have possible by a way and give people the ability to accomplish it .
i &apos;m going to show you about three games i designed to try to try to get people without allowed people &apos;s lives .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you need to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we &apos;ve got enough to do it for it , and you &apos;re actually living their real life without oil , so if you &apos;re going to be able to do it , you &apos;ll get to get your life on your life , and then you &apos;re asking them to make it more , and you &apos;re asking them to make them more , and you &apos;re asking them to make them more comfortable , and you &apos;re asking them to make them more comfortable , you &apos;re going to do it
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an changing experience .
no one wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an unnatural adventure , and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go from oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going on .
find out how they were going to survive , most of our players have maintained behavior in the game .
so we &apos;ve got a bigger game for the next game , higher target than just <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for the future .
now , what is a calculation of a truism that people are only left 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
and the call for gamers , sign up , we &apos;ve designed almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> where it &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; : they have astronauts , scientists , the scientists , and just together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everyone &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 basic solutions that they can read if they accept &quot; <unk> &quot; .
and the last game we take on march three , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world world .
if you finish the game , you get from the world bank , the award for social <unk> , or 2010 .
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa and invite them to learn social redesign .
we have a comic book . we &apos;ve got level high for learning , health care , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all around the world , especially in the world , all of them who benefit together their own social enterprise to save their own social enterprise .
i &apos;m going to end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think happens next ?
we have all these amazing players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t even save the world yet .
well , i hope you agree that there are the number of human resources that we can use to work in real life , and games have a huge meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to engage close social networks , <unk> and desire for questioning meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing significant games to survive on this planet , to survive .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me with me and play .
if i &apos;m going to go forward to the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can make any other things that we can do every single future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start playing the games !
thank you .
i would like to tell you something that i wrote a few months ago writing article on this article for wired wired .
i &apos;ve always got my favorite hand on the day , but i was done with the text of text , and i noticed that i never had my life in my life , which means &quot; disabled &quot; . &quot;
i read them the post .
&quot; disabled &quot; : &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , helpless , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , falling , falling , falling , falling , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> : healthy , strong , competitive . &quot;
i was reading this list loud loud and had to laugh , you know , it looked like this , but i just came up until &quot; moma &quot; and couldn &apos;t stop and collect me by this <unk> shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , i thought that the copy has to be quite old .
but actually , there was a copy on the early &apos; 80s , when i was just beginning to school school and started to build my self outside my family &apos;s self , also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and god thank you thank you thank you .
would i take this point seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me would perceive me as a person whose life could be positive in any positive sense , but today i &apos;m going to have the opportunities and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately navigated to the <unk> of 2009 , and expect me to find a whole thing here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she isn &apos;t much better .
especially my words are in &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy &quot; and healthy .
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many of these societies , including the the greeks and the romans , really believed that they were a huge force , because what you &apos;re out loud , it can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
so , what do we want to do is a <unk> man or a powerful person ?
you know , just a man &apos;s office as a kid , could be enough , and you want to have beliefs about it .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
a person who opened to me was my pediatrician at the <unk> dupont institute in <unk> .
it &apos;s dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t tell you correctly , so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always carried very colorful , and was just designed for kids as well .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just cool -- until my favorite school .
i had to do some exercises with this thick , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- you know to build my <unk> , and i hated them more hated than anything else . i &apos;ve hated her .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even asked me as a young kid with dr. p. and trying to stop these exercises , <unk> without success .
and one day he was watching me at one of my work -- these exercises were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll rip one of these claws .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick by dr. p. so i &apos;m doing exercises i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the highest five girls were in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily health company in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily health experience .
and i ask today how much his vision of me as strong and powerful young girls had shaped my self and i could imagine myself as a nature of strong , powerful and respectful man .
this is just one example of many ways that adults can make a child &apos;s imagination .
but as they &apos;re seeing examples of the <unk> show us , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine what we would want all of us to do : it every single way to see himself as powerful people .
our language is based on social change , which has been triggered by a technological change .
and of course , from the medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of titanium , <unk> of titanium and artificial <unk> for aging bodies that allow people to use their ability to make their own own , and they &apos;re able to define their own own own own own , and they &apos;re not talking about the limitations that they &apos;re using their natural destiny .
so maybe this technological change is clearly clear to clearly because ever that there was always another truth , which is that every person who has a whole bit of knowledge and very powerful , and that human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability adapt -- this is an interesting story because people always ask me to tell me about how i &apos;m with <unk> , i &apos;m going to say something that was this sentence for me , and i &apos;m always comfortable with the questions of people who are asking people .
this sentence of dealing with the <unk> lives of the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge to master a challenge without being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do with a platform , or as if my life would be so successful because i could be able to be able to be able to do with a platform .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing us . of course we &apos;re inherently beneficial , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both of them .
and i &apos;m saying that that &apos;s good .
so , there &apos;s no barrier that we need to have to get better to get better attention .
<unk> just are just in our lives .
and i tend to see time-lapse warriors as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely seeing , but it &apos;s always for me .
and i want to not want to do the impact of the brain , or the heavy of a man &apos;s disease .
there &apos;s a lot of challenges in life and challenges , and they are only real , and each person is about something different about it , but the question isn &apos;t whether we &apos;re going to get clear or not , but how we get clear .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people who love to preserve the <unk> , but they prepare for it to prepare good at this .
and we don &apos;t get any of our children when we give them feel that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : one of the medical fact , amputated , and the social thinking about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability , which i had to get apart is that the world was constantly saying that the world is all all the time , you can describe me with this definitions .
in our wish , protecting people that are at heart and you &apos;re going to say to the cool truth about their medical debate or even a prediction in their health care , which they expect , we &apos;re not going to get out that somebody &apos;s actually disabled .
maybe this is what we &apos;re looking at is this concept that just looks at what is broken in a broken , and how we fix this , for every individual disability than the diagnosis .
if we don &apos;t treat people wholly seriously , not all its forces and possibilities and recognizes , we &apos;re also going to do in addition to the natural battle that they might have to lead , another disease .
we &apos;ve got a people who has value for our society .
so we have to look out beyond the <unk> and focus on all the parts of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our copying and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not be able to do these more selfish times or either either , we should not try to avoid them , we should be able to go them underneath the carpeting , but it &apos;s about finding opportunities .
i may say it &apos;s more about that , to ask that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome the problem of solving , but we &apos;re open to embracing them , you &apos;re going to take them up to take a basketball program , and maybe even use it .
and maybe we &apos;re able to see it as a natural system as a bit natural , <unk> and useful and feel like that through their presence .
we celebrate 200 . the birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , in my eyes , on some very true character .
i would rearrange it : not the most powerful way of its kind , and not the kind of the way that changes changes in the best .
conflict comes creativity .
not just darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people , survive and <unk> , from the fight of the human mind is inherently able to transform through conflict .
so again , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and perhaps we know what wood we &apos;re cut out of what we &apos;re actually cut out of .
perhaps that &apos;s true of the sense of <unk> , a sense of the <unk> , a sense of our own force .
we can pay ourselves something like this .
we can give up a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve made ourselves from is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s honestly -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal normal .
there &apos;s common . the typical . but not the normal ones . and would you really learn this arms , grey person who really want to learn about if they were really ?
i think rather not .
it would be great if we have this paradigm of normal against another kind of possibility or strength , to even do a little bit more dangerous to formulate , we could use the forces of lots of children , and invite them to help their special and valuable skills .
and we found out that we &apos;ve always found people from members of our society , to be useful and to do a contribution .
there are evidence that neanderthal neanderthal has been infected people and people with severe physical injuries , and maybe this happened because the <unk> in the community of these people was value for society .
they don &apos;t have these people as not as well as futile ; they were treated as special and valuable .
a few years ago i went into the city where i grew up in a village in red zone in the las red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in a solitary tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had a <unk> .
and i hear like a guy behind me says , &quot; well if that isn &apos;t aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m looking around and see this older man . i had no idea who he &apos;s .
and i said &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i cannot remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t remember me .
when i saw her first time , i took her my mother &apos;s stomach . &quot;
oh , so .
and of course , it did it out , then did click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man i just knew about stories of my mother about this day because i was naturally consistent , my birthday two weeks late .
doctors &apos; medical medical adviser was on holiday , and so my parents had the man who brought me to the world , who didn &apos;t .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had been around you and i had some toes on this and some toes on the other leg was the <unk> , this foreign had had to fix bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never would never run , and never would be like other kids or you never have any independent life , and they &apos;ve never got me lying . &quot;
i found that i found my entire childhood <unk> , whether i had won a <unk> in the second grade , whether i had been had my scholarship or my athletic medical school , and he used this clips to teach his students , <unk> medical school , and he used this clips to teach his students .
and he called this part of his <unk> x factor , the potential of human willingness .
you can simply not emphasize enough to make this factor of life &apos;s quality of life .
and dr. <unk> told him , he said , &quot; i learned that children when they were not told anything else , and even if they get a few support , you can get children in their own , then children can get lots of . &quot;
look , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he had understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone interacted with it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking over time , if you were asked me at age 15 years , if i had my prosthesis against legs from meat and bones , i couldn &apos;t have a second .
i wanted to be normal in time .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not sure .
and this is happening because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not yet that experience .
and maybe this change could happen to happen , because i &apos;ve encountered so many people who opened to me to meet the doors , rather than looking at people who wanted me to make me feel like a idea .
you see , it really needs one people who can show you how they can make their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to regulate your own , inner forces -- the human mind is so much as a human mind -- if you do this , and for someone to give someone a very critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the darwinian root system in &quot; <unk> &quot; .
it means something that means that in one is , that &apos;s the potential .
again , which is opportunity we want to apply ?
in the 1960s in britain in britain , in the 1960s , <unk> was transformed into <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in america , we call this as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are divided out of grades .
and the a student will get severe risk of money , getting better teachers and so on .
they then gave over a <unk> period of students with a &quot; sufficient &quot; &quot; very good &quot; . they were told you were a very smart , and after those three months , they were actually written in <unk> .
and of course , it breaks a heart that vice versa , vice versa , they were just enough .
and then it was after three months .
but just those who were still in school -- except by students who had thrown out school .
so critically , in this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that were the <unk> , and that &apos;s the students with the note , and they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a spirit mind that was broken , has no longer has no longer , it &apos;s not lacks our natural , high-tech <unk> and our innate capacity of imagination .
but if we create it , to support the human spirit , hoping to help themselves and other people around themselves , really curious and <unk> , we actually put our forces really positive .
if a spirit has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new organizational systems .
i want to end with a poem that knows from a persian poet called <unk> in the 14th century and my friend jacques <unk> , and the poem called &quot; god who knows only four words , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name
come on dance . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are right ?
suppose i said that by a few changes of your genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more more and faster .
or want to be more inclusive , more force , more force .
do you want to be attractive and confident ?
how would it be longer living in good health ?
or maybe they are one of those who always always more creativity .
which would you like most ?
which would you want to have if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would vote ?
raise your hands . let me see .
some . probably about many people here are creative people here .
this is very good .
how many would choose to make a good memory ?
some more .
how would it be done ?
a few less .
what is longevity ?
ah , most of . i love to be a doctor .
if you could have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is this just ludicrous ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a profound theme here on the conference , but today i want to give you a doctor in a doctor .
the great geneticists in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , wrote a article called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good moment , your earrings , take your personal memory -- i give them permission , and perhaps you can take a glimpse of a look at kathryn <unk> &apos; book , and you can see a look at it .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other health care or it &apos;s good ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this image , i &apos;ve got a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the existing ones in the tops of these branches were successful in evolutionary response : they have been successful , it has its surroundings to be done , they have its surroundings .
so the human part of this era , far at the end , is what we &apos;re interested in most .
we branch from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about about six or eight million years .
in this period period , maybe maybe maybe 20 or 25 different types of hominids .
some came up and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 2,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re fairly remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually most of them , are the basic mechanisms of our cells quite equal .
so is clear that we can use it from this and create the mechanisms of a shared bacteria to produce the protein of human brain , which is using the grid of the human genome ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is chemically <unk> from what comes from your pancreas .
and since we &apos;re talking about bacteria , you realize that each one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it makes cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times many times .
i mean , think if antonio damasio asks about your self thinking about bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully functional environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s very comfortable , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re all going to get all nutrients that they might provide without effort for effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , with occasional occasional interruptions of unintended , <unk> , forced to push .
but otherwise , you &apos;re an amazing environment for these bacteria , just as they care about their lives .
they help it by digestion nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of selfish equilibrium in a species ?
or are we supposed to be something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s go back to a step back at the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- earth , the solar system , about four four years ago -- the first sign of creatures , perhaps three to four billion years , and then the first thing that creates the first <unk> organisms , maybe the first <unk> organisms , which creates the first <unk> of years .
in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , it &apos;s just about just 50 , the animal kingdom , like a single individual , and human life , a small <unk> .
we were .
this is also the most fundamental of this speech , so i hope you &apos;ve got it .
now , when i was a school school school , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i love love with the force of evolution , and i asked , something very basic : most of the life of life in most advanced organisms , each cell is sharing each cell , and all the genetic information that cell will continue to move on both .
but at time , as a self-organizing organisms showed up , they began to change things .
sexual reproduction starts in the image .
and quite important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction that are going to put the genome out of the body .
indeed , you could say that the death penalty of death in evolution in evolution at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i must admit , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed quite reasonable at the moment , but it seemed quite practical at all of this time , but it was been true for every year , it &apos;s been true to my increased wisdom .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who was las his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful small <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to realize as a doctor , i was a goal of a goal of evolution -- not inevitably contrary , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to reconnect to a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all over copying the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are and i developed how much <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of orbit , to put it down into sea .
i think we would all bring your mood , the woody wisdom , understanding , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
i want to get it by not going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t inevitably mean to more life .
it doesn &apos;t inevitably inevitably inevitably the biggest ones , the most or the fastest , not even the brightest .
evolution is the creatures that adapt to the environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the reason of the ocean are there are bacteria available , and they &apos;re able to survive that hot steam otherwise if fish were there , they would have a vacuum of boiled fish , yet they &apos;ve managed to get a <unk> environment for themselves .
so , what means if we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and especially as we &apos;re going to say that there &apos;s a series of opportunities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve achieved a kind of equilibrium .
and the reason for this would be that we &apos;ve been obsessed by medicine , we &apos;ve succeeded in a lot of genes that would otherwise have been gone from the population from the population .
and secondly , we as an species , we &apos;ve got our environment so much that we &apos;ve done it that they adapt to us precisely , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we travel and circulate and mix and make us so much that they can &apos;t tell you that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolutionary rights .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s an evolution of traditional style , of course , imposed by nature nature .
and the argument , here was that the wheels of evolution is slowly but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far as the isolation goes , if we colonize planets , it will be insulation and the change in environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that doesn &apos;t simply be , but led to us as a <unk> of the decisions that we do .
well , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s look at the reality that people today , in some cultures are making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the one and the family choose .
so think if it couldn &apos;t possibly be able to vote your child , but also could make genetic adaptations that would cure disease and avoid disease .
what if you could make the genetic change to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or eliminating the risk of risk or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re going to get , these kinds of change are becoming increasingly able to be able .
so the human genome project began in 1990 and it took 13 years .
it costs billions dollars .
following year 2004 , 2004 was finished , they could do this for 20 million dollars in the three months .
today , you can see one sequence of three billion base pairs of human genome to a price of about $ 2,000 and in the room of about a week .
it will not take more long to be able to be that there &apos;s going to be 1,000 dollars human genomes , and it will be increasingly accessible for everybody .
before a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the <unk> prize for francis arnold and <unk> , two scientists , which developed the natural process of evolution to work faster and to create animal proteins in a more efficient fashion -- which is called a more efficient fashion .
a few years ago , the scientist who was asked for his research in he took an adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four genes , the cell is able to return them to an pluripotent cell cell -- a cell can potentially put them back to an pluripotent cell .
these changes are in .
the same technology that creates human insulin cells can produce viruses that don &apos;t only protect themselves , but also to the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental trial with vaccine against influenza that has been grown into the cells of a solar system .
can you imagine a good idea that comes from tobacco ?
this is all true reality today , and in the future will be possible much more possible .
so then you just ask two different changes .
you can change cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could change sperm and <unk> or the fresh egg to make your children better chance for a more talented life -- eliminating diabetes , eliminating the risk of cancer , reduce risk of cancer ?
who wouldn &apos;t want to do healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor science that can enable change to avoid disease , could also enable us to adopt a <unk> strategy , <unk> , <unk> , better memory .
why don &apos;t the <unk> of a bright <unk> , especially if you add it to the next generation of the ?
why not the fast maintenance services have that they will make them faster and longer and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we are in a place where we can pass it on the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes of ourselves that we want , we will be transformed by <unk> evolution to the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might require that in policy possibly 100 years , and we can compress it up for thousands of years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with those of their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to be able to be .
use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more effective , the more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to make a society of <unk> and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we have to meet .
and most lowest of all , we will ever be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom that we are going to need to make these decisions ?
well , in the good ones , in evil , and early as you might think , these decisions are going to be .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a bit of a portable robot that gives you some skills , or another , which helps you get up and go back and go .
we at berkeley , we call these robots out of the robot .
they &apos;re nothing else than something that you put in morning and gives them additional strength and keep your velocity more and keep you going to help you make your balance .
this is indeed , the true no one of human and machine .
but not only that -- it &apos;s connecting and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
this isn &apos;t just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about america &apos;s american soldier that &apos;s at average about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the urge that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would take us this challenge , and create a <unk> system that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or the human rights is universal <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can carry 200 pounds over the slippery terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design enables it to be deeply living in living , and to produce highly inclusive movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and then raise my strength and resilience .
we are far as we think with our <unk> of this device , this new seed system in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at our view , the users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are punished in the wheelchair .
this is about one percent of the population .
and this is indeed an conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord , who in the height of their life -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; agnostic -- who were struck by fate and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , their numbers themselves .
and so much the only option -- if it goes around a <unk> , or for another complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it has been been for 500 years since he has to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a entirely new chapter in mobility .
let me show you now , that by amanda , that &apos;s carried by amanda , 19 years ago , which has been a <unk> , which has been able to run more than 19 years , and now .
thank you .
like i said , amanda carries our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely beneficial sensors in the crutches , the signals that are encoded on our back on your back on your back .
here are also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as on your <unk> , which they move forward into this fairly <unk> and very natural gear .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> during a <unk> .
i lost every sense of a second , every sense of my <unk> .
not long after after after after after after after after after after , a doctor &apos;s got in my dorm room and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go back again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every <unk> hope from my consciousness .
so , <unk> technologies have been learning to learn , again , again , travel again , ride with the hands wheel .
but nothing was invented to leave me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got all the potential here to change life from future generations -- not only for the soldier , or for amanda here , all users , but all users , but for all .
thank you .
home in new york , i &apos;m a head of the <unk> of a non-profit called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get poverty , i &apos;m going to be a <unk> of a <unk> in a volunteer system .
now , in our city , in volunteers , volunteers were a very early <unk> , you need to be quite early on the <unk> to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer to the <unk> , i had fairly good opportunities .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to get to get to get out of the people who would be going to be our jobs .
when i found the <unk> , he was just in a very serious conversation with the <unk> , certainly one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of night and she stood in the middle of the night and barefoot out under a screen outside in the rain rain , during her house .
the other volunteers who was just been around me -- let &apos;s call him martin luther -- got asked to go into the house and became asked to go to the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was misled .
there was any lawyer or a lawyer who was now for the rest of his life that could tell people that he was going into a home house to save an creatures because he was five seconds faster than i .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; founder , you need to go into the house .
you need to go up , you have to go up on the fire , and get this woman from some shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hope i would get , but i went down stairs -- walking down the hallway at the real &quot; right &quot; <unk> that was just going to be pretty much done in the bedroom , to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you think , but i &apos;m not hero .
i was got back down my prey , where i met my <unk> and my loved dog .
we got our treasures out out of the <unk> , where , not surprising , getting more attention than my own .
several weeks later , the <unk> received a letter of the <unk> where they were doing for the brave assessment in the rescue of her house .
one of all , we &apos;ve got measurements of very mild kindness : somebody had brought her some shoes .
both my job in my profession in robin hood , as well as a volunteer writer , i &apos;m looking for generosity and kindness on big scale , but i also see the charity and the <unk> of one .
and you know what i learned ?
they are all important .
so if i see myself in this room and see people who have either achieved a success of success or on your path , i want to give this memory memory : wait you don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until they have achieved your first million .
if you have something to give something , you &apos;ll give it right now .
put them in a <unk> hall , putting them in the neighborhood , in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save a life of a person , but each day offers us the opportunity to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m coming back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s human .
a place where women lead to the women &apos;s sex , say sex &apos; hi &apos; &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is serious matter .
and no , it &apos;s not rocket cream or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the forest river .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
well chimpanzees are known for their own .
but unfortunately we &apos;ve got this aspect of the human evolution history .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
whereas chimpanzees of great , fear of great , fear of <unk> females are led by females .
they really have up there because this leads to a very common society , in the lethal violence has not been seen in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately bonobos are least known as the primates .
they live in the deep of the <unk> , and they &apos;re just hard to be able to use it .
congo is a paradox -- a country remarkable biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness -- the location of a violent clash that has been required for decades of decades , like the first war war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction are survival of the bonobos at risk .
and <unk> and the decline in the decline , you don &apos;t even have a stadium with the aerodynamic bonobos -- and even we &apos;re not secure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a laugh that the trees are shattered .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> , also sex with social partners , with social partners and social health programs .
i &apos;m not saying that this would be the answer to all humanitarian issues -- because life &apos;s life is from more than the <unk> .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean .
for us and it &apos;s a game essential for connection to connection and care of the care of the tolerance .
we &apos;re learning trust and the rules of the game .
play enhances creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s about creating diversity of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you see bonobos at play , you see the evolutionary origins of human power , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that &apos;s going to us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first one <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about it .
so here we see a young female and male in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she grabs him for eggs . &quot;
i think it &apos;s more like it , not .
yeah !
so , <unk> are prevalent , both of bonobos than humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> that you can get to play new elements -- like the testes -- how the testes -- and also how the work is both comfortable as well .
but the game is a <unk> .
game is a <unk> , and there can be lots of forms that some some frightening things are frightening , <unk> , curious -- maybe to explore again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young females , and she plays peacefully with water .
i think exactly how they &apos;re sometimes going to play , and we &apos;re also fully inclusive limits of our inner and outward worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research and interact . and the unexpected registration that we form is truly sources of creativity .
this is just a small <unk> of insight , the bonobos that bonobos give us our past and present .
but it also creates a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to rising challenges , through greater creativity and vulnerable cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
so to adapt to a cooperative world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best from our business ? ?
play isn &apos;t silly .
it &apos;s crucial .
for bonobos and humans , they don &apos;t have their life from teeth and claws alone .
just if it seems barely appropriate , game may be on the <unk> .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution and play together , while we &apos;re doing creativity and wonder of the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , middle 1979 , at the same day , at the moment , every one baby , every baby &apos;s a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every baby &apos;s a baby .
now i don &apos;t want to use too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you think about the whole time you &apos;re going to think of the time , you will not listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this marketplace , you imagine that in one case , there &apos;s a y called a y , which meets the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , there &apos;s a x chromosome that meets the x chromosome of the egg .
both of these are <unk> , both light .
we &apos;ll come back on these people later .
i &apos;ve got two aversion on most of my activities .
i &apos;m talking about a hat with the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m studied a research professor , and in this case i investigate , i investigate , like humans , like , human bodies -- animal bodies -- like they were with <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> ; how they thought about bodies .
the other hat i carried on my work is actually an activist as a <unk> -- or i sometimes say , as impatients lawyer -- from people who are patients who are doctors .
in this case i worked with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question .
so i &apos;ve worked with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller as common .
and very often i worked with <unk> people whose gender are <unk> -- so people who have the average male or female <unk> .
and as common term we can use this word for the word .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i give you just some examples of the types of <unk> that aren &apos;t like male or female standard .
in one case you might have somebody with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y leaves the <unk> that we &apos;ve all got to have all of them grow up .
and therefore they were willing to get testosterone on the very high days .
but because this individual missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , your body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no reaction .
as a consequence , the body developed more of the typical female trajectory .
if the child gets born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as girls .
but it &apos;s mostly until they reached puberty and grow their breasts and develop , but they don &apos;t get their period until somebody comes out that there &apos;s something else .
and they do some tests and find out that they instead of <unk> and uterus , actually dressed in himself and that she has a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person &apos;s manly for the word , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something that you call a <unk> .
they are in the back of our body .
and the <unk> locations are <unk> , which are hormones .
most women , like me -- i think i think i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual feature , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like i actually talk about <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like i actually had a brain that was subjected to more <unk> than a woman who was born with testes , and a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; they don &apos;t only stand in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be distributed over the whole range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call call a 19 man who was born as young boy who had been loved , had sex with his girlfriend was living as man , and he had just found that he had <unk> and one uterus .
he had an extreme form of an innate form .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in utero , his <unk> were so strong that they basically created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his shaped male had been smuggled on his brain was exposed to the most sacred male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- no one knew something .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually because he was in inside the way that doctors found that he was in inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a version of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosome , develop something called the <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so sex can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or identical twins , it &apos;s been <unk> -- surgeons often are being adapted to the norm isn &apos;t because this was for their physical health of advantage .
in many cases these people are totally healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often done different kinds of surgical surgeries , because they threaten our social categories .
mostly our system is based on the idea that one certain anatomical characteristic has a certain identity .
so we have this concept that one woman is called a female identity , a black person is called said , an african anatomy in terms of your own history .
so we &apos;ve got this awful <unk> idea .
and if we have faced with a body , which is actually something very different , really confused us that &apos;s about this <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation really has actually based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , which are two people in a body .
where i had experienced most excitement , the <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender <unk> in the day of the <unk> world &apos;s cup in a question .
many journalists were called me to ask me , &quot; what test will you do that tells us whether or <unk> <unk> is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain journalists , that there &apos;s no test that they don &apos;t have .
we now know that sex is complicated enough that we admit that nature doesn &apos;t have to pull out between male and female and female and female and female and environmental groups , and we &apos;re talking about that line as we &apos;re .
so we have a situation where we continue to continue to do our science , we &apos;ve got to admit that these categories that we &apos;ve given for stable anatomic categories that were very easy diagnostic systems , which is a very simple diagnostic system , a lot of <unk> than we &apos;ve accepted .
and that &apos;s not only related to gender .
it &apos;s also about laughter , which turns out as much more complicated than allowed our <unk> .
we &apos;ve got into our essays in all kinds of disciplines .
we push for example , in the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we start with the fact that we just differ from them through few ways ?
and while we keep our science move forward , we get increasingly into a zone zone , where we need to recognize that the most egalitarian categories we had probably been too easy .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas where we see this to the <unk> , in our current culture , in today &apos;s united states , are the battles over the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard talking about what point a body is going to be , so that he &apos;s a different fairly fairly true than fetal life .
we &apos;ve got very hard battles today -- perhaps not as public as medicine -- about the question when somebody is dead .
our ancestors used to never fight as hard to fight when someone was dead .
they just kept a feather under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them .
if she didn &apos;t moved it , you &apos;ve got it buried .
but today we are in a situation where we &apos;re taking people every single organs and put them together other people .
and as a consequence , we were going to get us with the really difficult question when somebody is dead , and that &apos;s bringing us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categories as they used .
now they might assume that all of the collapse of categories would make me happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i &apos;ve got people with unusual bodies , but i must admit , i &apos;m nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more comfortable than we thought , was tense .
and it makes me tense in thinking about thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i got to see , first , i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so much as strong and strong , and so radical where they did all of the years of doing this <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the <unk> .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original american activists , and that &apos;s why .
what she was was a <unk> concept , and they were looking at it through another that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you remember all , our founding refused to be the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very trivial concept of anatomy .
the masters of the old world didn &apos;t have any concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , who should have political power because of the <unk> of the grandfather &apos;s family , to son , and so on .
the founding took this idea back and decided they were brought them through a new concept , and this concept said that all people were being created by the same .
they put the field field and decided that <unk> that count common , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this because they were part of a system of system , in which two things are in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew up .
if you look at the history of the founding from the founding of the founding , clearly that many of them were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a cooperative world .
they went away from explanation of explanation , and meadows , things like an psychic concept of power , back where the transmission of a very functional concept of <unk> is based on a very basic concept .
they moved to a very depressing concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature of god .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
and as part of this gave us a concept that was about common commonalities .
and so they &apos;ve got it in really wonderful ways that we were prepared for the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after this ?
for example , women who were using the <unk> , the concept of founding nature , saying that anatomic is more important than the anatomical friction , and said , &quot; we should have one uterus and the law , and so , etc .
and women were successful successful .
next came to the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> who are going on over it , &quot; am i not woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> line of the <unk> who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin color that are <unk> elsewhere in common differences in common , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the world .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the commonalities , we need to start asking for why we maintain certain kinds of value .
well , mind , i want to have certain kinds of <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish that &apos;s not the same right as one person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that business workers should be right to give their informed consent to sex or marry married .
so there are some anatomic groups that make sense of me , and we should keep thinking .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what they are and why we keep them and why they &apos;re feeling .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been been <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both middle 1979 at the same day .
imagine that one of you , maria , three months of <unk> , she &apos;s born on june 1 .
henry , on the other side , is born to the <unk> , so he &apos;s born on one march 1980 .
except because of the fact that maria was born three months , they get all kinds of two months ago , <unk> -- the fairly <unk> sex , that &apos;s right to vote that right .
charlie has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the birth of birth .
we &apos;re finding other ways of what their rights are .
henry , because you take male , although i didn &apos;t say that it &apos;s called the <unk> -- because you take one of it , it can go into the front of what maria doesn &apos;t need to worry .
maria is not in all states that &apos;s the same right , that was in all states , and that &apos;s right to marry that .
charlie can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman in many states .
so we &apos;ve got these sustained <unk> categories in many ways and stereotypical .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing progress in the history of anatomy that we have to do a point where we admit that democracy is based on anatomy , could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a democracy ?
i don &apos;t want to give science , but at the same time it feels like the science has its own .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would be a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; good , we need to pull anywhere anywhere , so we pull them anywhere . &quot;
but lots of people caught caught in a very strange position .
so for example , south texas , texas , i decided to marry a man that you have no y chromosome , and marry a woman means that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested in their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us to talk about a dream &quot; kind of solution .
he says we should not say people &quot; your skin color , but after the attribute of your character , &quot; and beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do this in practice ?
how do you tell people about their earrings ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to give right on people on people because i admit i must be a series of golden <unk> that probably benefits better than some people who know .
i want to suggest that i probably know some bright bright things that are <unk> , more intelligent and more intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships as some of some of the ones i know .
so how shall we make the question of the characteristics of character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and one part of me wonder about what would be if the content of a personality would be something that would be a difference in the future -- could be made visible visible ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems to think about thinking that the united states is leading to thinking about questions about democracy .
in our endeavor , democracy has done really good , and i think we would do our things in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like this is in iran in iran , where a man who attracted to other men who are punished with death , because it &apos;s ready to be a <unk> program where he &apos;s allowed to live alive .
states of this kind of kind of thing exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon who was talking about a few years ago that had a few twins twins twins had been able to get them in part of a name .
but when i was doing it , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was high surgery surgery -- was his answer that in his country , these children would be very bad treated , and therefore he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , have they seriously seriously seriously assumed to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible ways to allow people to be the ones that they are without that they would change for the state of dignity .
so i think we need to leader .
well , just to conclude , i want to realize i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about how democracy could look like , or looked like if we had mothers involved in .
and i want to say something that is radical , and i think there could be different ways that we could be able to be different kinds of insight that are from different kinds of anatomy , <unk> if people use a solar system .
since years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the field of research .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in ways that they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from studies of studies is that women , at average -- not each , but on average -- tend to be more complex social relationships and care for people who are in the group of vulnerable , very much attention .
and so if we think about this , we &apos;ve got an interesting situation .
years ago , when i made a interview , i asked one of my favorite my interest on feminism -- i looked at me as feminist , so it &apos;s still -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what was feminism on feminism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i ever heard .
feminism is about changing stereotypes about gender , so that feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , i thought that there could be something that was made some <unk> award in feminism .
this is supposed to be called something , on average , which is what women &apos;s brains are different from male social relationships , and make it for the <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the founding fathers were extremely focused on finding out how individuals were protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we &apos;re more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more inclusive of , not just as you can protect , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in future when we &apos;re talking democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies think about identity and thinking more about connection .
so that if we &apos;re trying to make a connection , we &apos;re trying to think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got in this , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to every chance to find another <unk> , crazy outfit , to get to take a time and photograph and blogging .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from just a second hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
so , <unk> allows me to reduce my health care impact on the environment and my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually for usually a good purpose ; i &apos;m quite unique ; and it makes a special personal job of my personal engineering .
i mean , what will i find today ?
will it have my size ?
am i going to love the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all answers yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been packing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does somebody get with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought brought me .
i brought seven pair of underwear , and this is all .
underwear for just a week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i made sure i would get anything else i might want to get , if i just came up to palm springs .
and since you haven &apos;t heard about me than the woman who runs here at ted in your underwear -- called this , i found some things .
and i want to show you my favorite books for this week .
sounds that good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons i &apos;m saying whether you believe it or not , not to wear anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tigers .
you don &apos;t need to spend much money to look great .
you can almost always look for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the coat has me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost obvious to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : so it &apos;s totally <unk> .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time my life with trying to be myself and adapt to myself .
just be who you are .
if you surround them with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to understand it , they &apos;re also valuing .
wednesday : embracing your inner child .
sometimes people say i saw as if i wear &apos; games or i remember her .
i wish to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost secure .
and if you think they don &apos;t look good , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap this up briefly for you .
if you think that you are a beautiful person inside and outside the outside , there &apos;s nothing that you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to be able to get anything to do what we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fits .
and finally , saturday : one of your own unique style , is a great way to tell the world about one word without saying a word .
it was always been proven to me and always proved that when i got people on me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had fantastic talking .
clearly obviously , it won &apos;t fit into my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home after brooklyn , i &apos;ll donate all over again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to get these things emotionally , because the corner is always going to be another crazy , <unk> , <unk> outfit that just waiting for me if i loved a little bit of love and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i &apos;ve got something i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , flying <unk> .
this is what we call in our lab , design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i was originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up with this painting in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is what i &apos;m going to show you is that what happened in the formula one in the last decades .
so long ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula for a time , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the run .
now today , you need if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that &apos;s going on , something that car has given a car in time , some thousand sensors that can pass information from the car , and then change it and use them to use this car , and use things back to the system and use things back to the system .
they would be in <unk> , called a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s from two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what today is interesting today is this is what we &apos;re starting to come up in our lives .
our cities were been in the last few years , just equipped with networks and electronics .
they are going to computers in the free .
and as computers in free , they start to respond to different ways , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
if we &apos;re cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
i would like to mention by the way , that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s earth , but 50 percent of the worldwide population there .
they are 75 percent of the energy fields -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond cities , all of this sense and drive all of this sense and drive into objects of daily life .
this is from an exhibition , spontaneous antonelli for moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , are going to go back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there to either , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this changes radically interactions that we have people out with our environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know when norden shaped founder , it means that he took the hammer on the end and he made him off him -- actually , they still can see a little bit of <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now today , our environment starts to respond to the first time .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , to understand our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it was developed four four four four years ago .
and what we did was actually actually using a new kind of network that was used around the world -- this is a <unk> -- and the anonymous and <unk> information from this network that works out of the operators to understand how the city works .
summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the <unk> won the <unk> .
some of you will remember , it was as italy , and then the end of the end , the <unk> .
and anyway , italy won &apos;t have the end .
now you see what happened on this day , just when the activity is happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
tomorrow morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
earlier afternoon , people here and there that are making calls and move .
the game starts to -- silence .
france makes a portal . italy makes a portal .
<unk> , people make a short call , go on toilet .
second <unk> . end of the normal .
first extension , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
now , at this night , all went into the center to celebrate .
they saw the big rash .
the next day , all went into the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at same time .
and then all went down .
you see the image of the location of the place , where , since the roman season , the time of the rome , go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and they see the rash at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way we couldn &apos;t do it several years ago .
so quickly another example of feeling : here &apos;s not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
well today , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we just know about where things go .
so we &apos;ve designed some little markers to follow the trash as it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that have been a year ago , a year , in seattle , have helped to tag on the things that they &apos;re going to see -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would make away .
then we have the little snacks , the little brands , on the trash and started tracking it .
here are the results that we &apos;ve got right .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and then we realized that information that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in fact , with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is a lot of <unk> <unk> and complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that cup that we throw away , not simply disappears that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the bottle bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we would show that people , we can drive behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could be able to see you much more about this and the many other wonderful things that you can do with perceive , but i want to talk to the second part that we &apos;d like to talk about the beginning of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did in <unk> , in spain , in spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> has a beautiful tradition , in public places , in public places , in part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were been in a <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re going to imagine this tubes tubes , and valves , valves , valves , valves , valves open and closing .
they &apos;re causing it as a <unk> with <unk> water .
if these plates fall down , you can write on it , you can write patterns , pictures , text .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s open to make them searchable , as you can see on this picture .
well , we &apos;ve introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it did it very much .
and we got the mission to design the expo to design the expo .
we called it out of digital water .
the whole building was from water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and put it into it .
the roof was covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy down , if you want to reduce these syringes , they can even cut the roof down .
or you could close the building and get all the architecture , like in this case , you know , this days , if you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they don &apos;t have the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened water , not wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night than all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was still a more fun thing .
all children from <unk> came to the building because the way they were playing with the building was completely different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them a building , but a building that still has breaks and holes in water , you had to jump out without wet .
and this was , very exciting for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , thinking about how people use things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the nice thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s now a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and projections .
and this is what brought us to think about the following project i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine these kinds of devices could really start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter that flies through air , and each one of you with a little bit of <unk> light with a little bit of light with a little bit of light with a little bit of light , almost like a cloud that can move through space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter as you saw before that you &apos;ve seen before each other , completely in sync .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or an ad , like these -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , but irregular , but what changes is changing , which is light , not the position of the .
you can play with different ways .
imagine the screen could easily appear in different types or sizes , different types of pollen .
but then all of the whole cloud could be from <unk> , which you can go to walk through and move through them that you can look at many ways .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> around as before a <unk> <unk> .
if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so as we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single person is controlled .
it could have a single impulse that has a momentum that comes from people , from the movements of people or things .
i want to show you something first .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater and the scale in milan -- we &apos;ve sampled his movements in 3d to use it as momentum for the patent system .
here &apos;s a dance bar .
on the left-hand side you see the <unk> , the different basic sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so they can feel all the movement .
they can do this all the time .
but then if we &apos;ve all got all the <unk> , you can play with it and play with color and play .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project where we work .
it &apos;s something that we work for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and then , again , you think about this , we think that we &apos;re bringing people together to do something and change the environment -- almost something like we call it <unk> as we call a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everyone can give a little donation for a <unk> .
i think that this remarkable thing that happened last years , last decades , we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and it &apos;s available through the internet .
now today , we can take for first time -- and the campaign has shown this -- we can see from digital world , from the digital world , from the world &apos;s forces .
this can be in our case that we use it to design it and create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be able to ask us the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from digital world to physical world .
so the idea is that we actually put people together with things together , collectively do .
the cloud is back again a cloud of food , in the same way , like a source cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s an physical shapes in london , but with <unk> .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from underneath , the most important moments for most of 2012 and the most important , and it &apos;s as kind of connection to community community .
so both of the physical cloud in heaven and something on its top you can go on , like london new new <unk> .
you can go inside .
and some kind of digital technology in night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for all that want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
i &apos;m trying to express that people are separated from nature and that everything connected together .
the first time i was almost 10 years ago at antarctica , where i saw my first slide slide .
i was embraced me .
my heart sped me , i was <unk> , while i was trying to grab what was before me .
the rolling around me almost almost 60 feet out of the water , and i was just understood that this was a snowflake on another snowflake year year .
recording events are born as calf of an glacier or by spraying out of <unk> .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with clear ways with their environment and their experiences .
some refusing give up and give us the bitter end , while others can &apos;t overcome and more dramatic passion in an antidote to an emergent interest .
if you look at a iceberg , you think easy you &apos;re excluded , apart and apart , just like we see people often .
but the truth is far away from it .
while a iceberg melt , i put his oily atmosphere .
during the iceberg melt it puts it contaminated water water , which feeds many life .
i &apos;m going to my pictures of this slide as i would make portraits my ancestors , in consciousness that they exist in these individual moments , and never again again again .
it &apos;s not death when you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but it &apos;s a <unk> of your <unk> off the life cycle .
one part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m a very young -- some thousand years old .
and one part of ice ice is more than 100,000 years old .
i want to show you the last pictures i want to show you , show a iceberg that i &apos;ve got in greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing an emergent iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left side , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts roll , and the boat moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a solar system .
he hid about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in time .
and just like this , you show you the iceberg another side of your personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed blessed with some amazing projects .
but at the coolest thing i ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back and said &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and this was the outbreak of als .
so , it &apos;s completely paralyzed .
he can only use his eyes again .
i stood on him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so i &apos;m inevitably a more complex part of what we admire in the art art and admire .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and support his thing .
i met his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want just want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk about him and i said , &quot; wait for me , &quot; wait for me -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- cannot all all paralyzed paralyzed people communicating these devices ? &quot;
and he replied , &quot; no , only if you heard about higher <unk> and it has a remarkable insurance , you can really do this .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you do it ? &quot;
did somebody see the movie &quot; butterfly and <unk> ? &quot;
so they communicate -- running along their fingers .
i &apos;m saying : &quot; very <unk> , how can this be ? &quot;
so i came with the need just just a check , and instead i hired a check that i couldn &apos;t know the slightest idea of how i should be .
i committed to place and ask about his brother and his father -- &quot; good , my proposal is this following : tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;ll get a machine back to it , and we &apos;ll find a way to make his art again .
because it &apos;s an farce that somebody who &apos;s still wearing it in yourself , cannot communicate . &quot;
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
i met these guys from <unk> , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows you to put a light on any surface and then draw with a <unk> that only was registered the negative surface .
so they pull around and make them like this .
they say that all things that are displayed up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the testes , they come down , and then the <unk> , and then they are doing the people in art .
but there was always a life life in your presentation .
i went home and ate with my wife and told her everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second second , if it &apos;s this technology that you can use to use your eyes , so we should find a path that they could make a laser , so that it could be a laser . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and lots of things , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first , we have the insurance the doors , and actually have a machine for <unk> to be able to communicate with -- a stephen scientist .
this was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> because you talk about it , or you get an email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and then we &apos;ve got seven programmers from all the world -- literally from all sides of the world -- literally from home .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hacker and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid to do that and we &apos;re all the pictures on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for for two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my children were involved in , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> and you can see the description .
this is a cheap seed system that we bought on the <unk> of venice , something that &apos;s a little bit of things out of the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they &apos;ve got them , they &apos;ve set them up a <unk> system , and now we have a device that &apos;s freely available to free -- you can build it yourself , we can use the code free for free , software can download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of limitations .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital .
every paralyzed paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into <unk> room .
i love this painting because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and this is his room .
now , there &apos;s all of these things that i &apos;m doing great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony came back after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life system life system system , and he &apos;s seeing his life support system .
we tend to be down bed to see it outside .
we &apos;ve got a projection against a wall of the hospital .
and he drew over again for the first time , in the family &apos;s family , and friends -- and you can just imagine what was on a sense that was on the parking lot .
we also had to do it in the parking lot of time , we were going to feel a part of the <unk> .
and then then he was sending us an email with saying : &quot; for first time i &apos;ve drawn something for seven years .
i &apos;ve got my feeling , i was pushed underneath water , and finally someone got up up up and knocked my head up and knocked my head up so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that holds us in the room and it &apos;s always going to continue to develop .
and we need to improve much more about this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a very much <unk> .
and somebody who has such a potential potential , deserves much more .
so we are doing it , trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since this time we &apos;ve got all sorts of recognition .
we won some awards .
consider it , it &apos;s free , no one of us deserves it .
it comes from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong was talking about us and then , december , this is an honor for us to be one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really neat .
and the <unk> of this is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that this april , in the inner-city city of los angeles , in downtown los angeles , will show an exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> &quot; &quot;
and there are probably the toughest practitioners of the <unk> present -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- all these boys are going to be there .
so , <unk> will be part of the show , which is fairly selfish .
so basically , i &apos;m saying : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , this microphone , the microphone -- all was impossible .
do it possible -- all here .
i &apos;m not a programmers and never had anything to do with a <unk> , but i &apos;ve just collected something and i was surrounded with amazing people so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should ask each of you , every single day where you think about something that needs to be done . if not now when i do , and if not i , who ?
thank you .
so i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably probably in america &apos;s most likely .
and i always say people i don &apos;t want to come from as a scientist .
you can have an farmers as farmers , or leather , but nobody has ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , a enlightenment , it &apos;s usually something that you find is because you &apos;ve left somewhere .
you &apos;re about the block and it &apos;s it as revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of i want to tell you today .
my circle began in the &apos; 60s in high school in <unk> , ohio where i was the <unk> .
i was one who was beaten every week in the <unk> green and blue , until a schoolteacher saved my life .
she saved my life by taking me the toilet in the <unk> .
they did actually secretly .
they did it three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it struck me after san francisco in california -- i found a lover in the &apos; 80s -- and then i found it really important to take a job of <unk> .
about three or four years ago i received a call from this teacher , woman who said , &quot; i must see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned to know each other as adults .
can you come to ohio please please , and please come together with the guy i know they &apos;ve been found in now .
and i should mention i &apos;ve got a <unk> , and i want you to ask yourself . &quot;
now , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them up , and we were taught us , and we gave them eight , and we gave them eight because it was necessary .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted me to learn as adults , i knew she turned into a box full of ashes and became my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , was closed , and the revelation i talked about was .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that &apos;s needs to do .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is just mentioned here .
it needs the same -- it needs , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you go up to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a power engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this sounds fear .
well , i had an unique place on this day ; i sat on <unk> .
i was the only person could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine already , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot has the machine on the hudson river .
this is usually not the route .
it turns out that floats turn out .
imagine a <unk> aircraft .
and then he said three words -- the gay words i ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to be . &quot;
i had to talk to the <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror , life was to end .
i want to share three things that i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people who i wanted to pass a hand and didn &apos;t do it , all the fences that i wanted to do and never did .
while i thought about it later , i got a phrase one saying , &quot; i collect bad wines .
because if the wine is so far , and the person is there , then i open it .
i never want to move more things in life .
and this urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and this was when we were the george washington bridge , it &apos;s pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really thought .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to get better to get better , everything i &apos;m going to do .
but i &apos;ve given my ego , i &apos;ve given my ego .
and i &apos;m doing the time that i wasted things for most of these things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people .
and then after that , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i haven &apos;t been a little bit more with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and during the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please stop in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , like you know it from documentaries .
while we all crash , i had this feeling , man , not quite terrifying .
almost like we prepare for our lives for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness is really in a thought , because i just want to do one thing .
i wish i could see my children grow up .
about one month later i visited a gig of my daughter -- <unk> , not much more harrowing talent ...
don &apos;t .
and i &apos;m going to cry , i &apos;m not like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was made for me .
i realized that i was able to realize the dots together that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than everything else , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
i was seen miracles that day not dying that day .
i received another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and come back and to live .
my call all of my call all that flies today is : imagine that this thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t please -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do that you put it because you think you would always be there ?
how would you change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents who can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is quite easy .
we don &apos;t want to build the bomb .
the most important point there is the development of nuclear weapons in the field of nuclear weapons .
the gray boxes that you see here is the <unk> .
if we &apos;re doing now to <unk> the systems that control the pressure and valves , we can actually create lots of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we create it that an effective model of a laptop system is used by a <unk> device to get this gray box , we are in business .
and this is the planning behind the .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> are flowing into the gray box , destroying the centrifuge and iranian <unk> <unk> .
this is a piece of cake , or ?
i want to tell you how we found this .
when we started our research to six months ago , six months ago , completely unknown what sense of meaning and purpose was this .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most uplifting part , the most part , he made a bunch of thousands of <unk> <unk> failures .
and it seemed like a little bit of a little bit of things , with these gray boxes , this <unk> .
so this is what our attention and we started a very <unk> project where we were with our environment with <unk> infected and studied this construction .
and then something weird happened .
so , <unk> about a <unk> that couldn &apos;t love our cheese -- <unk> on it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
this didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i was focused on that this was an emergency attack .
fully focused on a specific target .
the <unk> <unk> has active on the gray box around the box , if one particular configuration was discovered , even when this particular program , which is trying to infect it on this goal .
and if not , then nothing does nothing .
so , this really seemed my interest , and we started working on this , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , an infectious american power plant , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should find better figure out what the goal is .
so we &apos;ve got <unk> and we found out that it &apos;s emerging in two digital warheads -- a smaller and bigger .
and we also noticed that they were very professional , from people who had all available information to all the information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that had had to attack .
probably they had the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve noticed that the <unk> of the <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> are science for themselves .
it &apos;s much harder than anything we ever saw .
here &apos;s a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks pretty much like selfish <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart in this code .
so what we looked at first was <unk> <unk> , because we know what that cause .
and then we looked for <unk> and <unk> and tried to bring them to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we took these things that we had to do or prove to these goals .
so to do these theories , we call ourselves in memory that it definitely has to be a <unk> goal , it needs to act around a very precise goal , and it &apos;s probably true in iran because there &apos;s most infections there .
well , in this area there isn &apos;t several thousand goals .
basically it runs out to the <unk> nuclear power and the <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m going to give me a list of all experts experts on the world &apos;s favorite and power power from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up and <unk> her to compare her expertise to compare what we &apos;ve found in code and we found out in the data .
and this worked very good .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this mechanical rig , you actually can actually fill the rotor to the rotor and eventually they explode .
so what we found out is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it slowly and refined -- obviously , trying to avoid <unk> , so they couldn &apos;t be able to get quickly behind it .
the great digital digital science -- we got a glimpse by looking very precisely data and <unk> .
so for example , number of neurons are very much out of this code ; you cannot overlook it .
i started doing science literature , and what they did was built in <unk> , and found out that they are built in so-called <unk> , and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so this made sense , put it together .
and it was better .
these <unk> in iran are divided in 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
almost almost very common structure .
so again , this fits really well .
and this gave us great confidence for that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , not just like that .
these results were achieved through several weeks of hard work .
and often we just ran into a end and we had to collect us .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads are actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
and the little bit of the little bit takes takes a <unk> , and they &apos;re throwing the rotors and slowed it up and the big <unk> starts with six oxygen tests with six oxygen tests .
so , in large and all we are very optimistic that we actually have determines what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t need to worry that other goals could be accomplished by the <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- did really baffled me .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and it &apos;s the dark box on top .
now , what this thing is causing that it is causing the forces of sensors -- so for example of <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s providing <unk> code that &apos;s still working on the wrong round data .
and indeed , this false skylights &apos;s data has taken from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> has fed with <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
and the idea here is obvious , obviously , not only that <unk> in the room control .
in fact , there &apos;s much dangerous and more comfortable .
and the idea is to cheat a digital computer model .
we need digital <unk> there where a human <unk> cannot respond to enough .
so , for example , in a power plant , for example , if the big heat bubble gets to quickly , you need to open up in milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human <unk> .
so this is where we need digital <unk> .
and if you &apos;re risk , then really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither of the <unk> , nor the <unk> will be aware .
this is frightening .
but it gets even worse .
and what i say is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power plant or a plant plant .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t need -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t need to put the <unk> down to a <unk> stick , as we &apos;ve seen it at the <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a <unk> <unk> .
this is the consequence that we need to ask .
so unfortunately unfortunately , the largest number of goals isn &apos;t in the middle east .
they are in the united states , europe and japan .
so all these green areas are these green environments .
we need to ask us the consequences and we &apos;re getting better ready to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , there was a lot of them reported that people think that the <unk> is the <unk> behind .
is that yours ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s involved in the <unk> , but the driving force isn &apos;t israel .
so the driving force behind is the most primitive superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- happiness , happiness .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
thank you that you have a <unk> <unk> . thank you ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years to place me in situations that normally really difficult and even dangerous .
i went into prison -- difficult .
i worked in a <unk> game -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with nothing that &apos;s going to be here -- fun at the beginning , a little bit hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually exposed to the most part of my career of my career , and all of all for trying to investigate , and what they &apos;re really interesting , and i hope to try to understand some ways that they &apos;re doing for the audience and accessible .
so when i knew i would come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would make something different .
some of you may have heard about it , i was a ad in ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to get the <unk> in my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never never let me get a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence that would be a bit of a bit of a chance -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never never let me get a lot of content .
so what you got was : your name here is : my tedtalk , i don &apos;t know what the subject will be , and they would ever take them out to the ears for all the way i had to take her for their participation .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity to do it .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
lots of lots .
this is just the <unk> .
despite this warning , i knew anyone would buy the <unk> .
if you asked me this a year ago , i couldn &apos;t have been able to say to you about this .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone into some fairly terrible situations over the course of the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be done on anything that hard and so dangerous as you get with these guys .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; called &quot; &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the most enterprising <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything , from the beginning to down , from the beginning to end , completely with a brand -- from the <unk> that you see in the film , that &apos;s the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people are connected to the film in eternity forever .
and so the film will investigate this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity forever ?
i &apos;m a very liberating person .
that was more to the emphasis .
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have x as a <unk> , but we &apos;re going to ensure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the film .
so we might sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that they ever had ...
the greatest car that they ever were out of &quot; the most important <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink you ever had , a attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , actually , to get them to get them to finance ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all this film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of flowers .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to be happy if you would help to get this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how more well-meaning people will be .
have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective , because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how that will be developing ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth some of a very much one thing that really had really known brands .
if the movie comes out , we may see like a bunch of <unk> .
what do you think about how the answer is ?
and the answer is probably probably probably &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing about this movie or a hard thing about me ?
jk : both .
so ... means not so optimistic .
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands do .
yeah .
if you look at people who they have to do it ...
there are some places that we can apply .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out that it meant , &quot; we want to do anything with your film . &quot;
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising is to present your product as many people as possible , it as many people can see as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this interface of new and old media and the media media media -- isn &apos;t the idea of being in this new exciting environment that the masses is taking this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but see , the problem was that my idea had a mistake , and this was this .
no , no , no mistake was not the mistake .
this would have been no problem whatsoever .
this would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you &apos;re doing transparency at the online world , this is one of the first pictures that seems like .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
this was the problem : transparency -- unencumbered by deception and <unk> , simple and <unk> , just understandable ; characterized by <unk> and access to information , especially , what &apos;s going on -- the last line is certainly the greatest problem .
you know , we &apos;re hearing lots of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president tells us , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to that it &apos;s going to be implemented , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear , still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole dish &apos;s cool food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we want you to tell our story . &quot;
see when i was a kid and my dad caught me on lying -- and there he &apos;s sitting on looking at me and looked at me with this look -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so you see , with this film we wanted to tell the true version .
but there only one company , an agency was willing to help us -- and just because i knew john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , i had to go to the <unk> and go right with my team .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand will understand , a broad problem .
i have friends that are big , gigantic <unk> , and i have friends that little bit of like i do .
and my friends , the big , enormous <unk> , say that the reason why their films are so successful , the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends , they do little <unk> , &quot; well , how shall we compete with this big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the film called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how do we see them ban in the movie ?
whenever i do my journey , and always when i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see them <unk> .
and every time i put somebody else , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ? you see a little bit nervous .
i want to help you to calm yourself .
so you should have a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of this great <unk> .
either &quot; impotent fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , you &apos;ll have choice .
we are being equipped both for men as women -- solid , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can all answer your questions and give you a more profitable version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as they &apos;ve talked about these smaller films , we are a <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget as different brands .
so do these things -- you know , people are reminded of ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what words would you describe to describe ?
ban is <unk> .
this is a great question .
woman : <unk> technology .
technology isn &apos;t the way you describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the business .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes a positive , unlike &quot; smell smell and moisture . &quot;
it holds you fresh .
how can we hold them fresh -- better fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh , three times more fresh .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what is with me ? what is the <unk> ?
i must talk to the man on the street , which are like me , <unk> .
they should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really love beautiful clothes .
i mean , &apos; &apos; 80s is true , except at the <unk> .
well , what is the brand ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i &apos;ve got is probably &quot; glamorous glamour . &quot;
i like lots of black colors , lots of <unk> and such stuff .
but normally i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and such stuff .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , &quot; <unk> fly .
i &apos;m not sure , partly partly yogi , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> throughout the country , worldwide .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> .
does this ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i &apos;m looking at the interface of glamour glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , somebody who really could help me understand what you call &quot; vagina monologues &quot; .
and so i found a company called olson <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to explore these <unk> .
if they could do it for those , they could help me .
you brought your pictures , yeah ?
i &apos;ve got this . the first painting is a painting my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that was connected with her thoughts and emotion about it .
these are people who shape my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live in -- like people around one around , the friends , the family , the family , the way you live life , the work and so .
all these things come from and start from one place , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to talk about .
next . this is the most beautiful day my life .
what is what context is about thinking and emotions about yourself ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about &quot; why &quot; &quot; why &quot; does it bring us ?
what is the <unk> ? where they are currently ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a bit more about them that aren &apos;t them .
what else do you have through ?
... this doesn &apos;t need to be afraid . in what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your bear .
yeah . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
there was lots of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> are two separate , but it has been <unk> sides -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand brand brand brand brand .
they &apos;re very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re afraid to avoid these elements , and they &apos;re actually going to make them up for themselves , and it &apos;s actually a <unk> .
what else brands act like this ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , wii , mini , mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are more brands of brands and more brands , these things coming and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand brand is quite a strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody would ask you to describe your <unk> , your favorite , how would you ?
you ? are you something that makes blood in your waste ?
or are they more likely to be ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , more optimistic , more conservatives ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh things like the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> like <unk> <unk> , agile and agile , profane , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are they mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditional , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate ?
are they reliable , stable , food , secure , ew , whether it &apos;s sacred , whether the dalai lama or <unk> ?
and over the course of the film we had more than 500 companies who got up and <unk> and no said &quot; no &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want anything to do with this film because they don &apos;t have control , no control about the finished product .
but then 17 <unk> , 17 <unk> who were willing to get on these control that wanted to do business with somebody so comfortable and playful as i , and then we &apos;re ultimately able to tell stories that we don &apos;t have had to support .
they &apos;re told us to tell the story of the world &apos;s story , like we &apos;re using the story of this film that you &apos;re using these days , to make the <unk> of the brain , both for advertising as well as films .
we went to sao paulo where they were banned .
in the entire city , there &apos;s no <unk> , no posters , no posters , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went in school school where companies were going to get their path into impoverished schools , in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback or where i had the highest success , those are where i interacted with things right .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they were <unk> the <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> the agencies , and said that agencies don &apos;t really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists right .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think is that people are asking that our experience .
and how did it mean ? what did it do ?
now , da the film was going to be launched by the film festival festival , we can see this .
loud <unk> was the debut in january , and since then -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of <unk> from this film .
this includes actually a period of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film wasn &apos;t .
there &apos;s no time on it . no one .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
well , then , the film has a very big increase .
and this isn &apos;t bad for a project , almost every single time we talked about , to give their customers , to make your fingers .
something i think i found is that if you take your chance to take risks that we put risks in these risks .
i think if you keep people from it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you &apos;re going to get your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re willing to get a profit on it .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people , no fear that they might be able to do .
finally , we should be afraid of we should be called fear .
we should put the bear into the cage .
welcome fear . hot you .
each one &apos;s very flexible spoon , we welcome to the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it takes us a little bit honesty .
and that was talking about honesty and transparency , my entire talk called transparency , &quot; was reporting to you from my good friends of <unk> , the $ <unk> for the $ high school dollars .
big data are transformed for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
<unk> presents &quot; hot &quot; welcome transparency &quot;
thank you .
now morgan , in behalf of transparency : what &apos;s happening right now with the $ $ cancer ?
this is a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check on my pocket , on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in high altitude of dollars to finance my $ cancer budget .
my name is <unk> .
i made some other days ago , i made some google , and i &apos;m going to do something with museums and art . my favorite ones that i &apos;m today today , i gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
lots of negotiation negotiations and stories , i can tell you , 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demonstration .
there &apos;s lots of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very easy with this slide and your access .
i grew up in india .
i was seen a great education -- i didn &apos;t get me -- but i had no access to museums and this artwork .
and then i went to visit these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried to do this longing -- art technology -- technology technology together with technology .
we then started a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to <unk> .
you can look around all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , called van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come up on two because of it .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and passionate .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open up the card , and jump out with a click .
there are they &apos;re like to get up to the end of the inner-city .
just further . much fun .
explore around .
thank you , but the best thing comes .
now i &apos;m before one of my favorite books , <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
now this is one of the pictures .
this is all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , you can click here -- but i click this right now .
this is one of the pictures that we &apos;ve made with the so-called <unk> .
so this image for example has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me : &quot; what do you get 10 billion ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can easily put very easily and <unk> .
you see some fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around around , and i realized that there is something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait for a moment , this sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the end , and realized slowly that these children actually put some together .
i worked a little bit , i spoke with some known in the met , and actually found out that this was a game called <unk> , where a duck is knocked on the <unk> .
apparently it was fairly popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to get really close to getting close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you a review , i &apos;m going to figure out what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one is going -- in a second .
let &apos;s start quickly at moma , again in new york .
another one of me , <unk> .
now , at the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what only if you want to see how van gogh would have created this masterpiece ?
you &apos;re in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite books in this image until i really &apos;m in the basket .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
each of you , everybody -- whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can launch and create your own museum -- from all these pictures can make your own collection .
just easy , they go into -- and i &apos;ve created this , it means the power of the <unk> -- you can do it .
this is &quot; the <unk> , &quot; in the <unk> .
you can put anything through it , your friends , and so a conversation starts about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , i think , finally , is the main thing that all the wonderful things here is not coming from google .
you come from my view from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and this was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to just be with this digital medium of art , and you &apos;re right online .
and the biggest question that i asked to ask me : &quot; did you make this experience to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer to it is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add to experience .
that &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a plot of your brain . your brain can be divided in two halves .
this is the left half that is the logical side , and then the right half that is intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the distribution of each hemisphere , we could measure your brain .
for example , this is somebody who &apos;s completely logically .
this would be somebody who completely intuitively intuitively .
now , where would you prioritize your brain ?
some of us may have chosen for one of these extremes , but i think that most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high level of <unk> that &apos;s at the same time .
it &apos;s not as if they are both exclusive or something .
they can be logically and intuitive .
and so i look like one of the people , together with most other experimental <unk> , which need a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time we need a good amount of intuition to do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and then look like it would be . and then we start developing our intuition .
basically they do the same .
so one of the intuitions that they developed over the years is probably that one thing can be just at the same time .
i mean , it can be strange to think about that one thing is at the same time at two different locations , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember seeing a kid playing a child playing on a <unk> .
he was still a toddler and not very good in it and it fell all the time .
but i bet that playing with the <unk> of a very valuable lesson , which is really hard things not just let you pass you and stay in a place .
and this is a great model model in the world , so long they don &apos;t have a <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> system because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little weird particles .
and if you play your particles , you &apos;re all kind of weird things -- how they &apos;re just flying through walls , or they can be at the same time in two different locations .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the status of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little little particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big day-to-day objects around us .
this didn &apos;t really enjoy my intuition , and maybe because i don &apos;t really play with particles as much as they do .
well , i sometimes games sometimes with them , but not very often .
and i haven &apos;t seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it .
because if all of these particles are from particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , wouldn &apos;t just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be like this .
so i would feel better with all of things , if we could show that they would be able to follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made me a few years ago , exactly that .
i created one .
this is the first object that you can see that was in the <unk> .
so what we see here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
here i &apos;ll get it something . we look right here in the center .
and here &apos;s a really big slide of metal here , and here &apos;s a very big inch .
so what we look at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s molded like a springboard and it &apos;s shaped over the edge .
so i made this thing in similar ways to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new <unk> , and for 100 hours of all these big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool hole and get the thing .
this thing has has the ability to be in the <unk> , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full lift ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the lift , i &apos;m going to get all kinds of weird things on , but then other people are going to go and i hear all these things because i didn &apos;t want to offend it with it , or frankly , they &apos;re not supposed to offend it .
so quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects are feeling like .
the <unk> for most potent objects are not only people , but also the light that seems to be on them and the wind that &apos;s over to you and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal evolves , we had had to get out all the <unk> out of the <unk> .
and then we did .
we got the light off , put it into a vacuum and <unk> all the air out and it &apos;s just the way to go through it , just in the lift , was the piece of metal , it was free to behave like it wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it really moves really strange .
instead of just simply there , it &apos;s just because it &apos;s like it was like this -- like this -- like this -- like this -- like a <unk> and together .
we could put a little push in it , we could make it up at the same time , not fully vibrate -- something which is allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what truly fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms from which piece of metal is still there and move the same atoms in the same time .
just to precise doctrines you agree .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
this means that every atom is at the same time in two different locations , which means that all of the piece of metal is in two different locations .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth me for all this year in the green room , because you &apos;re going to check this , the <unk> between one atom and this piece of metal is about just like the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at two different locations , this piece of metal in two different locations , why don &apos;t you ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you were at the same time , how would that feel ?
how would your mind circumvent your mind that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we put it out , the light of light and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the lift in fact just selfish objects that are in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected with everything .
well , this isn &apos;t quite right .
there &apos;s another more , it &apos;s even more deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all these things around them , literally define who they are . and this is the <unk> and weird quantum mechanics .
thank you .
i decided in 2007 in 2007 , i decided we should think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about how they live and work , they want to be able to choose to give them a chance to pick between at least one hand of different cities that are all in competition to get new residents .
we &apos;re far far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much worth that much more than it costs them .
so we could just be very easily with the world , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now , this sounds like absurd for you , if you never thought about new cities .
they just trade the building of homes against the cities .
imagine half of people who want to live in homes , they did already , but they don &apos;t even do it .
they could try to extend the capacity of these available apartments .
but you know what you would be willing to be able to do in these homes and their environment to avoid grievances and avoid their own .
so it turns out as hard to meet all of these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new block block , provided the laws there would support such an operation and not empowering it .
so i suggested that governments create new surfaces that provide enough place for a city , and given them a name : <unk> cities .
i found out that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of reform reform .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 <unk> , they had to leave her country to get into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same state in honduras .
in this point , <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to go into a very much area of our country , what if we just go into a message of the american message , one part of the canadian rules , and if people would do to work on the canadian rules or the united states , what they &apos;re going to do to do in canada or america ? &quot;
in 2009 , honduras was honduras under severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> in a turnaround that i promised for new zealand as well as well .
he challenged to be his <unk> .
meanwhile , i did myself in a talk at tedglobal .
and try and try and try and try and try this complicated concept of the <unk> city of the entire city of the entire entire chemical concept .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you &apos;ve already not allowed to have any existing doctrines .
we pay attention to new technologies , but for progress , it needs technologies and laws , and they are usually laws that kept us remembered .
in the fall 2010 , a friend from guatemala sent to the hook .
and then then he showed him <unk> .
they were called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present this the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met at december in december of a hotels in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make clear that is valuable cities to be more valuable than they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york . think that one area in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per meter of dollars .
but it was a fairly abstract debate , in a place where there was a pause , has said , &quot; paul , could we look at this tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk introduced in very simple form that a <unk> city is a place where it &apos;s beginning to land in the beginning of the country , a <unk> that determines the laws that are there and provide the ability to make either these rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of honduras , who said that we &apos;ve got to make this project that it matters , and that this is important to bring our country .
i was asked to get <unk> , and i was going to hold on the fourth and fifth january january .
so i &apos;ve given another thing with some of some of the chart like this includes a graphic , trying to prove that if you want to create lots of value in a city , it needs to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in <unk> .
alone , it has a land of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of trying to make a new city , you have to start with at least 1,000 types of <unk> .
this is more than 250 acres .
polite have all the <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very seriously and attention .
the head of congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you for a talk for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i got him on my laptop here . &quot;
i got down , and you put this tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city offers new ways .
there were the opportunity to live in a city that were honduras in honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away from north .
and a new city includes new ways for leaders with a .
the leaders of the government were honduras for aid , they could be able to benefit from their <unk> , which they &apos;re doing in the power of law and how we can help help that everyone would trust that everyone would be able to get out of the charter .
and the realization of president <unk> was that the faith of the most uplifting thing i thought was thinking about as a path to get the foreign investors to build this city for all parties for all parties for all the parties who have been suffering from all of years .
we &apos;re in an area .
this image is from this place .
it makes a thousand miles miles .
and shortly after this , january , you &apos;ve voted in the constitution for a <unk> change that is for special <unk> .
in a country that has just been a violent crisis , in congress was elected for this <unk> for this <unk> to a voice .
all parties , all the public health , supported this .
in order to become part of the constitution , it has to be authorized by congress .
on february 17th , it was authorized to be authorized to a voice .
immediately after this choice , between the 21 and 24 24 , a delegation of about 30 <unk> of the world in the world , who were most interested in the business store in the business store .
one place is south korea .
this is an image from a big , new downtown center , built in south korea , big as the center of the center .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years , after it took four years to get the permissions .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism , singapore is singapore .
there were already built two cities in china and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s what we stand today .
they already have a <unk> ; and they already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on an judicial system that <unk> allows you to be able to be able to be able to be able to work on an external system .
there &apos;s already offered to provide his supreme court as court for the most optimistic system for the <unk> law .
also , <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even get funding with one .
one thing , as you know , realized , there &apos;s lots of <unk> .
there are many studies that would like to be in america especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who loved living there .
there are 700 million people around the world , saying that they would like to live continuously in a different place .
one million people leave another latin america every year .
many of them are fathers who are forced to meet their families to get work in their own work , sometimes there are single mothers who have needed enough money to make food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes sometimes sometimes kids are kids who are trying to find their parents that they were in some cases in some cases , in some cases , in some cases , no longer have seen .
so what is it for an idea to think about thinking about this is to build a whole new city ?
or even more <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea of being that every family has a choice between tens of cities that are in competition to have new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends &apos; friends &apos; parents were asked me to say thank you .
you know how many decisions do you make it on a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently did a survey with 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that are actually a typical american american american one day is <unk> .
and also recently recently created a study with ceos where they saw a week of the people .
and these scientists , just these different themes that are going to be focused on this ceo , and how much time they were doing decisions that relate to these issues .
and they found that an average ceo goes on with <unk> tasks .
each of these topics were of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were paid within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions they needed an hour or more of your time .
think about your own decisions .
you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of a few minutes of a time ?
how good , think , are you doing decisions about it ?
today i want to talk about one of the most important <unk> of modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise you because i &apos;m blind , just your hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , i ask you a question , and your answer yes , so , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear anything about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a university professor at stanford university , i went to this very very heart convenience , at least at time he was really exclusive .
it was a bin laden called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and this was at a time we &apos;ve actually discontinued .
i loved loved this business , but at one point i asked me , well , how does it get something wrong ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different ways of olive olive olive olive olive oil , including those who came into boxes that came from thousands of years old .
so i decided to visit the branch page one day , and i asked the director , &quot; works this model that you really really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the accumulation of tourists that came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose to do our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gear .
they had a different species of <unk> .
we put a little <unk> right back into the entrance .
we &apos;ve got six different flavors of tastes , or 24 different flavors , and we put on two things : first , i would have more people stand up and try to try to try ?
there are more people standing when it was 24 percent than if it was six percent , about 40 percent .
and then we saw ourselves in which is the case that people bought a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and people were sitting there than they were 24 , bought only three percent of actually a glass .
and from the people who were six , and we were six percent of them actually bought a glass of glass .
now , if you do it , they bought six times more , who had six times to give them six to the selection when they had 24 to the selection .
now , not to buy a glass of glass , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that that &apos;s what we &apos;re affecting us with very stereotypical decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it goes against our own best interests .
so the subject of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m experimenting with <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we &apos;re doing decisions for almost a million americans from about 500,000 plans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> that were possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be saved if more for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a context .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that offered people anything between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that the increasingly becoming less than that was becoming low .
if you look at the extremes , the plans that offered two fund , had a <unk> in the 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that offered almost 60 fund , the <unk> would have been on about the <unk> .
now turns out that even if they were concerned about the time they were able to be able to judge , even then it has negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to be more likely to have more opportunities , the more they &apos;re unemployed and they are spending education .
the more opportunities were available , the more they were in just the whole money in just the whole money .
none of these extreme decisions is that they heard about decisions that someone &apos;s dignity if you care about their future financial well-being .
now , for the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three crucial negative consequences that are helping them more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push them up , even if it &apos;s going to your own best interest .
they &apos;re more likely decisions -- worse financial decisions and worse decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to make things that you feel less comfortable , even if you make an objective better .
and the main reason for this is that we might enjoy this big shelving filled with these enormous shelves of <unk> , mustard and <unk> and <unk> , but we actually couldn &apos;t pick the compare and replicate something from the fantastic service .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different ways in different ways -- they can just apply in your business .
first of all , narrow .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that less is .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; close . &quot;
they always worry that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
but in fact , we &apos;re more and more and more , that if they &apos;re willing to narrow them , and the <unk> <unk> are going on , and then there &apos;s a increase of sales , they &apos;re going to be lowered by the cost , and there &apos;s a improvement in the cost .
as a <unk> and gamble the various filters and gamble of 12 infections , they &apos;ve got a increase by reducing 10 percent .
when the golden corporation sold her 10 at the worst school company , i guess it was 87 percent of <unk> -- a result of both , the increase in sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average capital company today is today gives you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart wal-mart gives you 100,000 products today .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is today &apos;s supermarket in the world today is <unk> , and they &apos;re just giving them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato tomato sauce .
now in the world of the world , i think one of the best examples that recently came on the marketplace , how you &apos;re best learning choices , was something that david was very strong with the david <unk> has a program that &apos;s offered harvard .
every harvard employees takes automatically in a part of a part .
and those who really want to meet choice is not offered to be 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i should just be .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the unemployed question is , &quot; say me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if they don &apos;t get your employees to do it , it cannot be your customers . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be ready to offer all people in this audience to offer a <unk> holiday to the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you .
and now i give you a few seconds around you and then i ask them to clap if you &apos;re willing to embrace gary &apos;s offer .
okay . everybody who is willing to embrace gary &apos;s offer .
are this all ?
okay , let me show you something more about it .
you knew it was a trick , or ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that &apos;s what you looked at attention , the first time more information had more information than the second time , but i would make it a chance that you felt it in the second time .
because the pictures had made it experience .
what makes me do to the second technology that helps you with the problem of climate change , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between opportunities , understanding what consequences are associated with individual possibilities , and that consequences are given vivid and specific ways .
why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more if you use a <unk> or a card card than talking about ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you &apos;re making people saving more .
so we &apos;ve made a study that i &apos;ve been with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve made a study with the people in <unk> -- employees who &apos;ve been working on all the work for the work -- and these people were all in a session where they &apos;ve signed their participation for their teammates .
and during this session , we &apos;ve got these meetings exactly as she was , we &apos;ve added a little bit of a little bit .
the thing that we &apos;ve got to do is we &apos;ve been asking people to think of all positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
we did this simple thing , there was a increase of participation around 20 percent , and there was a increase of the number of people who were willing to save or an increase around four percent of the amount that they were ready for the drug target .
the third technology : <unk> .
we can do better than more categories than more anxiety .
here &apos;s example , one study that we &apos;ve made in a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> down in the northeast direction , the numbers between the <unk> of magazines to <unk> magazines .
but do you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and you &apos;re going to show you about 10 categories or i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , and they &apos;re going to do this in 20 categories , you think i gave them more choices and better better than i gave you about five .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
here are two different types of pollen .
one called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other called &quot; jazz . &quot;
if you think that the left display is <unk> , and the ad on the right is jazz , they put them into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s some .
if you think that on the left jazz , and the one on the right side is , you &apos;re clapping .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz and the on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is highly inclusive of highly inclusive .
the categories must say something that is not that the choice is providing .
and this problem often often see if you look at the long bullet points all of these fund .
who do you want to get informed ?
my fourth technology : assumption for complexity .
it turns out that we can circumvent more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> , which gives you the opportunity to get your car completely .
they have to meet 62 different decisions to make your car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that provide them every choice .
<unk> , <unk> of cars -- i &apos;ve got 56 ways .
engines , gear -- four possibilities .
what i do now is , i change the order of decisions .
half of customers are going to be about many ways , 56 , <unk> , for low possibilities , four gear .
the other half of customers are about low ways , four gear , to the 56 , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interests they are .
if they &apos;re constantly using the decision , that means that they &apos;re overwhelmed , the <unk> , i lose it .
what you find out is that the people who are going to get from the small <unk> , and keep the <unk> .
we lose them .
go from the little bit of choices to many , then you keep it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of opportunities .
the only thing i did is the order to be able to do this information .
if i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning like i &apos;m going to do .
even even though the gear is picking , i don &apos;t get anything about my preferences in the interior , i still keep me to pick it up .
it also puts me on a excitement about the big product i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m willing to make me motivate me to be interested in being interested .
let me wrap up .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that are the problem of the problem -- narrow -- they &apos;re going to go up the most profitable alternatives ; they -- they &apos;re doing it real ; we can do better with more categories , less ways .
each of these techniques i &apos;m explaining to you today is to help you change the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people who they offer service .
because i think that the key to the best choices is that you &apos;re picky to pick them .
and the more we are picking up , and the better we will be able to make the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> . i &apos;m looking at a professionally .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos become <unk> , and then that &apos;s why that &apos;s important .
we all want star -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- comedians -- when i was young , it seemed like infinitely hard .
but <unk> has enabled us that we all will be fully famous or all our creative activities , in part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet until next saturday .
but there are more than 48 hours uploaded to 48 hours of video .
it &apos;s only a tiny percentage ever over it , and then thousands of times has looked at and so the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> , this video he was photographed in front of his house in yosemite park .
in 2010 , there was 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like this was going to be popular for the first time the video last summer .
he didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do this that if you &apos;re a yosemite mountain car .
he had uploaded each amount of pressure .
and this video was actually been sent in january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> : the tweet that was going to be so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy , you ask ourselves new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> down on <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , i hope we would have this conversation .
rebecca is a &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times looked at this year .
this is what the graph looked like .
just like &quot; double <unk> &quot; seems to be done from nowhere .
what happened on this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what is this day , this particular friday ?
now , <unk> <unk> it up , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson was the first one who did with twitter about this .
so important is that an individual or a group of <unk> had taken out of a single audience , divided with a big audience and accelerated .
then this community formed from people who shared this big <unk> , and started talking about it and just playing it .
now there are 10,000 times of &quot; <unk> &quot; in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single week .
unlike the 20th century entertainment century , the public sector is our path to be able to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from it .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
this is , just easy .
this year was almost 50 million times looked .
and if you keep this crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> that has four million times looked at .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
it &apos;s important , creativity that are in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
there was yeast .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole piece of <unk> shot from the ground that made it from a silly joke to something that we &apos;re all participating on .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure of something , we &apos;re doing .
who could have crossed this ?
who would have &quot; double <unk> &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot;
what do you have done to write in which kind of stuff that would do ?
in a world where every minute two days of video is uploaded , only unique and unexpected <unk> , like that wrote videos .
i admit i wasn &apos;t really interested in my friend , i should look at this fabulous video , about a guy who vis-a-vis the new york against the ticket .
i got a ticket , because i didn &apos;t go on the <unk> , but often there are disability that will not make a decent problem on the <unk> .
because this was entirely surprising and humorous , casey &apos;s funny idea and his argument was about five million times .
this approach is true for all new things we do .
and all of this leads us to a big question ...
what does this mean ?
<unk> .
what does this mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access and audiences .
like said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning to youtube .
no one has to give your ideas green light .
and today we &apos;re all about ourselves as an editor of our culture culture .
and these are not the features of the old media and they don &apos;t even meet the media of today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about three generations about three generations , and how the astonishing strength of this connectedness in life of a four-year-old girl , when she was sitting in a little bit of the little girl &apos;s life , and a party who was living in san francisco , and a party that was living in san francisco .
history isn &apos;t over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still composed .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s going to burn his life &apos;s work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was introduced by the simple hope of the simple hope of the simple hope of the simple hope of the simple hope of its own .
hold on the <unk> of the <unk> in front of the <unk> , as he must admit that his life was a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , <unk> .
he moved back into silence .
he died , broken through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten me life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t been free , and it was my job , learning that history was trying to do us , we &apos;ve gone out of it , we &apos;ve gone out .
the next thing is showing you how a boat in the early <unk> <unk> at sea .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- ever in a marriage trip , with two little girls .
for she had her job , this was the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that they could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> , a boat &apos;s sitting on the lake as an indian indian .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the most fear had them before pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was a little bit of <unk> .
if you had a child health , i would have my sister and i then drink my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- this is making the motor flow of motor , this is a little bit on the front of a wave , the high and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirate that came up many times , but they were missing from the <unk> of men on our boat , or on the motor of the motor that didn &apos;t want six hours .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> of the north coast , and the young man who collapsed collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and at the taste of the first <unk> that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever tasted again .
after three months in a refugee camp we landed in melbourne .
and the next one is about four women in three generations that build together new lives together .
we let us fall down , one of the ancient oceanographic suburb , whose population is from <unk> .
unlike the most violent , their existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> .
the smell of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> were brought between people who had one thing together : they started .
my mother worked on farms on farms , then on one line of the assembly line in a <unk> , six days , twice .
it somehow managed to find the time to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar was given and became more education for english and math , whatever we had to do , but mostly the new things that came from second hand .
two few weeks of school for school , every to address the holes in the other .
one of the <unk> to the <unk> because she had to pass six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and here , &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
go home where ?
something else is in mine .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of this path . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other of our day , and they heard the movements of our grandmother &apos;s .
my mother suffered from the boat .
and it was my job to stay every night until her got back to her <unk> , so i could be able to do it .
she opened a <unk> , then took a <unk> and opened a business .
and women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t get the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and donors were searching .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one was the classic asian student , the <unk> demands of themselves .
in the other one was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence carrying the <unk> and insulation .
but many received over the years .
and because of this aid i was been launched in my last year as young <unk> of the year .
and i was <unk> from one village to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous <unk> of <unk> , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who had never heard about places , and in homes , who never heard themselves .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to speak about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to routine and my own comfort of life of a unknown life -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters that told every day of her day as 20 years , by telling each other the stories of their day and told each other of them .
i said my mom , i wouldn &apos;t do this .
she remembered me that i was so old as she was when we climbed the boat .
no was never been a possibility .
&quot; do it easy &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and training , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all sorts of food , so many of them did what they loved living in the limitations of possible .
and although i graduated from my degree , i realized i couldn &apos;t meet with a career in law law .
there had had to be another more <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a outsider , a <unk> , new in the image -- and not just okay , but something that you must be grateful for , maybe a gift of the .
because it can make it easy to collapse for fixing tissue , can mean that you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve been enough from my research program to know that , yes , the world , but not as you &apos;re doing it .
possibilities that couldn &apos;t have been allowed , profoundly encouraged .
there was a energy , a optimism optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people around me , for the <unk> , &quot; not a very much challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a dime for year .
at the end of one night i was cooking a huge jar of soup we shared .
we worked late late .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant , and we were able to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the united states .
after just one journey there .
my gut gut gut again .
three months later i was moved and the adventures went on .
before i &apos;m going to talk about the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the <unk> , the social norm and wellness was the most important person .
life has not changed for centuries .
her father died soon after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
i was told her the second woman woman who she suggested her .
without support her husband &apos;s husband was asked for a <unk> by a <unk> , and she was in her own case , and even more more than it was left .
&quot; isn &apos;t &quot; proving himself as false .
i just got a hotel room in sydney when she died . 800 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and looked at the other side .
i knew she was coming to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes after it .
a few days later we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her coffin .
we told her stories and they were told that we were still in her .
after midnight , the monk came and said he had to finish the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch your hand .
she asked the monk : &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she has been present tomorrow today , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t put it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a ligament in our family , it &apos;s about women .
you see who we were and how life has been molded us , we can see that the men who might have come into our lives , would have been given us into the <unk> .
that would have been too easy .
now i would like my own children , and i &apos;m thinking about the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , just like , just <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave of every wave , the <unk> , continuous <unk> of the motor , the wide horizon , which doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this this , and you could secure it , i would do it .
and also , mother &apos;s mother today is here in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because this is a picture that you can &apos;t capture with his camera .
but my interest on photography , when i got my first camera camera , at age 15 years .
i combined with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a bit different because using the camera was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture of a camera , the end of the process , when you press it on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more about making this on photography , at the right place at the right place .
i thought everybody could do this .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts to start when it gets pushed .
photos like this : an site , along a much more noisy road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and still , a realistic level .
or pictures like this -- dark and <unk> , but all with the shared goal to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean .
because , of course , it isn &apos;t something that you really can capture , but i want to make it look like if you could have this , on a photograph .
photographs , you have to think about a brief moment to find the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea , a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the detail or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but then all of the end of it is about how we interpret the world , and how it can make a two-dimensional material material .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think for realistic .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and make an alternative reality .
and let me show you just a simple example .
we &apos;ve got three perfectly perfect objects that we &apos;re all able to identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in some ways combined , you can create something that is still more three-dimensional as if it could be .
but at the same time we know that that isn &apos;t possible .
so we cheat our brains because our brains don &apos;t really feel that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
so the things that make an image look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about that are around us in our day-to-day life .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because you just look wrong .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to get a result of a result .
as you can see , they are not three special pictures .
but combined , you can do something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined with photographs of the same perspective .
secondly should have some of these kinds of things that have done .
and these two pictures meet these two demands -- from the same altitude shot and the same thing .
third is about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual pictures start and end by connecting it together .
it &apos;s impossible to say how this photograph was actually composed .
so by color , contrast and contrast , the edges of the individual pictures , photographic imperfections , like <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders , we &apos;re going to see the limitations between the different images and let &apos;s see a picture basically hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that &apos;s only a landscape , and the lower part was rigged .
but this image is actually completely composed of pictures of different locations .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t need to make trade-offs with the ideas in his head .
but it requires lots of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find them to find the different locations for the puzzle .
for example , fish was taken on a <unk> .
the shore comes from another place .
the <unk> comes from a quarry .
and yeah , i even put the house up on the island on the island to take away look look look look look at milk .
so to get a very much outcome , it &apos;s looking out from me from planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different pictures .
and here &apos;s a piece of very serious planned .
and then if you make good footage , it can be fairly beautiful , and quite realistic .
so they &apos;re all available tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i would love to talk to you why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think most important thing is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced in the field of the world was to be a <unk> .
and it &apos;s not quite scientifically scientifically scientifically , but it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and asked the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how do it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems of why everybody -- maybe most of the electronic forms fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite version . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
she has a button , it &apos;s a button .
and every morning i ever ever ever .
and yeah , i have a job as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve got my job for 95 pounds .
it &apos;s just just working : every time i get on the scale , you send my data on google health .
and there are also going to be from my <unk> , so he can recognize where my favorite is not just in the moment where i support support or so need , but also with a look at the past .
there &apos;s another thing .
maybe you know that , i &apos;ve got 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i went on my dorm room and people talk about me before i sit in car , &quot; for lunch , just a little lettuce a little lettuce . &quot;
but this is what can happen because this is the <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be able to solve patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and get them to play together together some kind of game to control better health .
it &apos;s coming up next week .
it will give this little bit of <unk> that you &apos;re going to do an iphone or so .
and it will enable people to measure your blood pressure , to send it to your doctor and share him with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
and at this point , the patients are going to play . they can &apos;t only take control of control , captain on your own ship , but we can help us health care in the face of health , and the health care system , and the health care system , and so on .
they do techniques that are easy to use and start with this to give patients in the team .
and they can do it through these ways , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things that we did , i want to share with you through a short video .
we all have the <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our phones .
we know exactly where all people cash machines are around around around .
we know even one where all stations are .
and yeah , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next one to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving <unk> was in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> organized in the netherlands .
we built a website and asked a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share them where he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during the <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 times , they were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find applications for this .
and we designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a <unk> , somebody jumps down , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can use your body pressure to save the next <unk> of life .
and we &apos;re not just like to do this as a product of what the product called it , but also introduce a <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from others , why to help us think about how to behave , to make these vectors of all around the world .
and if you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collapse , it would be your own familiarity or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies around the world is helping us for approval of these .
these might be <unk> , or technician , for example , just to ensure that the <unk> is still in its place .
please help us and try to do anything that don &apos;t only better better , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little bit of <unk> wants us to do our environment by using ...
... it gives a lot of familiarity .
here &apos;s a short video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it until it &apos;s load .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video ...
no .
this isn &apos;t ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is already over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago i launched a program called the star in technology and design to take back a year and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much everything they would hate , we &apos;ve got them work in the government .
the program called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> for kindness .
we pick some fellows every year and we &apos;re doing it with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into <unk> .
and there they developed amazing applications , worked with civic employees .
but what they really do is to show what today today is possible .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in town .
here it looks like he looks after a date , but what he really looks really is , is someone who &apos;s going to put him out when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> when it &apos;s a meter of snow .
how did he get to look for this special kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston called code for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of <unk> .
and they found that the city never <unk> these fire hydrant .
but one particular fellow , a man called erik <unk> , noticed something else and that was that residents were free sidewalks for the sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what every good engineers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you put it free to it , when it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do this , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic game .
this is a humble version app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest applications that have written for fellows last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other business .
it &apos;s expanding rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> of the city of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but so that citizens adopt the citizen of the citizen .
it &apos;s very important that these things work , but people steal the batteries .
so he received the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to use the citizens to use the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago has just introduced them to put people the <unk> , when it &apos;s <unk> .
we know nine cities , planning to use this app .
and she has over over , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that it usually doesn &apos;t usually .
the software software software takes a few years in the rule .
we had a team that worked last year in boston last year , for three years .
it was about a method that parents can find out what the right public schools are for their children .
we later told us that if it would be over the normal canals , it would have taken over two years and cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing nothing .
there &apos;s a project in california right now , which has been the taxpayer has gone two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that was written in a few days in a few days , and then it turns out from the <unk> , is a kind of shot on the front of the front of the .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like an personal enterprise , how many people think she should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather than the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and cleaning .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly on this app is that you represent a new generation that &apos;s the problem of the government -- not as the problem of an inclusive institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make tools that we need to do things effectively tackle .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows there are hundreds of people around all the country that gets up and write , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t quit the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these people know something we lost from your eyes .
and then that &apos;s when you all meet your feelings about politics and the line of the and all the other things that we really upset is is government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos; &apos; hero , &quot; what we do do . &quot;
today , lots of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please please , you know , you &apos;re going to do it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ultimately takes their force from us -- <unk> you : &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought it &apos;s mainly about the government to choose in office .
now after two years , i came to conclude that it &apos;s mostly in municipalities to go out .
this is the call call for service and information .
there you usually come out when you &apos;re going to get a <unk> in your city .
if you ever have the chance to work in your <unk> call call , like our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- indeed , you &apos;re all going to do this -- you &apos;re going to see that people who are calling the government for many different issues , including that a <unk> in your house .
scott gets this <unk> .
he &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see whether that livestock ? &quot;
and this worked . applause of scott .
but this wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston didn &apos;t just boston call a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
this is really smart people in the office of new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- i was in my favorite book , can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott complained to human .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public , so everybody can see .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we &apos;ve got , &quot; i went across there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yeah . alive ?
and then the <unk> turned on the page . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty easy .
this is great . here &apos;s digital digital digital physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is to get into this .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i mean not necessarily a technical definition of platform .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could have connect them with government services if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps to do it , we strengths our municipalities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
how often we chose political leaders -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to vote a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re hoping that the government , reflect our values , and then we expect that the government to reflect our values and then didn &apos;t change much ?
this is because the government is like a wider ocean and politics are the highest <unk> .
and what is underneath , what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s these contempt that we own , and for that we &apos;re paying for to be something that works against us , something else , and then we &apos;re going to do it .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual blast is happening .
we need to be on the machinery of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group concerned that has written a very fine-grained report report that has an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not political active , which is active active .
now , for those of us who have been given up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about it , about the world that we want to leave from our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really think we have to do what we need to do without improving an institution that can do all of us in behalf of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government fundamentally understood something that actually can do something by defending society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up on the internet internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you need to build really really systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m sadly , almost one generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with their voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight this fight that we &apos;re all fighting , who &apos;s allowed to talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you can feel your opinions , every single canal , and they do .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care about their voices .
they use your hands .
they use your hands to write applications that improves the work of the government .
and these applications are taking us our hands to improve our municipalities .
this could be a mobile hydrant , <unk> weed , a trash trash with a <unk> .
and certainly , we would have these mobile hydrant all of these hydrant , and many people do this .
but these applications are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who pay taxes and receive excellence .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve got here for you here : if it &apos;s about big , important things that we &apos;re going to do together , all together , we will only be a lot of voices , or we will be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role in understanding people how wonderful the new technologies that are at the beginning , are going to be on , and i thought i &apos;m going to do with my friends , i would tell you what i really really think , and try to understand what i really do .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single one , boring slide .
... if you show just a minute .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the detail of the slide , but rather about the general shape .
this slide shows data data analysis by the performance of <unk> processors to the performance of a <unk> area called networks .
and the interesting thing here is that this slide , like many others , which we often find in our field , sort of just a very simple curve .
in other words : each step here is a power in the <unk> .
and this is a novelty that we have to use this type of scale on the field of technology in technology .
something very weird happened here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you could turn your light back again .
another slightly brighter because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper .
now why draw we draw graphs in technology on <unk> curves ?
and the reason for this is if i would draw it on a normal curve , where we say , this is the years , so the timeline of a kind of , and this is an chemical amount of technology that i want to demonstrate with an graphs , it will be silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then this on the <unk> scale would be very rigid falling in a flat line .
but if something like this , it changes the most important circumstance .
so if the price of the price of the speed of the time , we could get a taxi ball into a taxi and we were in tokyo .
but this isn &apos;t so quickly .
this was never before in history , this kind of <unk> growth , which is the scale of all the years .
so the question i want to ask you is if you look at these exponential curves , you &apos;re going to see you don &apos;t go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever , forever , quickly as quickly as it has .
there are two ways .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic <unk> like here , to something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
this is in about .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
so this is really that , then that means , we &apos;re here in a transition right here .
we &apos;re on this line here , in a transition from the world in a transition from the world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state of thinking about the world ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a year somewhere in 2000 and people talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still 2000 .
we don &apos;t go on .
so in other words , the future has gone every year for me for this world .
i think the reason for this is that we realize that there is something happening .
the transition happens . we can all feel .
and we know that there &apos;s simply no sense to try to see 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything else will be so different that a simple amount of view of what we &apos;re doing now simply not a sense .
i want to talk about what this could be , this transition where we &apos;re right now .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really nothing about technology or computers .
because i think really really understand this , we need to go back and look at this one step at a longer time .
and i want to look at this on the world &apos;s life of life .
i think this big picture makes sense when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and we &apos;re two billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with many of them .
now if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a very good picture about how they do the <unk> .
i think there are theories that are starting to understand how everything has started rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a dumbed-down story about this time , which is that time small <unk> of <unk> that &apos;s given different kinds of chemicals for chemicals .
some of these <unk> combined with some combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and grow so growing .
all these were , we were making .
these little <unk> were the <unk> <unk> .
but these doctrines weren &apos;t about alive in today &apos;s sense because every single one was only a small , <unk> recipe for chemicals .
and every time it divided , they have combined into disparate amounts of these chemicals .
so every one was a little different .
actually , the <unk> , which had a <unk> chemical composition faster than others and integrated more chemicals from outside and divided faster .
so these tend to survive longer , and they were in a more vulnerable degree .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if this is what these <unk> is learned about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t understand , these things are learned to be learned to make information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical shape , which we call dna .
in other words , they &apos;ve found in this <unk> , evolutionary way that allowed them to make what they made , so that this information could be stored and copied that information .
and the amazing thing about it is that this kind of information is going to flow over two billion years where they were developed , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and every living is using the same letters and the same code .
we are far that we &apos;re just going to be able to write on the code of the code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 sets of <unk> here , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from <unk> .
it &apos;s a place that i did -- i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is from normal letters that we use to use the <unk> -- and i wrote my research on a piece of dna , and i did 10 ^ 22 .
so if somebody wants to have a hundred million copies of my favorite , i &apos;ve got enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a <unk> , i would have written it on a virus and released into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna system was an interesting step .
and the <unk> these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , which things were completely different , and so these cells began communicating and share information , so communities were created by cells .
i don &apos;t know whether you knew this , but bacteria can actually share their dna .
so that &apos;s why that &apos;s the consistency of antibiotics .
some bacteria found out how they can stay away from penicillin and put this information together with other bacteria in dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate each other .
now this communication allowed the reasons of communities , which in some sense were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survived together , or they went together . that meant that if a community was successful , all individuals in the community were more often repeated and more than evolution .
the <unk> is there where these communities are so close to that they decided to make the recipe for the whole community into a dna program .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point we &apos;ve got <unk> communities , communities of many of these kinds of <unk> , which act together as a single organism .
indeed , we are also a very common community .
we have lots of cells that no longer are available .
your skin cells are useless cells without heart cells , muscle cells , cells and so on .
so these communities started to be <unk> , so that the level , which evolution was happening , no longer was the single cell , but the whole thing that we call organism .
now the next step happened within these communities .
the <unk> began to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t do anything else as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that they &apos;ve built these <unk> .
they started educating in specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so they gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning happened within the span of a individual organism rather than about this evolutionary period .
so an organism could learn to eat a certain fruit because she did badly and made him sick , the last time he ate her .
now this could happen within the lifespan of one individual organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years was needed to learn from the individuals who died because these fruit were dying , because these food systems weren &apos;t there yet .
so the nervous system has the dna system using this particular seed system because evolution could be able to happen within an individual .
she could happen within a time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms was going to find a way to communicate each other .
so as example , the most enterprising , the most popular version of this system is human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention that if you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , <unk> and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically giving notes notes from me , hoping to create a similar idea of this kind of confused idea in your head that has some resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it lifts it into sound around , a sequence of sound , and make something very complicated in the minds of others .
so this allows us to work again as an unified organism .
and what we did , we have humanity , we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we went through the same stages , which have gone through the <unk> -- the aesthetic of our methods that we capture data .
the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , computer , <unk> , and so on , all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to manage this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we were so far .
so today today , evolution can happen in the period of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen a little bit of <unk> , where he showed some evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program , directly front of your eyes .
so we &apos;ve got the <unk> back again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , for some hundred million years .
then the most primitive steps , like language and so on , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem very few decades .
the process feeds itself from itself and becomes so , i think , <unk> is the word for it -- if something improves its <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this very noisy curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live professionally from building computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use to build computers , not use it without the progress done in computer science .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what designers do is doing , we think , we think , think on a certain sense , this machine , and the machine makes something that makes our skills far beyond , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it &apos;s partly with ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using recently , is evolution itself .
so we install a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
so to say , to an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that is developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , computer engineers have a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of instructions .
now please all of these randomly chosen instruction instructions , run all the programs , and finally , the ones that i &apos;m going to be on the next . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;m going to define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want numbers numbers , that would be a simple example of which i &apos;ve used for this .
so find programs that can be most likely to rank numbers .
of course , the chance of randomly chosen causes by randomly chosen numbers , you &apos;re just given numbers , so they don &apos;t get the instructions to do this .
but one of those likes to be lucky enough two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve got to the next .
store this down , <unk> the rest .
now , all of the <unk> that are the numbers are the best .
and it &apos;s with a method of <unk> , analogous to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children are the properties of the <unk> of the two programs .
so i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that emerged through combinations of programs that have come into the very vulnerable ones than others .
say , &quot; please again again again . &quot;
again , it .
maybe some mutations .
and try this again again with another generation .
all these generations are just few milliseconds .
and so i can go through an evolution over millions of years in a few minutes , or more more more more than some hours .
finally , i get programs that can make numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever written by hand .
and then i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s counterintuitive and curious programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure she was going to do the job because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because their lives depended on whether they did right .
i sat together in a 747 along with marvin minsky , he &apos;s a card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s this airplane , &quot; this airplane is from <unk> <unk> , which work together to make your flight safer . &apos; don &apos;t make you ? &quot;
we know that a doesn &apos;t even happen to optimal , if it gets too complicated .
so we start to rely on computers , for a process that &apos;s different different from classical engineering .
it allows us to make things more than much greater complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of it .
so , <unk> <unk> us the technology .
we use these programs to make the computers much faster , so we &apos;re capable of making these processes even faster .
so there &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems to be so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding from themselves .
we raise .
we are at one point that is analogous to the time , as a <unk> developed .
so we are the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really make what we &apos;re going to do here .
we are in the middle of this .
but i really think that we get something else .
i find it very much of us saying that we are the final product of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all here here , part of creation , which is always coming .
now , the lunch is for lunch , and i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m going to go forward .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was underneath the sky sky , with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian <unk> &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indians , we were going to put in a car and <unk> across the sky .
now we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes .
then when the big indian <unk> had <unk> thirst , he took an bow shot into the ground and water .
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to realize that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
so that made me sad .
i got something fear of technology .
i fear i could lose the ability to make the sunset without camera without a camera without my friends .
i found technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> .
this piece 50 years old technology became the most terrifying thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world filled with a world filled with pirates and <unk> ships and my idea .
i was like to do this as though our email and had cameras from it to dreaming .
they were inspired by being inspired by it .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use this magic to make magic rather than killing .
with 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a machine storytelling that can be readers around the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it bring pictures together and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
the storytelling storytelling needed more sense .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here says : &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;ll get a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down for me -- and the ipad knows about gps where i live -- that &apos;s really about me .
and the kid in mine is really enthusiastic about this .
i talked about magic .
i don &apos;t mean to do this magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , these ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found all the exciting .
so you have to drop the ipad out of the ipad and the fireflies .
and the light of the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a kid is that a whole galaxy can put in one single <unk> .
and so here &apos;s every book , every world , and every world is a little bit of <unk> that i &apos;m here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens a map .
and they &apos;ve had been cards , but these cards were static .
this map grows and air and air and it serves to be the orientation in the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also about other locations of the book .
i &apos;m going inside here .
it &apos;s important for me to make something that is also very much more inclusive .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard all of the <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor food workers were caught thousands of years in <unk> chambers , in an old book book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
a story that was considered on new issues like the <unk> .
on the subject , a big problem , the last 10 years is that children sitting in their dorm room , on their computers without going out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in one interaction of the book you &apos;re sent to search , you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads of natural objects .
i had collections of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and clams .
somehow , the children don &apos;t do .
this is <unk> . you need to go out to take a photograph of a flower from a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to be a piece of <unk> and tag .
so you actually creates a digital collection of photographs that you can ask online .
a kid in london shows a picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , today i saw a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network about a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of communicating magic , the world and technology .
so in the next book we &apos;re going to do an interaction with the video of the ipads and through augmented reality , an animation of imaginary that looks on a plant on a plant .
at a point , the screen filled with leaves .
you need to make the sound of the <unk> , take them away and read the rest of the book .
we all move us to a world where nature of the nature of technology are closer and some of the magic and technology .
we use the power of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of history .
thank you .
this is really an honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or prison prison .
i spend most of my time with the social view in the <unk> and places where there &apos;s lots of hopelessness .
now at ted , to see and listening , how stimulating that is , i gave me a lot of force .
in the short time here , i was clear here : ted has an identity .
you can say things here , the worldwide impact .
and sometimes if something comes on ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise didn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher , but the words of a dedicated teacher is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor &apos;s doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this as a lawyer as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , which was dominated by a <unk> , and this libertarian was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single time .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the street in virginia as slaves .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was too well .
if i met her as young boy , she came to me and i got me out .
they decided that i couldn &apos;t breathe . then they did .
one or two hours later , when i came up , she came up and said , &quot; hey , &quot; <unk> , you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; i said me again . if i said &quot; yes &quot; i was quiet .
it was something that made that you wanted to be close to her .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember i got eight or nine , i woke up one morning and went into living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was at the end of the dance table and staring at me .
i first thought that this was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
this was so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and over again , she took me over my hand and said , &quot; come on , &quot; come on . you and i , we have to talk .
i remember it was yesterday .
i will never forget it .
she took me out to me and said , &quot; hey , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you must promise you that you don &apos;t get it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
she sat me and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do .
i never forgot that .
then she said , &quot; you have to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , granny . &quot;
she said , &quot; first school , me , you &apos;re going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to promise you &apos;re always going to take care of you . &quot;
i &apos;m my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , granny , i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
then she said , &quot; next thing i &apos;m going to do is that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; but if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and said , &quot; yeah , granny . i promise . &quot;
finally she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise to , &quot; you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , granny . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and one year old .
when i was 14 or 15 , my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with grabbed my sister and i went to the forest .
we just sit around there like otherwise .
then he took a drink of a drink beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she took me , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . do it . i don &apos;t want to do a beer .
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . today we do this , you know all that we do .
i had what &apos;s had , your sister &apos;s office , &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do . it just makes you . &quot;
my brother was staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? now , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
then he looked at me and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always do anything crazy because of the conversation with granny ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking ? &quot;
he said , &quot; granny tells all grandchildren that you are special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;ll admit to you something .
i should probably not do this .
this is maybe transmitted in public .
i &apos;m 52 years old and i &apos;m sure i never drink one drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity is power .
if we create the right kinds of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course my grandmother would say all your grandchildren , you were special .
my grandfather was during the prison prison .
my uncle died in <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these are the topics that we should take care of .
i tried to say something about our research system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
1972 were 300,000 people in <unk> and prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest solar infrastructure in the world .
seven million people are thrown on the rest of the day or <unk> .
i think we &apos;ve changed our world in basic ways .
in socially weak and black parts of the population are independence despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in prison , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban municipalities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles , chicago , baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all black men either in prison , in prison , in prison , in prison , in prison , or <unk> .
but our system is not only shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also excluded .
we have a <unk> that they have treated much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty of being poor and innocent .
assets , not rocket science , it affects the outcome .
but we seem to be satisfied with this .
politics of fear and wrath has us convinced us that these problems aren &apos;t our problems .
we lost the contact .
i find this interesting .
there &apos;s some more profound developments .
my home state alabama , they constantly gave them the <unk> if they &apos;re convicted .
here today in alabama today , 34 percent of the male black population has lost their lives .
we &apos;ve been saying that 10 years of the average amount of civic labor is going to be as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i got children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , convicted children in prison .
in this country , there &apos;s been <unk> <unk> without any capacity .
we &apos;ve got a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i was <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of death death is an interesting question .
we think that because we &apos;ve taught us that the true question is : has a person deserves to die for one of him ?
this is very sensitive questions .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view isn &apos;t : anybody deserves death for a crime , but we should do it to kill it ?
i find this fascinating .
death penalty in america defined by error .
and on nine people we &apos;ve executed , one that we &apos;ve been innocent for innocent , the <unk> and from death death .
an amazing thing . one of nine innocent .
i find this fascinating .
we would never have somebody flying somebody with an airplane , if nine planes , pick up one crash .
but somehow we create it , we &apos;re going to do this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking about my students african-american history . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the world &apos;s beginning , until the onset of war war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was fear of terror that shaped their life .
these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , they talk , they &apos;re talking about them . they say people saying that they should stop saying that we should stop it in history of our nation &apos;s history .
they say , &quot; no -- say people that we grew up with it .
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of motivated motivated submission and defeating apartheid .
and yet there is a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what makes our actions in historical context .
we &apos;re constantly bumping together .
we are always creating new tension and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about laughter , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> couldn &apos;t overcome the willingness to be truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists said after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear that . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death death .
and of course , you can never give them in germany . &quot;
it was still sitting again . then one woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill us for the systematic killing of people .
it would be <unk> of us , aware and attracting people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel like living in a world where the german state made us <unk> , especially if they were a lot of jewish .
it would be unbearable .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old community , we &apos;re going to see people -- here &apos;s risk to death at death , 11 times higher when the victim knows black , and the language knows , in the same states , the body knows , in the same states , the body of the body .
and yet there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , with these difficult topics , then the positive and amazing things is affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i seems important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to pass in a complex world .
for me , it means to create time , thinking and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , who never will be at ted .
but think about a way that is integrated in our own lives .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re also aware of it as much we appreciate .
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just from our minds .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s these <unk> , i think that they &apos;re powering us , not just open for all the bright and gnarly things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the big businessmen , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do anything , but what we needed was hope , hope , a spiritual orientation , the willingness to be in more inclusive locations and witness .
this spiritual orientation is the core of what i think i think they have to participate in this .
there &apos;s no distinction for technology and design that allows us to be fully human , and even human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges very much more about us as if we don &apos;t care about it .
she will be deeply touching them .
as a young lawyer , i was a great privilege to meet pink parks .
and i came back back back back to <unk> , where they were two of their oldest friends , <unk> <unk> who had organized the <unk> -- an incredible set of <unk> -- and virginia , a black , <unk> <unk> , dr. king , <unk> <unk> , dr. king .
so these women were meeting and stopped just talking .
and then , and then she paused me and said , &quot; <unk> , woman &apos;s parks coming into the city . we want to talk .
want to be <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very happy . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are they going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i was going over and just stopped .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
i sat there and heard these women , and after a few hours , woman turned to me to me , &quot; well , i said , &quot; well , i was saying what the initiative is right right .
what do you try ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
<unk> wants to help people who were innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to eliminate <unk> <unk> without any force for children .
we want something against the death penalty .
we want to lower the numbers of prisoners .
we want to abolish <unk> .
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> .
she said , &quot; you &apos;re going to do very , very tired . &quot;
then she was rejected in front of me , put a fingers on my face and said , &quot; and therefore they must be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted ted should be <unk> .
we need to provide ways of asking us to ask ourselves : these issues , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned all of these simple things .
i learned some simple things .
we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we ever did .
i think that &apos;s true for every people on the planet .
if somebody lying , it isn &apos;t just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t heard it , it isn &apos;t just a burglar .
even who kills somebody is not only a murderer .
and because that &apos;s , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that has to respect law .
i also think that in many parts of this country , and with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i think that in many locations , the opposite of poverty is .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we don &apos;t even be measured at our technology , not about the things that we develop , not about our intellect and intellect .
finally , a society is not measured as they were able to treat their rich and powerful and informed , but how they interacted with the poor , the convicted , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i lose balance . one story .
sometimes i urge too .
i &apos;m going tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are looking forward in our thinking , in very important way .
i gave these children that were convicted too hard official .
i go into the <unk> and visit a client who likes 13 or 14 years old , and it &apos;s supposed to be an adult .
then i ask me : how could this happen ?
how can a judge transform somebody into something that doesn &apos;t it ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a kid .
i stayed too long one night and thought my kindness if a judge can transform us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should be you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think about it really really , i started to work on a bill .
i had a <unk> , poor black young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young .
and i started to announce this . the headline was : &quot; bill , my poor , young black clients like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> .
i explained to me that was a failure of the <unk> and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line that there was no longer more comfortable in this country that there &apos;s only error error .
the next morning i woke up and knew no longer whether i was just written or written on this crazy or writing him .
and my horror didn &apos;t just had written him just , but sent to court .
a few months went over and i &apos;ve just forgotten everything .
but then i decided i was my god , i must be in court and this crazy case .
i went into car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so heavy , so painful .
finally , i went from my car and went up the staircase .
when i was a grenade back to the court , there was an elderly black man , who got martha man .
when he saw me , he came over and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
he came to me and i got me .
then he whispered me into your ears .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to do it . &quot;
and i must say , there was force .
it touched something quite deep in me , identity , the ability to help each other one community , towards a community perspective .
well , i went into the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did they put these crazy ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started talking .
more people came into , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office office .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry , that we talked about skin color , poverty , about inequality .
i saw my favorite janitors from my apartment my dad came up and walk .
he always saw the window and i could hear the whole thing .
he went on and off .
finally , this older black man came with a very helpful grazing team in the <unk> and sat behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
during recess , a <unk> came into that was rejected that the janitors was in the biafran .
this <unk> ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the ? &quot;
the older black man stood on . he looked at the <unk> , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here here to say this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal .
i came to ted because i think many of you understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far far , but that it &apos;s justice .
we &apos;re not fully designed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and care .
that our survival is survival with each other .
we have to connect our visions of technology and architecture , from entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all i want to see , i want to tell you that you &apos;re just saying , don &apos;t lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give them .
you have this audience , this community , one of obvious wish , and heard to help you and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> where it &apos;s about , actually a effort to do , actually a effort of a <unk> , something about the <unk> that else is flows into the politics of punishment .
here , california for example , in california , you will be a billion dollars for the death penalty rate .
and yet 46 percent of all the <unk> didn &apos;t have with a <unk> .
56 percent of all the <unk> didn &apos;t come before court .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is what this is going to suggest that money is going to invest money in more inclusive and safety .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the mujahideen &apos;s has declined enormously down .
this fact is often given into a relationship with increased <unk> .
what would you say that that &apos;s true ?
well , indeed , the number of food doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the most recent countries in this country didn &apos;t really found in the class of the <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so they come up rates in increased high numbers .
we &apos;ve got a <unk> of the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , people forever , to the <unk> for a <unk> for the theft of good , rather than you force them to give the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who are become victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current belief is not helping anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
so , <unk> , they really have brought a string string .
they are an inspiring personality .
thank you that they were at ted . thank you .
bin laden &apos;s death is an increased state of <unk> .
two : famine in somalia : famine : o.c. spray called o.c. spray .
four : malignant aid costs . less than five : dangerous .
six : social prevalence . seven . 65 .
8 : <unk> . 9 .
different speakers : mass destruction . tornado .
recession . standstill . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so this is just some of those clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they could have been the last six days , but for last six years .
in fact , the media is willing to show us negative topics , because our understood exactly the themes of attention .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for it .
every second every second , our senses can ever get much more information on our brain .
and because nothing more important than our survival is the first stop for all the information that information is part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early early system , our <unk> .
it immediately scans all the information on the whole information of any <unk> in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to keep it looking look for negative news .
and the old adage &quot; if it &apos;s falling , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that week every week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a wonder that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always going to be worse .
but perhaps this isn &apos;t the case .
possibly that &apos;s reality .
maybe this enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century through a series of forces , so strong that it will be possible in the next three decades of making a world of abundance .
well , i don &apos;t say that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , water , water and water fields -- we &apos;ve got .
and as humans , we are much better in solving problems in a very long term , but they ultimately get to overcome .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so we can predict development .
in the last 100 years , average expectancy expectancy has doubled more than doubled that inflation has pushed up inflation .
child mortality has a 10th .
it comes that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs for a zero .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently living in a very peaceful era of life .
and charles <unk> is the <unk> for 25 percent over the last 130 years .
we live in a really remarkable time .
and many people forgot this .
and we &apos;re increasing our expectations on all .
indeed , we redefined poverty .
consider that a big proportion of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television , television phones , air cell , air cell , air cell , air cell and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of earth would never have dreamed of these <unk> .
the basis of many of them are technologies , and these are growing .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that is going to be on the search of moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> rate doubled all 12 to 24 months .
so this is about the mobile phone in your pocket about a million times less than a supercomputer from the 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law law .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it goes -- in good as bad times , war or peace , recession , depression , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers , building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
also , despite your logarithmic hand , on the left hand , it goes upwards .
so the rate of evolution is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a bunch of remarkable technologies that are available .
&quot; <unk> &quot; , something that my friends are called &quot; <unk> &quot; , sensors and networks , robots , robots , 3d printers that allow the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , digital medicine , <unk> , digital medicine , <unk> , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have the victory of <unk> 87 at risk ?
but this was great .
i &apos;ve looked at the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; isn &apos;t a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nature of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would be available for every owner .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i here at ted at ted , called singularity university called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies , with focused on how they can be used to solve the grand challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , businesses , products and services that can affect billions of people in a decade .
think about that a group of students today can affect the lives of people today .
thirty years ago , this was ludicrous .
today we can have been spending on dozens of businesses that did exactly happen .
if i think of making abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everybody on this planet ; i &apos;m about creating a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating more abundance from total goods .
yet scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resources of informed force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the history of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 1700s .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself had <unk> .
the king of <unk> had got <unk> .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome of the higgs production was made from aluminum .
although aluminum does it &apos;s <unk> percent of the dopamine doesn &apos;t get as pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then technology developed developed the technology system and made it so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet with more energy than we use a year .
16 of 16 , energy all 88 , all 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s land .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
so this year , you &apos;ve done it for first time , the cost of solar solar solar cells to 50 percent of the breast cancer -- <unk> rupees , compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar solar water last year is 50 percent .
last month this has published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade , there &apos;s six cents per capita energy , compared to 15 cents in average average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll have water as well .
talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan was the ninth of 1990 when it was on saturn , was moving back towards earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how was it meant ?
&quot; a <unk> blue dotcom . &quot;
because we live on a life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent of water .
yeah , it &apos;s more unhealthy percent saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting for 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope there .
and there are new technologies , not 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the path , <unk> .
and from a conversation today today with dean spielberg , one of the innovators do it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me permission -- his favorite version , &quot; which is called &quot; <unk> &quot; , and by many of you may have heard about it . it has the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can create a thousand liters of clean water per day from various sources -- whether saltwater saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per liter .
the president of coca-cola has just been <unk> to launch a big <unk> with 100 units in developing countries .
and if everything &apos;s done good , and i &apos;m very optimistic , then coca-cola is going to apply this technology global global in more inclusive countries on the planet .
this is disruptive innovation that there .
and we &apos;ve seen this mobile phones .
you my god , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
consider just that a cell phone in the middle of kenya is a better <unk> system in the middle of 25 years ago .
and if you look at google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton .
they live in a world , the information and communication has ever predicted how no no nobody could ever predict .
and it &apos;s better than that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries full full of books and music , technology in the medical cell -- literally <unk> and cheaper in their mobile phone .
and the best thing about it is what we expect in health .
i had the pleasure of pleasure with the <unk> of the $ 10 million dollars <unk> x prize .
we ask teams around the world , to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s using ai , you can test your <unk> or test your test .
and to win , the device has to provide better diagnosis than a team of physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the staff &apos;s team .
if this device has sequenced a <unk> or a <unk> that &apos;s not known , it &apos;s going to be a pandemic in front of their outbreak .
but now , the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are both population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and only by the way , the biggest <unk> of the world &apos;s biggest investment against an explosion , is a better upbringing and diet around the world .
in 2010 we had just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 we &apos;re going to increase oil imports from two billion .
three billion new minds that we never heard before , are going to join the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to want ?
and instead of ecological stagnation , i see one of the greatest economic history history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into global economy .
and they &apos;re going to get healthier , and they &apos;re getting better trained by the <unk> , and by doing it , they are able to have the opportunity to use 3d printers and &quot; ethical computing , &quot; and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the aid ?
how would it be with a sentence , never before it .
how would it be the oppressed , wherever they are , to be able to pay attention to change and change change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how would it be with <unk> that we couldn &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned through x prize is that little teams that are motivated by passion and focus on this remarkable things , things that can create big companies and governments only could have been able to do .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that may have already known .
it &apos;s a game that is solved .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is evolving .
je on his behavior can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played from university professors .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today today , the human pattern creates better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best <unk> in the world , was not a <unk> , no <unk> , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working during the assistant of the assistant in a <unk> at night and the best <unk> in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me so much trust in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals today to provide us the grand challenges of our planet .
we have access to technology with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to master new challenges , and to do what needed .
we expect some remarkable decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something to be a more appropriate piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical medical medical medical .
and maybe i &apos;ve been long enough in business as i can allow me to give up a piece of my own false <unk> to make this .
but before i come to my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the <unk> , and move us to the world cup .
we all love baseball , or ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; is soon and turns around and around statistics and to use this to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to show you about statistics that i hope most of you &apos;ve heard before .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about one 300 when a bat tolls 300 .
that means that the player goes missing three of 10 beats .
this is going to be beating the ball into the ball , it &apos;s going to be stuck , and whoever has tried to take the first base , it didn &apos;t get done on time and the runner was in security .
three from 10 from 10 .
you know how you called a <unk> in <unk> <unk> ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how you called a <unk> ?
this is someone that &apos;s probably paying out 10 from 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> player who had a minute sitting season on a southwest season .
let &apos;s go back into my world of medicine , which i &apos;m getting some comfortable or maybe some less comfortable or maybe i &apos;ve talked about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be a <unk> , which is a 400 400 in terms of <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , or ?
let &apos;s take life in a certain remote area and you &apos;ve got a loving people with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> that one of the <unk> that &apos;s about 200 percent of the age of smallpox .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better than this year . it &apos;s on the rising side .
and she &apos;s a <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the <unk> for a concert or a nurse or a nurse , a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one is knowing what a good surgeon or doctor or a doctor should be supposed to be .
but what we do is we &apos;re all of them , including me , locked out in the world with that cause perfect .
never make any mistake , no one makes a mistake , but thought about the detail of how to do this .
and this is the message that i took in medical school .
i was an compulsively <unk> student .
in high school , a peers said that brian was going to learn that brian was going to learn for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little school students in my little <unk> , at all of toronto , general hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
i learned the origins and tail every branch of each branch of each barrier , which is the ascending <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> .
and all over time i took more and more .
and i was good , i was going to finish up with <unk> .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew anything i knew everything else and all knew , or at least much as possible , as much as possible , as possible as possible that i was immune to the mistakes .
and it worked for for for for for for for time , until i met woman .
i was going to put on a <unk> in toronto , as a woman , was brought into the hospital &apos;s hospital .
at this point i was the <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my mission when the <unk> <unk> advice was looking for the <unk> .
and then give my feedback feedback on my lab .
i studied woman printer and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her , they made a sound .
and when i was able to hear her chest with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she suffered under heart failure .
this is a state in which heart failed , instead of pumping the blood flow , you can put a portion of blood blood in the lung and fill it down , so the <unk> came along .
and this wasn &apos;t quite hard to diagnose .
i hired her and made me for treatment .
i gave her a <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of your heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so they &apos;re going to put the liquid .
and over a period of a half to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without my favorite school .
i didn &apos;t take on on and did what i should have had been what a call would been about my favorite phone was to be told by him , so that he had had a chance to make a own picture .
and he knew her , he would have been able to get some additional information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i couldn &apos;t be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
maybe i wanted to make so successful and so able to take your responsibility that i was like this , and so i was able to make my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them home , i &apos;m going to put them back home , i was trying to say to me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , i was so much about <unk> me that i asked the nurse , which was a woman given a little printer , &quot; believe that all right when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about this and said , &quot; yeah , i &apos;m going to go to your good . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i got the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest day , night i had this dejected feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day i grabbed my things , i got down the hospital and went to go home with the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t do .
i went through the <unk> on my path .
and there was another nurse said , another nurse , not the sister &apos;s printer , but another three words me and my three words fear most of the favorite ones i know .
other medical doctors are afraid of these equally , but the <unk> is especially because we just see the patients as volatile .
three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember , &quot; remember the patients who would be done back home ? &quot;
asked the nurse &apos;s name .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular particular idea .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she came home , after i sent her home , she went and called 911 , and the family took them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure with 50 , which is a dangerous troublemaker .
they barely breathe and was blue <unk> .
the <unk> blew all strands .
they gave her her .
they launched them on the <unk> .
i was shocked and to the inner <unk> .
and i was living these rollercoaster , because she was in the intensive care facility , and i hoping that she would recover .
and after two three days , three days realized that she never would ever even awakening again .
she didn &apos;t have suffered a <unk> .
their family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they went to the <unk> .
and the day , they &apos;re going to go them -- woman printer , woman , mother and grandmother .
you say you don &apos;t forget the names of those guys .
and this was the first time i learned this himself .
the next weeks i took me out , and i learned for the first time that unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone alone , excluded , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel like to do with the colleagues .
you know all the healthy shame if you have a secret of your best friend , even though this one is on a <unk> , and then you get caught and the best friend of a conversation , if you &apos;re going to get a very comfortable with a very comfortable , and you &apos;re going to make a very comfortable talk , you know , you don &apos;t get any mistakes .
if you do anything , and never make the mistakes .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is that that makes one in the heart disease .
it &apos;s one one saying that &apos;s saying that you &apos;re not doing is bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t for my favorite school , he was very dear .
he talked about the family , and i &apos;m sure he was throwing them out and made sure i was not sued .
but i asked these questions .
why haven &apos;t i asked the <unk> ? why did i get them home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why did i go into medicine ?
but slowly , it put it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun , and i i i could feel better again .
and i was like that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never again a mistake that the voice could be able to be .
and they did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north korea , and i was going to get a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of go and i go in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> .
two days later i came to my next visit my next visit my school school , and my office school asked me to visit her office .
and she said three words : remember ?
&quot; remember you do your patients with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out that he was a <unk> .
he had an potentially mild disease called <unk> .
you can google that , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> but the the the edges of the fittest .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt free and went back to work and back back again and again and again .
i &apos;ve got two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s some few things that you &apos;ve heard about , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that was just 14 patients per night .
in both cases i didn &apos;t send them home and there were no imperfections in their treatment .
i thought he had a <unk> .
i was throwing the <unk> of the kidneys , when without a <unk> , my colleague , my colleague , at the bottom of the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s head , a <unk> in the lower right sector and called the <unk> .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i was <unk> to <unk> him and asked my colleagues to teach him .
and he did and he was a <unk> on the right sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and they were good .
both of the cases of mine , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst error was only for the first five years , what many colleagues are saying , but total nonsense .
some of my research research happened over the last five years .
alone , ashamed of and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t finish my mistakes and talk about it , if i &apos;m the quiet voice that i &apos;m saying was what really happened was i can do with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them any mistakes so they don &apos;t make these same ?
if i was going into a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you thought about me .
when did you heard about someone who talked about about <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you like you you may hear about any other doctor , but you will not hear somebody about your mistakes .
if i had a room full of colleagues and ask their immediate immediate support and start telling them what i just told you , i would not get the end of the second story before they would have to do it , you would have to forget the rest and forget the rest .
and actually , if i knew or my colleagues knew that a <unk> member of my hospital would have declined something that had lost the wrong leg , i think i would have given to mind .
this is the system where we live .
it &apos;s absolutely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who constrains the <unk> , and without any limitation that are with bad results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that attack a man .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re the ones that make mistakes from medicine , that means that a secure system stays .
but there are two problems in this .
in my about 20 years of medical health and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical error and false treatments to make anything for one of my first article i was writing for the rest of the first article , &quot; white <unk> , &quot; &quot;
and what i learned is that error is absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in a system where one of 10 <unk> is either a false or wrong , which is always causing and more powerful or more populous or being causing the growth .
in this state , 200,000 canadians die in <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , actually , the institute of medicine is actually a number of 100,000 .
both are strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a medical school program in medical medicine , all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with pain pain .
then i suppose i put the same patient with <unk> , make it <unk> and give it a slightly more easy breath breath and suddenly a little bit of a little bit of breath breath , and suddenly it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
i don &apos;t take the same .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all these are error inevitably inevitably .
so if you take the system so it &apos;s how i &apos;ve been taught to make all the <unk> <unk> , then no longer will be left .
and you know the most knowledgeable about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show &quot; white <unk> , black style , &quot; i &apos;ve suggested to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; i would say to each of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; blah blah , &quot; i &apos;m going to show my worst mistake &quot; blah blah , &quot;
and then your pupils expands , they &apos;ve pushed off front of your head , look down and swallow heavy and let &apos;s start telling your stories .
they want to tell your stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what they need is an environment that they put in the situation .
what they need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the reinventing doctor is a person knows to be aware of his humanity , it &apos;s not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s all going to learn something that can be passed by .
she shares their experiences with others .
it supports others of your mistakes .
and it shows other their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a supportive community , so everybody wins .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and if that &apos;s like this , people make mistakes too time .
so that the system that &apos;s developed developed , which is easier to find any error that makes people inevitable , and it also enabled loving creative communities where everyone who are watching health care , and actually what they &apos;re doing , and actually , for people who are able to do the potential , and actually what they &apos;re doing for the risk of potential .
my name is brian goldman sachs .
i &apos;m reinventing doctor .
i &apos;m a man . i &apos;m doing mistakes .
but i &apos;m <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn how to pass it out to pass it .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re holding from me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories about the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know that he was <unk> .
you may think that he blew up <unk> , but it isn &apos;t .
he actually collected fish .
he described one of them as much normally .
it was a <unk> .
until the &apos; 80s , he became a great style .
now he &apos;s emerging on the red list .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or other locations , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they were originally .
the <unk> , they still describe it as untouched .
what happened here ?
the second story is to have another concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i was in a lagoon in the lagos room .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work on africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a terrible job of a terrible job , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you see , the lagoon was the lagoon of <unk> and from some grains of trees .
there was a <unk> of about 20 feet , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and fishermen lived very well and making it above it .
when i returned there , was a fish that was going to go back to half of his size .
increased savings increased five inches .
they were modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had happiness , even there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story tells my favorite story about my favorite world &apos;s introduction in asia .
in the 70s -- more in the mid- &apos; 60s -- <unk> europe many <unk> .
<unk> was developed countries that started 100 fishes , the industrial fishery that was called the industrial fishery that was called <unk> fourth fourth .
i went on this and we did it out all the southern ice ocean and especially in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started there .
i know that it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our transportation system were sponge , other animals that are connected with the cause .
the most part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially essentially the reason the bottom of the ocean came up and then became a <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
within one year you &apos;re going through a survey , and then then they start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changing . from -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is going to suck out .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eating them because they were dead .
once we started living alive .
she wasn &apos;t even more .
then they wanted them to kill them because you could eat them good .
actually , this mountain of rubble of rubble to each time of fishermen are going to drive in areas where they never been treated .
but it &apos;s not going to document .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our <unk> of the new level and don &apos;t call us what was there .
if you &apos;re doing it , what happens .
on the y-axis , there are some good things : biodiversity , number of food , the green of your country , the <unk> .
it changes it . it changes because they &apos;re all about people are all of these things .
each generation looks at the pictures that they &apos;re taking their own conscious lives as standard and it &apos;s going to derive anything .
the difference is perceived as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can be a order of change .
and at the end , they just want to get the most prolific remains .
right now , this is , our goal .
we want to get things that disappeared or things that are no longer as they were .
you could think that the problem in the problem , certainly , when they were living in societies , animals and they were unaware of a few generations , what they did .
because obviously , an animal that was very often often rarely before it was .
so you don &apos;t lose a common animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and therefore it doesn &apos;t have seen as big loss .
and we &apos;re going to focus on the big animals and in the ocean , that &apos;s the big fish .
they are less because we &apos;re catching them .
there &apos;s a little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept this .
well , because you don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course many people , scientists , said that it was really different .
they &apos;ll confirm it because the evidence that you &apos;re in a early form , not as you want to argue the evidence .
so for example , there &apos;s anecdote that the report of a <unk> like this area that could be seen in this area , not being used by the <unk> or not not even <unk> because he wasn &apos;t yet science .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in conventional societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of past .
this shows the enormous role that can play a marine protected world .
because by marine marine marine gases , we basically put the past .
we ask the past that people cannot grasp because the <unk> changes changed and very low .
so , there are people who see a marine marine marine reserve and benefit from the insight that allows you to reset their <unk> .
what is with the people who couldn &apos;t do that because they don &apos;t have access -- people in the midwest for example ?
here i think that art and film may perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
there was a long time ago , there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar &quot; if you think about why people were being touched by it -- except from the <unk> , why were they touched by the ?
because there &apos;s something that has gone out in some sense .
so i &apos;ve got my recommendation , the only ones i will get , will respond to cameron so he &apos;s &quot; avatar ii &quot; underneath water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , you had to be if you had a typewriter to register this in the government .
they also had to register a sheet with <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could trace back where one text came from .
found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how much that would be less freedom .
in our own countries we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new <unk> of the world &apos;s leading <unk> and print a page , then this page bright yellow yellow <unk> on each side , in a pattern that makes the side clearly on them and your printer .
this happens today .
and no one doesn &apos;t seem to be .
and this was an example , in which our own governments , our own governments , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main parts of the existing world of living today .
so let &apos;s see what happens really on the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three main lines .
there are <unk> .
for example here , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
and the themes of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to make lots of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several cases of <unk> , <unk> that they made money from attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people are working online , but they &apos;ve been pirated by them , by having an investment system , for example , used to use money from our dna services , as we get our diet system , or we &apos;ve collected our <unk> , or we &apos;ve collected our <unk> devices .
the american agency &apos;s intelligence system two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this canal was a million dollars in this canal was frozen million dollars when it became frozen .
mr. jain itself is on your feet , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s more likely to be more likely to be a victim of a <unk> as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only even worse .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
the largest largest amount of military problems we can see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , you think , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are moving over the last 12 months and they were to a <unk> in the field of <unk> .
so these are three <unk> : criminals who are doing money for doing , as anonymous , which are resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who conduct the attacks .
there &apos;s cases of time , like the <unk> .
it shows great what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or it was this .
last fall , it had to crush down , because there was been hacked .
somebody was hacked and had invented the system seriously .
and last week in a meeting meeting with dutch <unk> , i hired one of the senior people who asked whether he was able to be able to be able to be able to be because of the most enterprising people died .
and his answer was &quot; yeah . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a row of this galaxy ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with ?
now , a certificate , you need a website with a <unk> , for example , on a time .
now we &apos;re all using all , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially prevalent in <unk> states like iran where dissidents foreign government can &apos;t use them as local <unk> , because they know that they can be able to do more trust as local <unk> .
but if you can get into a foreign foreign foreign
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happened in the trap of <unk> .
how does it behave with the arab spring and things that are happening for instance in egypt ?
now , in egypt , egyptians looted the headquarters in april 2011 , the headquarters headquarters , and they found a lot of records .
in this writings was a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes in a developed resident developed developed by the egyptian government that they sold with -- in very large framework -- all communication against egyptian citizens could capture .
they had this program for <unk> euro to the egyptian government .
this is exactly here .
so west governments healthy governments are providing governments with <unk> , so they can do against their own citizens .
but western governments help themselves .
for example in germany , just a few weeks ago , found out what called <unk> , which was a <unk> company called german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be a <unk> , you &apos;ll be able to be a little bit of your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap your connection .
they use tools like the <unk> to use your computer with a <unk> that allows you to monitor their whole communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer is , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t really matter because i &apos;m a citizen .
i don &apos;t need to worry !
i haven &apos;t got to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy isn &apos;t the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and while we today , in 2011 , our governments may be aware of that , but every right that we &apos;ll get out for always .
and we trust , we trust each future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were produced by <unk> and <unk> <unk> of a simple idea : modules from cement levels that fit together .
<unk> became very quickly the most enterprising <unk> in the world .
they gave us to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
essentially essentially the <unk> was the <unk> of our time .
almost hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it was called &quot; automatically called rock . &quot;
and within less years , lego into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t need to be engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it for all possible .
lego basically has the <unk> , the building block of the world , taken out of it a building block for our imagination .
meanwhile , in the meanwhile , at the same year at the bell labs , i announced the next revolution , the next one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one building .
the transistor was a small <unk> that was given us from a world of static , broader building blocks in a world in which it was happening .
like the <unk> , we allow us to build much bigger , more more complex loops , a rock after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that that the building of our time for experts in the world &apos;s office , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at mit media lab and i started exploring this idea , how to put the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
so , <unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they are <unk> , light , glue , motor and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets together .
they can &apos;t sit down them wrong .
the rocks are <unk> .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is cable .
so everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green and and they can build them quite quickly .
they add one blue one blue one green , and you can do light .
you can put a switch in between and so they put a little bit of plastic .
take the switch out around a <unk> , which is here , put a little bit of <unk> .
add this <unk> for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i will stop that .
beyond the simple games , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of programming , you can code , or <unk> , allows you to compute with simple , intuitive gestures to code .
so to slow down the fireflies , it &apos;s just slow down , spin it down , and it makes the pulse faster or slower .
the idea behind the <unk> is that there is a growing library .
we want to bring each other interaction in this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , notes , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve got children around children and see them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is , how they start to understand the electronics that surrounds them in everyday life and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like a <unk> system , or why the door of the <unk> <unk> , or like an ipod reacting to touching .
we &apos;ve also brought them to <unk> .
so for example , we had no experience with no experience with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
several weeks ago we &apos;ve brought out risd , and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just cardboard and wood and paper -- and told them , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my favorite version .
it &apos;s a vending machine , fear of play-dough .
for this particular thing , <unk> has got another material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so , open source is open source .
you can go on the website , all the <unk> download and make them .
we want to have the world of creators , inventor , the most important , because this world where we live , this interactive world , belongs us .
so they go and start reinventing it .
thank you .
