now why does this matter a role for human health ?
here &apos;s a diagram of the dolphins in the <unk> bay .
and i remember sitting on my desk , and i thought , &quot; now i know . what &apos;s a great scientific discovery . &quot; but it was so terrible .
they &apos;re always going to be around throughout the world and always more often , and i think that we should be able to do this .
i came back at first as much as we &apos;ve got the ecosystem of monterey bay in pollution and the <unk> and all kinds of problems .
<unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> .
about at the same time , his mother had asked him , &quot; do you know the book from michael <unk> ? &quot;
we were really afraid .
craig here moves his head .
you saw the skeleton .
we have this ability .
it has our modern kind of modern kind of thing , but i think we should recognize what price .
clay shirky , this great master of all networks , has the premise that &apos;s going on here on the <unk> , in such wonderful ways .
now today there are so many new foundations , the investment and investment , together together , together for a goal , in a bigger context .
and i &apos;m reassuring because not just philanthropy organized , and also other large parts of social health practices and business business teaching work work business as business as well .
i think that photograph close to me . it &apos;s in my office , because i always felt a mystic connection to these two men , i &apos;ve never learned all of them .
my own research is to mobile phones and <unk> , showing that 80 percent of all calls are actually going to four people . 80 percent .
whenever you have time , they &apos;re chatting with each other .
and with modern bureaucracy , a very basic approach , where there was clear separation between the private environment and public environment .
we &apos;re worried that texting , texting , facebook of the most vulnerable , but <unk> research research shows how the <unk> deeper apes can nurture more relationships to communicate love about hurdles like remoteness and backward .
one of the things we developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is , as we think , the first autonomous world system in the world .
for example , the <unk> brain tends to create a lot of <unk> .
no challenging job .
now , at the time , taxpayer paid about dollars a year to send a people into jail .
their family has been living in a city called <unk> , west virginia .

we can create these local markets and incentives to use materials as commodities for manufacturing .
and we should invest in it .
and he sometimes won , you don &apos;t believe it , on a <unk> in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- at the time .
i started my company to help communities throughout the country to improve their own potential to improve the whole quality of life of their people .
and before you haven &apos;t got children , you won &apos;t understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people are finding in the community in the community .
it takes time .
true blame makes it just from a person against one person , and somebody syndrome syndrome isn &apos;t . &quot;
too , people are not far more far .
but i found out that i was the kids i &apos;ve born , so love i &apos;m not going to introduce me to life without them .
he wouldn &apos;t get out his legs .
i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve been lucky .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there they are .
this is beginning 2000 . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here today , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia , was built by us , just when she was connected with internet .
think about it -- because there &apos;s other people like bill gates who said , &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
latin is pretty rarely . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won .
we have this case , no additional energy technology to make prices at the bottom .
for a <unk> , my apartment is about like this to the space .
and we can care about the issues of food .
and i was told by a cliff , i was told to be <unk> , although i don &apos;t know what party supports or attack .
wealth is going to be people who don &apos;t think as a market market .
there are bigger disagreements here .
none of this important theories was a full of success .
we &apos;re afraid that the world is watching .
and while a lot of this work we found something , or i found something that was really fascinated me , maybe you can remember it .
in fact , there &apos;s happening here -- from light to dark in six seconds .
i look very carefully .
this is not a expression of joy .
this lady here has even a special face , and both sides of them are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s <unk> light about it when you move , so it gets an awful thing , although it &apos;s still sitting silent -- just simply by how brilliant that &apos;s going through the reflection .
i had to move this part , but just one millimeter .
and what i showed you before , of course , was a very complex .
it wins or lose it .
and the emotional ligament between this object and shapes it is a <unk> <unk> that happens before you think about it .
i don &apos;t think we need to meet this choice .
it &apos;s also a thought we &apos;ve forgotten .
i think it &apos;s necessary for return to return .
we don &apos;t think that way .
and at the end of the table , they &apos;re all standing up and say , &quot; thank you plato , thank you , thank you for jane austen . &quot;
the other thing is that art should not explain that artists should not reveal their own school , because if they were it , it destroys the magic and we might thought it might be too easy .
art would be one of the tools that we can improve our society .
we may not agree with what religions want to teach us , but we can admire the institutional kind of visceral ones that they do .
absolutely . i meet how many of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t there something that is bigger than we all do anything else ? &quot;
because you agree to 90 percent , because you &apos;ve got a similar view of many things , and you &apos;ve got guilty else .
so he took me from places like chile -- the <unk> desert in chile -- after siberia , in underground mines , in underground mines , in the japanese alps , north america , until antarctica and even south south south africa .
it &apos;s the largest lake . it &apos;s 800 miles long .
and they &apos;re not going to believe it , but this is what they &apos;re going to say is called the <unk> big telescope .
this shack was built by robert <unk> scott and his men when they came to antarctica , on their first expedition to the south south africa .
consider , these kinds of wiring makes people in extreme cold , in <unk> temperatures .
this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll end up on this .
what people first do are actually about reading books that you can look for within the book , and that &apos;s fun .
there were lots of people there .
but how do we all do them ?
we &apos;ve achieved 10 cents per page when we work with big volume .
i &apos;m not sure what reinforce appropriate .
you charge about two or three <unk> .
fifteen dollars an hour of hour and about 100 or 150 dollars an hour , we can put material online online data online and have it on the network .
the question is : is this the world where we want to live ?
flowers are going to get <unk> .
we all know that earth has problems .
after the spores , they &apos;re <unk> .
if you go through the landscape , it &apos;s got up into your shoes and trying to respond to the rubble .
across all the <unk> .
some of these fungi are very happy .
this is an extraordinarily rare thing .
i did something else what nobody did done .
the box of life -- you get a dvd from ted conference -- they &apos;re going to put it and water and they have both <unk> and <unk> fungi , like pollution as agarikon .
i lived in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know : is life adaptable enough ?
i sort of ate myself all all all all the time .
and the doctor was given us to ensure whether it really was really good .
and everybody went to me .
<unk> , used to be part of ethiopia , is one of these places that are amazing beautiful and incredibly <unk> , and i don &apos;t understand how people create it .
this , this beautiful picture , this is the amazon .
this is actually a <unk> .
i had to think about how you push and cut away , but also how you vote the right person that comes into a <unk> .
you put the emancipation , you put blood down , you put blood down underneath the microscope , put it underneath the microscope , put the culture into the <unk> .
but we need a <unk> , pit pit pit crews .
and so medicine sometimes feels .
we looked at <unk> for 0.5 , we looked at the <unk> , and we found that they have technology and training , and then they have something like this : they have checklists .
and it &apos;s hard to spread .
so these are really enormous , lots of bees , and that &apos;s very significant .
so that means that beekeepers can replace their dead peoples very well , and so we could keep losses .
they take their beehives and their families to get their families twice a year .
honeybees are in the minority .
let &apos;s take a cave in new york with a paid 15,000 bats , now there &apos;s 1,000 . this is like san francisco within three years , the population of half a <unk> .
but not all of us have all of us , or lawns that we can turn , and then you can do , of course , a grassland in a jar of rice .
and i whistled on my wife &apos;s family sunday .
and to defend my title -- like <unk> and others do that -- i thought i did this again , again , and won it again .
this is very promising .
why ?
the blue blue blue , the largest creatures on our planet . that &apos;s wrong , totally wrong .
during night they roll their sheets , and they reduce the movement , and during the day , the sheets will open -- then there &apos;s a lot more movement .
he wrote some very interesting letters on one of his friends , <unk> <unk> , at the president of the royal society , which is the largest scientific authority in britain where he talked about a <unk> club .
so far , people were inspired only from people or animals , if he made a robot .
she doesn &apos;t know that she &apos;s filmed .
and then then it became funny and a shared experience was funny and something that she could laugh .
i was inspired by it .
this is in 2005 .
they were two of my guys who had hidden cameras in <unk> .
it &apos;s an amazing way to spend a <unk> in a stadium to watch a <unk> .
and the idea is still in the beginnings , but looks like this .
this is ted .
and this is the main thing i want to break .
now , kids who are not yet <unk> , are an extraordinary case .
they are kind of a <unk> .
the developments in natural selection are brilliant , incredibly awesome .
this is what we did on this business .
the ant isn &apos;t alone .
you &apos;ve heard this man right right .
i really appreciate this .
well , i don &apos;t believe .
well maybe we should take it metaphorical .
it &apos;s the devil &apos;s devil . &quot;
so they &apos;re actually a chord , each of you is an individual chord .
men , if you don &apos;t understand anything from this talk , you can listen to your relationships and you can change your relationships .
the third problem with headphone abuse is the deafness -- <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a wonderful method .
i &apos;m going to leave you with more <unk> , that &apos;s very good for you .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
look what &apos;s in the middle .
you look at this direction , so i &apos;ll close it here .
we thought this type of materials .
it &apos;s actually seven billion <unk> that all of their own passion , and all of them come together as part of a <unk> and creating this world -- in their own own own kitchens .
and yet you can hear black holes , even if they are invisible , and the reason it is that they play on space-time like on a drum .
whereas our sun isn &apos;t going to end up as black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow of a black black printer , but black holes can hear , even if they are invisible .
we can predict how that sound .
it &apos;s also going to be a mission for space , hopefully within the next 10 years , which is lisa .
it comes closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago we &apos;ve painted <unk> .
trees represent represent a standstill .
i think that &apos;s movement .
we are critically against the west , the view of the west , which is our identity -- the image of what &apos;s going to draw from us , about our women , about our politics , about our politics .
but instead i found a country that was completely ideological and not more <unk> .
that iran was once a collective society and we had a democracy , and that democracy was stolen by american government .
i stand here to say that iranian women found a new voice , and your voice gives me my voice .
it should be a size , a wholeness , focus on this self .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
maybe the swami has right .
they learn swimming through swimming . they learn bicycle drive by bicycle .
the fossil record in this area are only found in south america -- a beautiful clear field here -- and in this part of africa .
you just see these videos , if you get bored , they just move .
but i was excited , and i went on .
the khan academy is also there .
this is shifting and reflect by functions .
red means that they &apos;re <unk> .
a lot of the efforts to do the classroom to make a lot of the students to teachers .
and the collaboration that they had started with los altos , how did it happen ?
is it ready for the big toss ?
i got a call from a <unk> i &apos;m working on .
but it &apos;s still a silence like a <unk> . &quot;
she asked , &quot; who &apos;s this charles bonnet ? &quot;
for example , when his freshman director came back to him , he said , &quot; and who are these well-meaning young men ? &quot;
and then if you were standing , the young suddenly went vertically vertically , 30 feet tall , and disappeared .
these attributes of a dialogue there isn &apos;t in these kinds of interest .
there &apos;s a area in the <unk> part of this inferior cortex , in the teeth and eyes , and this part of the inferior is active when people have the most primitive hallucinations .
&quot; kermit doesn &apos;t mean anything . &quot;
sometimes i find them interesting . and i &apos;ve got lots of pictures of it in my favorite .
edith widder : i made these footage with a special camera , which is the sensitivity of the dark <unk> eye .
so this crab for example , these crab cells , <unk> chemicals into the water , just like a squid or a squid .
this looks like a plant , actually , but an animal .
there &apos;s something little that responded to react .
it should attack the hunters of the <unk> .
a approach would be a painting .
if we get the double ones in their two strands , you see that these things look like teeth .
it &apos;s packaged and <unk> .
one is a sausages .
again , these are all <unk> , scientific <unk> .
hold your eyes open and your head in motion .
the ability to intuit concepts intuitively with pictures of objects and processes .
if the oxygen system is still very thin in , you can be able to be with care and hard work for the world &apos;s office .
i &apos;m here to commit to help us , and change the way people and other creatures are doing things .
not by the <unk> , but enabled collaborative action that emerges from literacy .
the other big narrative of social <unk> is the tragedy of the fittest .
toyota , instead of his <unk> users , they treated as a network , and they &apos;re educating them to produce better , although they also train them to produce better for their competitors .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , everything about frostbite and trouble and <unk> -- cold , challenging conditions .
first we &apos;ve developed a little experiment where we gave people lego blocks and they asked to build something .
and if you said yes , we &apos;ve given them a new , and while they did this <unk> , we &apos;ve built the other thing they just built again .
there was a very nice relationship between love to lego and the number of sentences .
and i think that ceo basically didn &apos;t understand how important sense is .
but i should point out to this , by the way , that in the shredder shredder condition , they would cheat .
people didn &apos;t want them .
and we had two types of people .
think about children .
and i think that in the industrial revolution adam smith was true as karl marx , but we really have <unk> . and now we are in knowledge knowledge .
this is normal conflicts today , because children are just going to send them up very easily .
and my mother &apos;s my mother was so bad that she was given to make our history of our history , all boys and girls had given new names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the population are illiterate .
they didn &apos;t want that . it &apos;s just happened . they lost control .
and 70 percent won their lives back .
i think that &apos;s all given me .
this is the european average average .
on top right , there &apos;s a total energy consumption per person , in about like canada , over 300 light bulbs per person , but the density is 300 times bigger , 1,000 people per kilometer .
if you really want to get out of solar cells , you should have to take the traditional <unk> of <unk> , where you don &apos;t just get the roof , but it &apos;s covered with solar cells .
and one third possibility is nuclear nuclear power .
i tried it . it works . some of these are what &apos;s called the lifestyle .
i &apos;ve been like boy , since early , i was interested in a musician and god thank god , i &apos;ve got it .
he &apos;s a boy from a community in caracas that did his <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
so that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing to do to do new dreams , new goals and progress in the various opportunities that has music to offer music .
this is a <unk> technology that helps you to do right back right profiles at the right time .
how we call simple , <unk> technologies , and this is the first of five sentences that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this year was happening this year . she went into the <unk> .
is the first word &quot; doctor &quot;
many of these generation will not press the button , even if they have a <unk> , because they don &apos;t want to drop other or a few dollars . even if they paid for for 30 dollars a month .
the color is the different spaces in the house .
i &apos;m going to show you some of the latest and profound inventions of cybercriminals .
if you want your charity go offline , they will .
how do you get a <unk> to do a company ?
so let &apos;s imagine our predators , which we call fun bad hacker , something that we &apos;ve built in .
there &apos;s another interesting piece of things that the cybercriminals have uploaded .
well , you probably ask about what happened with these people .
and in fact , in <unk> of them , i could identify hotels where they were recently , it was a <unk> somewhere on the globe .
thank you .
the <unk> can recognize the juveniles , the juveniles can recognize the <unk> .
and you are in something that probably the veins are probably going through the bones .
we all know that these bones are placed and when you dip it into acid , they should not be left .
the <unk> are the big , <unk> who are extinct extinct .
so , it &apos;s also cool .
a friend , a colleague , dr. hans <unk> at the university university university , also with <unk> .
people always say , &quot; why does you do this ?
and then i started writing my book to show the global scale of this problem , showing a graphic collection of individual nations in every country in every country .
so imagine this nine biscuits that i found in trash , represent the global <unk> , okay ? at beginning we have nine .
this farmer about 16,000 pounds in growing 16,000 pounds in growing <unk> , which he didn &apos;t translate a sheet , because a little three-pound potatoes that aren &apos;t perfect , they are not perfect , they will be fed into pigs .
it &apos;s a living organism , i cut a piece , put it into vase and it was just another two weeks .
and if they use these things , they don &apos;t need to do anything .
i &apos;m going to go through some .
on the left .
we need to change that stuff .
here &apos;s einstein , of course , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s big <unk> sentence , and i &apos;m not sure whether this james <unk> or richard harris is .
and you can see that the icosahedron disappears in the dodecahedron , and then they just fuse together .
what a <unk> cat .
front of the horse before the horse before the horse .
&quot; 10 milligrams , 20 milligrams . &quot;
so , i said , if i get a circle , you see what happens for patterns , and boom , boom , the red system .
you need to be exactly right ! it &apos;s about measurements , extensions .
there were only two more <unk> on the internet .
i &apos;ll talk to talk later .
i mean , all on &quot; <unk> , &quot; that would be like a call of your <unk> , but for the whole world .
it may definitely be done by people here from the audience .
if we had a chance for example , seven years ago , we would have been talking about the current innovation of the military , about the massive <unk> of the <unk> , and we would have predicted an era of stability in the world or europe .
now , in this environment where you don &apos;t know whether the potential enemy would be willing to be fighting or attack whether the weapons would be expected to be used to be the environment , that environment is what &apos;s really appropriate to be a conflict .
it &apos;s a huge blue area .
so if you ever imagined ever imagined in time to see how a dinosaurs looked looked like , this looks like a dinosaur .
it cannot always be able to shoot their threads ; they have to drop the pants .
he never seems to be a certain girl .
but what i did was a <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to worry that readers are falling in the <unk> because if you imagine a single musician shark , you know , you know , you know , back on the front door .
you will find some kind of urgency aware of urgency , as much as possible as possible .
my favorite research was wonderful vague : <unk> of the wilderness and <unk> .
that means that i love my love and to do something that i call &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot;
audience : 25th .
audience : <unk> .
audience : seven seven .
well , then i &apos;m trying to try the impossible -- or at least improbable .
audience : november . june what ?
of course i could say an answer , and you wouldn &apos;t know . i &apos;m prepared .
ok , oh , ok -- you have a <unk> ?
let me explain what that is .
i would love to talk about astronomy , but i think the number of people who are in the <unk> atmospheres and <unk> in the upper atmosphere of jupiter , the number of people who are in a <unk> .
no , if you want to know how society will be in 20 years , ask a <unk> .
just two weeks ago i have -- you know , i &apos;ve got little , middle , big <unk> for the show .
my mentor . he came up and spent hour for hour .
i suppose you &apos;re going to .
right ? this is simple physics .
if you put it in the book , it &apos;s actually <unk> .
and i think , ah , the square of the length is proportionate .
you would think , you would have all this extra place , we would have lots of space for all our stuff .
it &apos;s time i &apos;m going to get it .
would i have a little more freedom ?
north of churchill , <unk> , there &apos;s no ice on the hudson bay .
it was paid many years from <unk> <unk> , before i really started realizing that i really had completely understood .
frank wilson has written a book called &quot; the hand . &quot;
so what does this do this play for the brain ?

but if we were in these tenement schools , we found out that no one there had television on television , they didn &apos;t know his face .
so , to say that these viruses in the past are probably extinct in these societies societies are probably extinct .
you &apos;re told what you &apos;re doing with is 140 signs or less and people who are interested in this one .
we constructed a <unk> system which means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter .
&quot; ... give people more information and follow them with their intuitions @ # ted . &quot;
since all i read was books in which they were forced to be fluent , i was convinced that books , nature had had to be controlled , and they had had to act of things that i couldn &apos;t identify with .

my dad is sick in alzheimer &apos;s disease .
and reading it &apos;s as good as impossible .
even if it &apos;s hard .
so we need to orient ourselves in the physical and economic limitations .
so in the sense , we also suggested our promise .
if you have trouble , understand what this is for the average consumers in the united states in the economy .
if you want to get a fish , you get a woman and if you need one woman , get a fish . &quot;

the arguments of id is the same old arguments always have been refuted , since darwin &apos;s time to today .
the natural selection is so amazing elegantly because you think that problem is to explain complexity , in shape of nothing else than simplicity .
now the next one : &quot; the president of the royal society gave a strong inner conviction , &quot; -- &quot; ... that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
it feels in a <unk> minority , but how do american atheist actually put themselves together ?
i &apos;ve no appropriate response to other fields like history or philosophy , but i would be amazed if you were different .
darwin was thought that atheism has already right and good for the most important thing that they think , but i think , &quot; not exactly be &quot; not right .
if people like -- if atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein was using the word &quot; god &quot; and then they use it as practical metaphor for this deep , mystical part of the physics that we don &apos;t understand .

until recently we didn &apos;t have to know how a vaccine did exactly .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re constantly changing .
these drugs are no cure , but they provide a huge triumph of science because you have an automatic death death death sentence by a group of a group of mine who have access to them .
but you know , the research that happened to hiv has helped us with progress for other diseases .
this was a slow process , <unk> process that was dependent on <unk> , millions of living chicken eggs .
and despite the radical <unk> production and the vast <unk> of e. coli , for example , i &apos;ve talked about , you &apos;re going to take a look at the palm of the time -- that would be life expectancy .

something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge of algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they get over this balance because they go around everything that you know at first .
it should be to new ideas and new ideas and strangers .
and the man replied , &quot; pretty nice , what ? &quot;
i know you &apos;re waiting for another bad pr list -- i &apos;m just fun -- but now just a short iteration , and then i show you new material about possible solutions .
until the next year , it will be an update on version 2.0 2.0 where you can put them directly to buy your purchase .
even all of these republicans here : it shouldn &apos;t be about <unk> .
what really impressed me on the gulf at the gulf is that they are <unk> .
and there &apos;s no longer trying to do any more except some people who are trying to use the beach .
we heard that bacteria feed oil ?
this <unk> swim swimming across the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor went back , they took back back .
what the smartest of the ties , i don &apos;t want to make a <unk> remarks about people who make birds .
okay , people who think as conservative if they really wanted to be really conservative and really really , they should send these <unk> to the <unk> .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
okay , okay , i &apos;m more than my genes -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to get it because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
it includes a molecule that we know as neurotransmitter .
and this is just a <unk> . it &apos;s much smaller than a human .
now , cells , as as well as trees , can grow new branches and lose old .
and we can even talk about the <unk> .
if you look at this numbers , you can easily get some obvious points that there &apos;s a big potential for <unk> in the brain .
perhaps this technology will be able to learn that we &apos;re taking ourselves through apart and each other .
he &apos;s mostly working on music music and advertisement with his company , the <unk> .
so we &apos;ve prepared a quick experiment to show you this .
ks : no , not .
while he did , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so how does this work : there &apos;s a matrix of <unk> .
ridiculous , or ?
and a friend sent me a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a super-massive scandal for a few weeks .
but he still made this .
so his farm is incredible .
he found this wild plant , the <unk> .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try to try it before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what hell does this mean ?
at least supposed to say . i think it &apos;s .
farmers who rely on nature to find solutions to find answers , instead of nature solutions .
and the old fire to new fire is called two big stories about oil and electricity that both of the two of the ocean &apos;s ocean are going on the air .
our fuel for mobility is going to three of cars .
you can make it quietly : it &apos;s harder than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
also better light and <unk> and forth , lower land infections for a third .
and so in about 20 years of cheap , private air cells can &apos;t have any resources without financial losses on their roofs and lower their transportation .
and whatever we replace it , it will be in about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- although we buy more of them what we have or new nuclear power , or something called <unk> , or renewable , or less centralized .
so on results , and not motivations , to focus on , can be <unk> and conflict to the <unk> of america .
i was just noticed that i had had two family records of his whole family .
this simple thing that shows that donor in areas where least kids go to school , not funded schools . this is asking new questions . reaching aid that they need ?
two years ago , 8 in 2010 , i called my father .
i don &apos;t try to design the toothbrush .
we remember and can this look look at this in every book my son &apos;s book , that life was developed four billion years ago -- four billion point two ?
so similar , i &apos;m not sure .
there are threats , there are trap . one trap : the vertical .
you &apos;ve got time thinking , you have time to do about art and things like this .
you go back into the future , back , back , back , so .
they are all from families where most often one person is at home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come up for their training and their structure here .
we get them to move on right and left so that they can obey wins and know the consequences when they cause orders .
let &apos;s all go online . &quot;
it &apos;s predicting .
they said , &quot; this is enough for the .
then you can support us . this is the job of you . &quot;
but i need to have my hotdog .
they can listen and join .
for example , take the <unk> <unk> .
if you think about wikipedia , everybody thinks about the content , and at the end , you &apos;ve created the largest encyclopedia in the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was built .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience is showing us that what happens there , an incredibly complex process .
we can keep our own language apart , but not the stranger .
we reviewed this by american babies who never heard a language at the beginning of critical period .
it looks like a <unk> from mars .
science on one page has a very rational approach to their environment , whereas art on the other side , actually has an emotional approach to its environment .
now i &apos;ve got a $ quick slide over here to show you .
let me show you over here .
the dalai lama said , &quot; love and compassion are <unk> .
the rags were burned from a little girl whose body was burned down .
it &apos;s part of every human .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we vote with compassion ?
the wound is full of maggots .
suppose you may like squares , and honestly , who don &apos;t like it ?
we start with a <unk> , and then we ask another one more than one .
then there was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
i said , &quot; he &apos;s been living dead .
&quot; i have what &apos;s going ! &quot; &quot; i haven &apos;t got memo . what happens ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what does you do ? &quot;
so i went into the lobby and saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said : &quot; magic is the only thing that &apos;s done .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate you how deeply terrorism is connected with our daily lives .
at the time i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not meant of ideology and politics , but by economic constraints .
i think many people were actually holding me for a little bit .
but most of all , they &apos;ve got in serious health research with organized crime .
this money was in <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- in bar , understands .
no one wants to control his circumstance , controlling his circumstance and monitoring its skills .
some of you may think about you now , &quot; wait . it doesn &apos;t necessarily look like a <unk> .
clearly , i wanted to leave my <unk> , but what i didn &apos;t have seen was that it &apos;s definition extremely uncomfortable to leave his <unk> .
and i really learned that , i really learned that the greater the challenge , the greater the emotion of special achievement if you get to end .
well , i thought the atlantic is big , but the pacific is really big .
but this didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
it &apos;s this little green slice on the horizon , which makes it very nervous for rising sea level .
we can start getting better , more motivated to make better decisions .
<unk> <unk> : why i &apos;m going to go across the pacific pacific pacific
this is the world trade on the cover page .
why ? why ? why ? why do you want to do this ?
he doesn &apos;t see spare costs . it &apos;s not use additional time .
they were able to make this .
and then it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about you feel good at places where they didn &apos;t feel good at before .
and that &apos;s hard if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself : how can it be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not as hard to do somebody , and one day before school i said , &quot; yeah , you can go my homework <unk> , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers that i had written on the night before .
we were both brought up on the back benches in class , so we wouldn &apos;t be bombarded with <unk> .
maybe you &apos;ve brought your <unk> and <unk> teeth , but never told about it , because how can you say yourself if all around you would want buried you underneath ?
this is french science .
well , then go .
if you look at these trucks here ; it &apos;s the largest truck of its kind of earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and fastest-growing co2 from co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also why canada are now the number three is in terms of <unk> per capita .
and as a father i couldn &apos;t imagine what &apos;s going to do with a soul .
by doing this , we remove a large part of our biggest <unk> and we &apos;re replacing them with most greenhouse gases of the current oil .
the <unk> of their work is the <unk> that you can buy in every store and put the millions of indian women on your forehead . it &apos;s a ritual that &apos;s tightly tied to with the institution of marriage .
<unk> shaw was born in <unk> , raised in <unk> and trained in london .
i hope you can convince you that complex and complicated isn &apos;t always the same .
the most <unk> <unk> is the one that we want to affect -- public support for the government .
so i suggested in my first tedtalk that we should spend 21 billion hours a week with computer games .
just 30 minutes of a day , a day , a major improvement in your mood and increased increase in joy .
why a game ?
how could an awful game such a huge effect in so serious , sometimes more comfortable situations ?
there are four ways of starches , or resilience that is affecting growth , and there are scientifically automated things that you can do every day to build these resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma for this .
it &apos;s been increasing by more practice .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake your hand for six seconds , then your blood ball will increase a lot of your blood , the <unk> .
and in this project , we &apos;ve actually got hundreds of people around the world and do this together with us . actually thousands people are involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
and then there came some people from chicago and said , &quot; end of 2007 , the motto of chicago festival was called global warming . we &apos;ve got a 280 meter of gallery and we want you to fill them with your reef . &quot;
wool and <unk> aren &apos;t just two ideas that fit good .
so <unk> asked : &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . it extracts . right .
so we &apos;ve got , from wool , matt &apos;s feminine , evidence that the most famous thing that mathematics is wrong .
and their individual ideas , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular thing that &apos;s female-pattern -- consciousness self-confidence -- i think after the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we will hopefully understand what &apos;s happening .
this person is otherwise in <unk> understood and intelligent , but when he sees his mother , his delusion , and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area has damage damage , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
tables and chairs and <unk> -- nothing happened , just like normal people , and if i &apos;m going to show you a picture of his mother , the grim activity stays low .
he knows that his arm isn &apos;t there . nevertheless it &apos;s an compelling , <unk> experience .
maybe you can do the <unk> that spasm the phantom in the phantom .
my pain are gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have phantom , and therefore no longer no longer any more than any <unk> , no spasm , no spasm , no grapes in the <unk> . all my pain .
<unk> is blue , b is green , another sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is buba ?
your favorite is to <unk> , which most of us don &apos;t deal with .
that &apos;s kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video are <unk> .
good .
he has learned that he would have to be able to put both hands on their specific <unk> , much bigger and more expensive chip .
a framework means a shack in the forest .
does he see where the sound comes ?
because we believe that it isn &apos;t biology , but culture .
and some stars die in spectacular explosions , which are left behind the remains .
on the right there is gravity . einstein has explained that .
and beyond that , it creates new ways of transformation .
it was too early , but he was a moral set , an inspiring for scientists who were concerned about the control of the guns .
suppose aliens were looking at our most advanced creatures , we &apos;ve had seen the most advanced basis from far outside in the cosmos , but it &apos;s been entire 4.5 billion years of earth history .
martin rees : this last century ?
and it gets worse , &quot; then i would make a photograph of it and make a dozen <unk> .
now , these are students , so they gave them a lot of money for things like the <unk> and make-up .
and then we asked them how happy they are .
but tremendously different motivations .
this is <unk> in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend each other , they were to be teams , they were actually the league .
if we hear about the <unk> , from high school , often often we often believe that this is still one of these most inclusive conflict in the middle east , whose roots are as old as the region itself .
ironically , that was at a time when the <unk> of iran was alive with washington , not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that focuses on that is focused on affecting diplomacy . is diplomacy survival , is inevitable .
you can look at certain ways , or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port-au-prince was not as good as she could have had not as good as the map of california .
so the trick .
and then he said , &quot; he was not environmentalists . &quot;
this system wants to status quo status quo , also the status quo .
so it &apos;s not about my subject is most important . that &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizen , need to get the republic back back .
for example , some people are going to have a meeting thanks to go through a fellowship of school .
anyway , this is on my pencil . &quot;
everybody &apos;s just a little bit wrong .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law law is not true , it &apos;s true .
here in the model they see the attack of the <unk> .
if you see fireflies fireflies are in north asia , they are as many things in america , they &apos;re constantly constantly in . they ignore each other .
each of your favorite is based on this critical region , the <unk> that has about 10,000 independent cells , which every single one of the <unk> , has a electronic rhythm -- a high tension , a small bit of tension , a small bit of sunlight .
they were a while in trouble , but then they were apart .
so i want to show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge and describe what happened .
now , normally if you don &apos;t usually believe it for a metronome , but we all run -- we &apos;re going to go back and walk back .
so , this weighs just a few tons , so it &apos;s going right quickly .
but the most primitive scientists in his field .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in <unk> order , and i told you they should look for your names , your favorite , or your mother &apos;s favorite .
and then maybe this libertarian &apos;s maybe maybe this <unk> or maybe a <unk> that are not worth economically , a resilience against disease or pests or another feature that &apos;s useful for climate change , and the others don &apos;t have .
we are going to see children in television .
and the idea with svalbard was that it &apos;s cold there , so you have natural temperatures under the <unk> .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
pay attention to your body posture ! this one isn &apos;t right .
maybe any lady , one lady ? thank you very much .
you just tried two concepts -- two in america , and one of the russians .
madness ! i need to talk about innovation cycles -- things develop , there &apos;s lots of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced by something else and die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it goes because i don &apos;t want to know that the competition knows my schedule .
i mean something really interesting that will happen here .
okay , we &apos;re going to talk about the commercial development of the world &apos;s commercial space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has a enlightenment .
institutions are going to be naked , &quot; and if you &apos;re naked , well , it has the consequences .
fourth meaning of openness and fourth principle is <unk> .
the toothpaste is from the <unk> .
you know that bees and fish live in schools .
all around us is a medical revolution , we &apos;ve got a revolution that will help us to defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , cancer .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a <unk> mass , <unk> in a brain .
and you can see that the ring disappears by the blood supply .
but the real question is : how good work work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a <unk> , it automatically inhibits angiogenesis in very effective .
but even more interesting about this study , that men who have developed <unk> , which is that that actually have been more tomato tomato sauce , basically less blood vessels who feed your cancer .
albert from <unk> said that &quot; discoveries are showing that what all has seen , and think , what nobody has thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a <unk> in discover magazine .
it has to make fun , unlike everyday problems , frankly , not very good puzzles .
this is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that physically , but on a computer , it goes over to computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
which direction is that kind of falling down here ?
so there &apos;s games like &quot; brain republicans &quot; for the nintendo dave , a <unk> .
looks like a black character . where is this ?
i really think that a girl is so powerful that we all had to train to be not that way .
i remember my father , who was very , very violent , suggested .
we &apos;re used to to be used to make girls of the <unk> , their own life that we actually made them to objects and they were transformed in .
and she looked into her eyes and said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual where they were girls who are <unk> , with their families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your side for the rest of your life . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t get things easy .
why should they want to be <unk> , <unk> ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers said , all six teenagers were made out of the photo row that they had made by the photo row .
but the incident came in in the middle of january , in the northern hemisphere , 7 o &apos;clock evening .
this is 10 feet away .
and what shows this example -- what is important for us to keep in mind ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a <unk> and traveling a year through africa where i asked people why they built fractal , which is a great job when you can get it .
and this is going into some towns to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would spend only long <unk> because it &apos;s going very quickly , and they &apos;re very cheap .
right now and weird makes weird makes weird .
we have a <unk> . ghana .
but the bad news is .
instead of going to friends or relatives , they looked at david &apos;s workplace .
today today , more effective development is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to the highway .
fear of hacking . check .
we &apos;re asking some rules on and hold on them .
this conversation will run better . &quot;
just when i went to come here tonight , i started to come here , started to get a daughters .
and we developed 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i was the first time &quot; anna <unk> &quot; and the famous first sentence : &quot; all happy families are equal .
i want to show you how something is going to look like this beautiful .
if i put this into water here , you see a <unk> <unk> , and this is the <unk> that &apos;s the water that keeps the water from the <unk> of the <unk> . it stays dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : <unk> ...
i &apos;ll show you .
but tesla &apos;s success was not about duration .
one thing i want to understand is that not all chocolate doesn &apos;t have to wear the naked chocolate .
we can pull them up or turn them up , or turn them up on or turn .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it in the circuits of the circuits in terms of anxiety .
we are to grasp what these circuits are and what are the circuits in the clinical evidence and symptoms of those diseases .
evolution is actually more like a <unk> as an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we &apos;ve discovered is whether you look at the leg of a man like richard , or this cockroach or a crab or a crab , or a crab , relative size of this feather , the relative amount of this feather is equal for all that we &apos;ve seen .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s incredible , students have tried it and they couldn &apos;t say it .
it makes this with a <unk> glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a model , and imagine with another colleagues at berkeley .
showed that from the most enterprising <unk> director , two thirds of these children are children who have children who have children in women .
on monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and flew at this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at us and say , &quot; how did it go ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard business school about a woman named heidi <unk> .
and i got my hand back again and i fell on all other women , and then you &apos;ve got more questions , just from men . &quot;
one woman contacted me about this about this , and i looked at them -- she looked young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t regularly do it as they should , but they do .
so not fear was the most profound factor .
but it &apos;s true in the middle of the bullseye .
i want to talk about this talk about how we spread in this country , how we get information .
so they &apos;re in <unk> , clearly , clearly , and that works .
we say that everything is fine ; they &apos;re good .
so this patient is about 50 , we can say quite exactly what big risk is to get prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need the educational level of listeners in this room .
and this bee was certainly accepted , &quot; i &apos;m going to put this <unk> , this bloom , i get the nectar and then get out . &quot;
and when you talk about nature that is as writer my favorite subject , how is the idea of the ?
well , we &apos;re all the same .
the only technology here is the cheap solar system : pretty new , plugged into a <unk> , even i could have a <unk> of 10 ar in 15 minutes .
if a <unk> <unk> , the grass is on this altitude , and it happens immediately .
and now i say i want to build a layer of games on the world &apos;s world , but this isn &apos;t true because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if not , it &apos;s shame . there &apos;s nothing that you can do .
come at a certain time , they get their sodas for half .
and then they can do really good .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a community dynamic that tries to find the best news , the exciting stories .
we &apos;ve talked about this last time ago .
you see , if i turn this around here -- hopefully i &apos;m not going to get the world too much .
you can see , here it started .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> who should have been teaching students , which was just the law of copying , just like a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it &apos;s fun to work .
and so this is why this is what we &apos;re doing , and we &apos;ve got people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they work on this , that &apos;s really your goal .
thank you .
what brunel was saying to his passengers was the experience was through the landscape .
what makes life easier , pleasant ?
so part of them , you &apos;re doing this by making a great new facility , using one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of time , <unk> <unk> , and they were actually part part of the current problem .
and how brunel can we can do by we have a bigger effect .
i &apos;m obsessed with the waiter who was told by his bosses .
mark <unk> and i &apos;ve tried to answer a series of studies right right now .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm demands .
but for the <unk> , the discipline of all these <unk> , is a <unk> .
americans themselves discover that unlimited choices are attractive in the theory than in practice .
so parents would say more things like , &quot; judge was just for such short time , but he has taught us so much .
robert frost said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s going lost by translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant branding of pink . &quot;
three problems have one together : they are more stereotypical problems that are controlled by natural forces .
so thank you very much .
it &apos;s supposed to replace competition with collaboration .
and then we build a <unk> that we can test the maximum achievement of machines , and we can get very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the <unk> didn &apos;t get the best as a <unk> , but as a <unk> movement .
the atomic atomic enters enters the stage .
and then then the 92 nuclear power that would provide the energy , the rest of los angeles <unk> .
then take you and put it on the screen of your television , and you get out of it , right .
if you replace the word or today &apos;s internet today , it &apos;s very right that his attitude now is very <unk> . let &apos;s hear it in .
i think it was this exchange that has led to computer games .
ph : i hope you understand how <unk> that is .
and then this is the running forever won the future business company .
mm : because there has been a role of a role , something to do .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars per minute .
and where television has made what &apos;s built , is a very exciting new kind of communication , and we have the <unk> of two industries and a new way that thinking about it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can animate simple blocks , simple materials : when i go through new york , i think .
it has given me suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk about us and build some installations .
the use that the city has laid into the public space for the day is significant , almost an international model .
even the parts of the aircraft had french names .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and this was finally , like i was looking for some <unk> and <unk> , where design ended up going to show you a moment .
he said , you have one of the new , better chairs .
or they &apos;re throwing them up into the position .
i then knew experience , but when i put in the offices , where there was <unk> , never anyone would come on the idea , <unk> to turn on a <unk> and adapt your headrest .
and dengue fever has spread in <unk> .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember that , i &apos;ve read in a <unk> , that <unk> had the first <unk> <unk> , about 52 registered cases , about 400 <unk> .
we need something that was really <unk> that it was not the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : male meets females , lots of offspring .
so , they &apos;re not our biggest problem .
&quot; why ? &quot; why ? &quot;
and most of the time i don &apos;t take me any of them even though i &apos;m a <unk> .
look at the data available .
now , our mobile phones can now build a story of our dna .
bill <unk> : your health depends on where they live .
this is my grandfather .
so from the simple reason that nobody is talking about it .
like the beginning , plants are moving through water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a remarkable article from a nature of &quot; nature &quot; that &apos;s the debate about the phosphorus crisis .
80 percent of them are going lost .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent we take one of 25 percent .
we have a working technology and one that is using some of the <unk> integration that we &apos;re doing on the world &apos;s ecosystem system .
and he was a called <unk> : he was thinking of all the <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual steps repeat , but they repeat without being a <unk> .
as an architect i &apos;m just about relationships between the parts and all , but it &apos;s always going to be more important for businesses .
we &apos;re also going to take us on the level of the building of the building where we could build five separate towers , but they should all put on the 60 floor to one single <unk> mass .
we come back again , a few years later , 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape looks honest as well as we &apos;re rainforests .
the difference is mostly in the desert desert , or maybe <unk> in <unk> whatever they want .
there &apos;s lots of toxic waste , lots of things that were illegally thrown out and there are there .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , simply through fertilizers that cause enormous problems with water water ; rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for <unk> .
but we can do that and there are opportunities .
irrigation is the largest solar vessel on the highway .
need to work together .
so -- what is it in system d.
we want to see our products in the store .
so that system system doesn &apos;t pay your taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological amplifier to enhance these kinds of water -- muscles .
this is what this looks like .
here we &apos;re doing , or cut the nerve , from small parts of the <unk> and let &apos;s let us have our <unk> , our <unk> -- signal , two others that gave us our hand -- signal gave us . signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put any electrode inside and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and this is our goal -- to have something clinically to carry .
this is jesse and he squeezes a <unk> .
thank you very much .
sub-saharan sub-saharan africa mostly , there &apos;s 22 million people living hiv , which are estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected around the world .
governments have need to create effective health models for ethical issues that are authorized in the different developing countries , in the developing world , in the world &apos;s government and the <unk> of the study .
so the basic problems we have faced is is a high consumption and too many people .
so they &apos;re all fully fully fully fully fully fully fully able to do the criteria that people usually do .
so you see this electricity that goes north -- the <unk> in this case -- that &apos;s just enough to the galapagos , and this <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that starts coming up with the galapagos .
we also know that not only are threatened by the not only <unk> , but they &apos;re also identical .
i want to show you that penguins are drawn into <unk> .
turbo has got to pat his <unk> to his <unk> , and we put it inside and it comes into here .
and then there &apos;s another thing that comes very comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t solved : our basic political geography .
both of them are quite a long threshold .
again , like mongolia china , china doesn &apos;t conquered russia . it &apos;s <unk> .
for <unk> countries , china reduces its <unk> , so that <unk> and cambodia can sell them cheaper , and they were to sell from <unk> to china .
what i want to introduce you here , i call a day , day .
these two arrows form an bow , an arch of <unk> and other infrastructure that combines the west bank with gaza .
most of you .
so what comes next ? how does the future of the european union ?
53 countries and far most of the suspects are on the map .
this dream is time time .
does it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone igf-1 is affecting growth .
so how can a hormone actually less less less than that ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 are hormones that are active in particular conditions -- in good times -- if food is safe , and not much stress in environment .
we don &apos;t know the detail about how it works , but we know foxo genes have an impact on the lifespan of people .
and basically , you could modify genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process i &apos;ve talked about , which is going on in the worm very quickly , another normal normal strategy , like a bird , like a bird , so that bird can live much longer .
you will never see an ad , because nike wants to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes that were <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to run a <unk> .
this view is that many of the <unk> <unk> , like prozac basically change the chemistry of the brain as if indeed the brain was actually the brain of chemical soup .
and my favorite colleague seymour <unk> <unk> that .
we found out that a mutant , we found that a mutant needed much longer to get back to the <unk> , and when we were able to find the genes that were able to find a role in this mutation .
so this question has been asked for people for long , but we can actually test it .
so , like that , mosquitoes are going to find us in the dark by looking at us . they smell .
just by you , this is the cheese .
people even said that they &apos;re going to be stung by mosquitos .
in <unk> .
and every time i felt the <unk> looks at the eyes of me .
and as a result , fat is one of the best sources for adult stem cells .
while we talk , about clinical trials , about <unk> clinical trials for the use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not only in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens if anything else happens ?
but here you see what really is going on .
i can &apos;t tell you anything about it because i stopped the headline .
<unk> <unk> : what you don &apos;t know about marriage marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better better . it seems that we can make these receivers , with help of material that is encoded in dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s spreading his wings , it &apos;s <unk> , but it cannot really take off because the fly is between two <unk> .
for an intelligent creatures like our fly , they don &apos;t have a stone , but change during the animal learns .
so many kinds of experiments were able to do the identity of the critic &apos;s identity of 12 cells .
there &apos;s some ideas in the <unk> and artificial intelligence , how you could do this , but we still don &apos;t have solved one example of how intelligent behavior of physical interactions on living matter .
here &apos;s libby , or actually a <unk> of libby .
ed : okay . tb : okay . a little bit more in the room please .
i know from their own experience , i know that hospitals for young people can be a very dangerous place .
here &apos;s an image from my favorite photograph of legacy .
i &apos;m saying one of you , this kind of <unk> that includes everything from your goals , will be the most fundamental transformation that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime in health .
they don &apos;t stick like velcro , just by <unk> or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you climb up the bottom of the barn , and we would put it up a <unk> or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , they did , and he does this .
of course completely different than you would see this in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at rising sea sea .
and i would say that people are working in the ocean and think about the goals , we &apos;re supposed to be much lower .
this is the ship i was in antarctica last three months .
if this ice melt down sea sea sea sea sea temperatures .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news is for the corals of the galapagos islands .
your ratio is water .
but then at the end , you see the <unk> in black .
we &apos;ve got very interesting opportunities that co2 in the atmosphere of years , we &apos;ve always done this with <unk> , but we &apos;re going 20 million years back .
and this is the job that einstein asked : figure out how gravity works .
einstein had already been space and time , biases and curves around gravity .
but deep deep deep into hidden in the structure of space , so the idea , could be more dimensions than we see there .
and just like the strings of a photograph , you can vibrate in different patterns .
not .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that may be able to explain some of the most <unk> features of the world , or can we actually demonstrate these extra extra dimensions ?
so we &apos;ve got two plates with colorful dots on it .
now , can &apos;t see the predator , what is that you attack ?
and what makes sensory information true is true for all information .
and we &apos;re looking at about 30 seconds on what a pretty hammer is in one 18 minutes .
why ? because if you actually see the dark in this shadow , and reflect the same amount of light on your eye like the dots outside the shadow , they would have to reflect more -- just universal of physics .
where do you know ?
and it comes into the hive , finds a empty <unk> and hands up -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , or ?
you agree ? yeah ?
often there &apos;s no right or wrong .
in in new york , in new york don &apos;t .
we are also a species of storytellers .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the risks that work .
but in a modern and complex world they need models to understand the many risks we faced .
think about cancer , avian flu flu , swine flu , sars .
there was no new findings , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it <unk> by taking data that we &apos;re taking data that we &apos;re talking to our <unk> data that &apos;s going to disagree with our own .
i trust another group , determine whether my airplane was safe to fly around with it .
these people are .
and he was found around here near this , at stanford .
they had good circumstances with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took any one of the shoes to get them or save them , where i could raise me as volunteers , but i found that no one did something .
we opened the first phase of 2009 .
robert <unk> : building a park in heaven
and groups were called &quot; terrorists . &quot;
they need a very energetic process that can solve the core of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about that we probably see in the history of arab world , in the history of arab world , a revolution .
paradox is that this was so promising decade , and it &apos;s from a main reason .
and they were not just calling their slogans on the streets -- they took them into negotiations , in negotiations , because they were the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new business program .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , this strange empires in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the sun comes out of the sun , the sun coming out , they come right up to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i admit i &apos;m a little bit nervous because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we think differently about cancer , that many people have a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
there &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics by just comparing the genetic resemblance .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; okay . at least this guy is doing good connected . &quot;
so we basically measure every oxygen as a own .
if you have malaria , we give them up , or some of the <unk> of it .
where we really need to get ended up is the process that &apos;s happening right now , and it &apos;s on the level of the <unk> activities of the why your body does not heal itself how he normally does it ? &apos; &apos; &quot;
danny hillis : cancer understanding proteomics .
they are all tribes in tribes .
it doesn &apos;t enough to give these people up .
because at stage three are most of us .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before somebody tried something like this .
in fact , martin luther kings was called three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair and don &apos;t . &quot;
and suddenly they were brought out the <unk> and tried to find out : &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically we automatically put the little bits of plastic up .
these colors or <unk> <unk> that were designed to make it just so much to make taxes for the ground on which they stand , weren &apos;t as enduring building .
they &apos;re <unk> the stability and security that can provide the lap of an uncle , comparing them with the <unk> of a <unk> niece .
but my perspective has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most primitive form of <unk> satisfaction .
i can &apos;t really explain them , and it doesn &apos;t .
stories like these , sign like this , are practical aid in a world that yearns to bring compassion , the <unk> of suffering that could otherwise be able to be able to do .
gandhi was also a really depressing person .
and the first day , our <unk> gave us us and taught us our motto that we now had to make for the rest of the summer , to instill on the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of your known .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group without imitating the minds of the other .
so this is the world that we live today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s own own way .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine this , you make a interior , i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very competitive circumstances , and my parents didn &apos;t have higher school education .
and so we think that through all the changes that happens that we &apos;re today is an incredible opportunity .
it &apos;s an initiative that &apos;s based on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
we &apos;ve got 30 different technologists sent out in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people in trying to learn what this particular segment needs and demands .
and my dad came to me and said again , &quot; you know , i remember that every generation has better better than the previous one .
i know many people who are very smart and say , &quot; why can i not solve my problem ? &quot;
i started them together with another family .
don &apos;t you believe that we have accountability to take the accountable seriously ? &quot;
i still drive four years old ford as before .
but this is not good life .
this is what he &apos;s praying .
whether you believe it or not , don &apos;t make any difference for me .
so he said , &quot; what &apos;s you think in your hand ? &quot;
what is this in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball represents your identity , what they &apos;re .
when my children were even small , i went into her room , sat on her bed and looked at my children at sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i &apos;ve got to do three to 10 million -- but yet there &apos;s a very significant number .
so in a village we &apos;ve got 100 laptops , each one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese characters for <unk> .
they answer the question : how does it feel to realize that you &apos;re going to ?
we really learn this really bad lesson really good lesson .
think about a moment , how it &apos;s , feel right .
and unlike all other animals , we are obsessed with trying to find it .
and i need to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly delightful book about a subject that everybody hate , for an audience that never would be going .
the effect of this is not just <unk> wheat , but mountains of grain .
1986 , she came to america .
and the answer was <unk> : &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our transportation costs dropped on a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in five years of the dotcom , our <unk> has passed away our transportation system .
and bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy in the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re often looking at happiness as if it was lucky enough that we have to capture , one thing , or maybe many things that we have to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- this is simplicity .
what we need to learn as leaders is that we can affect the production of production by creating the right conditions so we can live their bidding .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
and there &apos;s a deck of your mind , you move your eyes , but your eyes move on with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m quiet . &quot;
amy , come you please ?
the method : what did you do ? the outcome : what did you see ?
i just read one .
real science education should be able to give people a voice and empower them to express them , and so amy &apos;s supposed to be the last word in this short history .
poor people don &apos;t have this possibility of choice .
we were in the 70s .
and around there , we have to realize that the principle of a quantum system is not only undermining the species we talked about , but we &apos;ve talked to our society .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody else already said , &quot; yeah , nice things up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was professor at the <unk> davis called davis and received lots of attention . this allowed me to do this to the launch of the program .
we have eight engines in this vehicle .
thank you .
they drop apart , they degrade and they end here .
i mean , people ask yourself whether mobile phones are secure .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> mobile phone phone .
and for those who can &apos;t read , says , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural interaction , which isn &apos;t going to be a step towards the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the most vulnerable toxins in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , filled with <unk> , the &quot; <unk> death . &quot;
and months later i learned who was really .
i search for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold him alive if you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper , we &apos;ve got hope over again .
but one feature .
suddenly he knows that he has been defeated .
so to make them that , we need to put them back back .
we &apos;re <unk> the area , we &apos;re <unk> it , we sent people in , we put the buildings from inside , the <unk> , we helped the first <unk> , searching and rescue and rescue .
if i do this , i don &apos;t lose the original detail , on the opposite , i could write history .
you will withheld from public opinions .
this isn &apos;t very good .
and which is a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : which country average average better or china or india ?
because the indian man has been a advantage for two years from indian woman .
so , in terms of political change , they introduced .
china , i think still some of these examples , <unk> essentials -- especially on social capital , public health , a sense of equality that has not exist in india .
it was a place where people with <unk> and with various <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and now they have the problem that they &apos;ve spent all the money to do with these advanced electronics in these countries and now all of the time .
a slightly chaotic environment where probably many ideas emerged where people were more new , interesting , <unk> battles -- people different heritage .
about a decade ago or two decades ago , a wonderful <unk> named howard <unk> and read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re sitting on their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was .
is it also going to vice versa ?
in the 1970s , this was one percent 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be summarized in the category of crony capitalism , political changes that help a group of good connected , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
while you can just see , as globalization and technological revolution , it &apos;s much harder to judge money , it &apos;s much harder to judge all the whole .
so they &apos;re unprecedented amounts of time and tools to educate their children .
we created modern <unk> .
this is his little hand .
we &apos;re all going to die on one of them .
this was a huge disappointment for us because we had believed in a new development .
i even believe that in places like oregon , where you could take preventive health tests and swallow an toxic dose of swallow , only half a percent people ever done .
so long long talk short story , they came to canada .
but i heard about cancer as most of the most enterprising disease , how do the good and bad things together ?
some articles went to say that far as much as it was resistant to cancer , and beyond it , not only against cancer , but against that , metastases are spreading into skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that that &apos;s where these tumors tumors were in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- what <unk> that skeletal muscle is capable of controlling angiogenesis , able to control angiogenesis , able to control angiogenesis , that can be able to control angiogenesis that that blood vessels can be able to control angiogenesis .
this is a very far more inclusive idea , but i really think that that is possible .
after then my translator came my translator .
she was the girl who was in the breaks another for her team .
and i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a 11 years old .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator ?
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children in all of korea , and he found families for them .
they &apos;ve got a lot of time about the dictionary .
so i open this window , look out , and see , like flames from the page of hotels shooting up at the altitude , they &apos;re burning .
so we ran out into bath , took towels , and they were out of our faces and children .
until the adoption came through . one year ! what does it need ?
this is your favorite .
this is sydney that will be three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are small planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s still much more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomena ubiquitous , or is it something depends on the planet ?
and this deeper <unk> , underlying the point is that science is that , the life that we know about it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , all the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
see : during uganda , south america and zimbabwe , russia is to one percent .
they find the highest hiv rates in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , down here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya here .
it might be that there &apos;s something else , that &apos;s what the transmission is more often .
we know that about 6.8 billion people ever lived .
this wasn &apos;t only an economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter period of time in germany .
likewise , it &apos;s connected .
they have to be able to eat me . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end up three questions about three questions , short in australia , if the united states loses their place as number one economy .
no , we &apos;re going to get able to get , despite the big <unk> that we &apos;ve combined , despite the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work work and different parts of our historical history .
niall , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider spider spider spider .
spider spider spider spider is almost entirely of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider , are quite diverse .
and also , there &apos;s a high potential for their ability to be able to be .
what i want to pay attention is not the <unk> , so nice you may be , but it &apos;s on pictures .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photographs . there are more photographers .
this sounds strange in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of the <unk> has contributed to have contributed to .
the first thing happens when you &apos;re a problem , that the first goal of the institution immediately is changing from whatever goal is changing .
the inventor doesn &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states , trying to find out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
it was created by having their <unk> , using many of these tools , and certainly the intelligence intelligence in the world today today are the same work for the attacks in the last week .
you have <unk> , which probably is for us to be from the bread , or the fibers , because there &apos;s just full fibers , because there &apos;s a fibers .
everything is on its place . first level .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the <unk> of the kinds of connections to a deeper plane -- my search is about the answer to the question &quot; what is so special ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you are molded , they go back to to prove that they are alive and character .
if you make this bread , they can use any kind of grain from every kind of beer .
it will be a kind of <unk> , while we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very long , very long , writing these scores , and at time i work on a piece that &apos;s 180 sides long , and this is a big part of my life and i &apos;m going to make my hair .
it &apos;s demonstrated by brian <unk> , who &apos;s an remarkable artist .
so this gives you a little bit of a little bit of the piece .
what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes : a dish with <unk> broccoli , and a dish with <unk> .
i mean , last , after all , if we look at babies from the face , they appear pretty futile .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies every other species .
the <unk> is bringing them to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : so .
our consciousness about this thing is extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be dark .
&quot; babies and small children are like the r and the 20th species &quot; says , &quot; <unk> alison <unk> . their research , how babies can do practical information during gaming gaming can make decisions .
if i could just borrow for a little demonstration for a little demonstration to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
then you repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly again , and again , until something else comes out -- in this case , it &apos;s supposed to be the character , like i walk straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you don &apos;t do something that we don &apos;t do .
here &apos;s some simple scenes that he got come .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it .
some studio actually use our software to do exactly that , and we &apos;re soon going to get some of our <unk> to see some of our <unk> in a few major <unk> .
we thought he would just hold balance .
here you learn to go on the <unk> -- like most of you hope .
but i need to say , i never forgot what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are crucial crucial to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re ever lonely , you write a new york times , then they get hundreds of emails , and i get some of them today , about frustration .
some stories are just classic , but it &apos;s common .
it &apos;s <unk> . nobody has ever bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new empty document in word -- that might happen !
but i think there &apos;s actually two main points .
the other products were supported by microsoft with open standard , instead of apple &apos;s standard .
and if somebody writes me a <unk> , what happens daily -- i say , &quot; screw me . &quot;
but when i looked at the most sophisticated technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and others in these parts of digital technologies , i made a very big concern about the <unk> .
and to limit the risk of these new things , we ultimately need to limit the ability of individuals that are basically giving them access to the power of power .
i think the challenge that we stand -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is that we are going to do this data with the background that we use from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , like <unk> , they &apos;ve got all kinds of incredible qualities .
and to give you an impression of the last few efforts -- it &apos;s going to be on 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s fairly remarkable for us .
and if you do the concept of insurance , we can do a much more effective entity -- the entity &apos;s entity -- use feedback , to deliver feedback .
12 years ago , caves began to be fascinated by me , and i shifted my research in this direction .
so wonderful and grim things .
there are ice underneath the surface .
so they &apos;re a very sophisticated life form .
it &apos;s even as much energy for biology in this cave , that there are actually a huge number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have many properties that used to be used by people and other organisms earlier .
whenever you get a goal , they need to take a certain steps , some way of journey , some way of getting away .
and so it &apos;s archimedes , the great greek mathematicians .
fakes were painted on this and it suffered under extreme .
this means before we could start to digitize the <unk> , we had to take this book apart .
and this is what this looks like .
but by flying around the speed of light , they give x-rays .
this was a bad idea , because <unk> from macedonia had a son named alexander who &apos;s big , and she lost the battle of <unk> .
because right now , they just put their data with <unk> and so forth .
the initial owner of the bottle was one of most fanatical <unk> in the 1700s .
i asked myself : 160 dollars for something ?
it has four balconies .
a schematic scheme is that many of these things from japan are going to notice .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was an object that i couldn &apos;t get into your fingers , and this was the <unk> cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste one of the <unk> -- so it isn &apos;t necessarily significant that i wasn &apos;t quite impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one there , with this reaction .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sold it for <unk> dollars .
this really interesting about virtuality is that you can measure it .
well , i could develop a game with the names of the names by just a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if you &apos;re real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok , then . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and virtuality is gorgeous in it .
and i want to tell you a short story , 1999 -- there was a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how individually engagement can be transformed by the psychological and neurological insight that we get when we observe people playing people .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> called las <unk> .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with diet .
there &apos;s hunger in america , 49 million people and almost million children .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the 30 anniversary of <unk> grain and big <unk> , using chicken <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in america and the change of how we &apos;ve addressed agriculture international .
this is a <unk> that i got two years ago , which was one of the biggest projects i and my company were ever involved .
but i &apos;m going to narrow myself on the beginning of the process , three very <unk> statements .
if we are so good , what we do , we should not be able to create an architectural manifestation that would just squish through the <unk> and <unk> bottlenecks ?
the architectural implementing in the <unk> said , simple .
and this is the actual amount of trouble .
the second technology we did , we use things that you know from the <unk> of an opera .
here &apos;s the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about today about how you collect stories in something .
one of these projects is about a half and half .
these are the pictures that automatically creates .
so long as i was wake up , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments history history .
it &apos;s <unk> . well , on .
a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmers .
what if she found the truth only one year , what would you do the next 35 years of their lives ?
&quot; money deserve and open a business was indian <unk> .
during anesthesia , he had told them that he wanted to be , and he had given me a few more talented chance of opportunity .
don &apos;t get me wrong , writing has benefits .
with your hand , almost impossible , except in a <unk> , and then communication is limited .
very funny people , if lol is that .
you don &apos;t do this .

rory , you &apos;ve been introduced together .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you basic what it looks like .
there are also <unk> , and they are going to be <unk> , but if they &apos;re going to put these <unk> , they are used for another kind of <unk> .
the <unk> . this is a difficult problem for reasons i &apos;m not going to be .
there &apos;s another thing here , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is useful information on a general quite bad thing .
so , i think it has the minimal foods that we might probably get to make things .
and we decided that we should not be so much thinking about the costs , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book called &quot; what &apos;s the guy &apos;s child ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t interact much with people who don &apos;t like you are .
so we can think about things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half when i say you will be in hospital if you get a missing limb , without previously previously called mri and <unk> <unk> .

harder is to move the dead to an answer .
my friend simon singh , a <unk> , <unk> , wrote the big bang , &quot; etc . &quot;
and now you open your eyes .

my experiences with the islamic world is completely different .
there &apos;s example , there &apos;s the character .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why mean babies mean a erotic catastrophe ?
because it &apos;s the secret of the desire .
especially important about this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting -- especially interesting is that there &apos;s no <unk> in desire .
this is your <unk> and <unk> , which is biology , natural instinct .
then then they &apos;re desire . this study takes curiosity , <unk> .
you know that there &apos;s a chemical space that belongs alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
okay .
it &apos;s played more smaller spaces .
so early <unk> have some digits .
so i asked me : okay , this is a model for design , these adaptation that we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; that &apos;s on me !
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to bring here to language ?
albert einstein -- i &apos;m talking about somebody when i gave a talk at princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what is it about life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a talk or a lecture .
and there were about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rarely has a more powerful mind with such great humility of the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he said .

lg : happy .
licklider understood , computers can do the necessary <unk> to make insight and decisions .
each interaction is always recorded by always more sensors : your phone , your card , your computer , you &apos;re lots of data , and we get the opportunity to understand our experience .
these records were human .
by a process of process , what otherwise one problem for 40 people was about three months , became a simple job for three people in 40 hours . all are the final problem .
we should stop seeing outside .
for dinner with my wife and children go home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i haven &apos;t got time to get your time .

help me to make green to new black , help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this was an opportunity to use scratch to my mother &apos;s card for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical , which is this <unk> .
in this case you take a <unk> , you put it on a pile and the stack of <unk> determines the behavior of different characters in a game or a story , in this case , that &apos;s the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can code code .
if kids like victor like this projects , they learn important concepts like variables , but this is just the beginning .
what i want to talk today today to give you a background , is that cars are art .
i want to talk about this .
and i think this thought that great cars are a soul , very useful . you all know that . you see a car with soul at the first sight . you know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite books that really describes our relationship with cars .
right ? and they decided it would be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven apartments in <unk> <unk> house in malibu .
there was lots of dialogue .
i think we felt very close each other on this day , we were called &quot; threads and we were looking at the concept for the actual creatures of true <unk> and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring him to boston .
since i have just a little lab .

100 billion is the only number you have to know .
what you need to think is that we have to do it with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with the hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explain was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to it , we have at least a good theory that can explain that if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore it will be even more forever , although the universe will continue forever and ordinary matter and radiation , always a certain amount of radiation , some clinical fluctuations , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give big fluctuations .
it cools down .
it &apos;s a very basic fact of the universe that you accept and not necessarily .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future that i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to do something out there , like me , to the africans and poor who fight with their dream , who are dreaming about their dream .
whatever i was doing in my real world was only repeating my little devices in digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my <unk> , and i put it a little bit of <unk> on this table , the table of <unk> .
and the camera is not just my motions , but it &apos;s also able to understand what things i think in my hand .
and why ? we can just play with papers .
all of the work you &apos;ve seen about my learning is in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is going to be the third park in rio june june year .
again , you don &apos;t need to dig deep underneath the earth to build this one .
i give you a short example .
almost every year we have these awful <unk> .
we are on average in terms of the average in the city .
a city of the future is a city that don &apos;t give anyone from this great community , which are cities .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct an darwinian darwinian model of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make it nice , so that it &apos;s kind of gravitational sets , so it makes you joy to just look at them .
and some of these are too big in every case to use them for battles .
our strong response to pictures , to the expression of emotion in art , beauty of music is going to be with us and our offspring , as long as the human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a fairly complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i &apos;m simplify it .
so you can see here as the computer sees the environment , and since you can &apos;t see the vibration , we actually did even have the driver with red leds so that he really can see what &apos;s happening .
let &apos;s see if mark can avoid you .
or for blind people , in daily devices , in education and in the office .
a subtle research system had begun . the <unk> that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and i heard them , meant that something couldn &apos;t be true with me .
my psychological route was a catalyst for <unk> , hate and <unk> and <unk> , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , cancer cancer would be better on it because cancer is easier to cure as schizophrenia . &quot;
to <unk> , to <unk> , if social change starts , he can &apos;t be able to be more <unk> .
and this is what we go through right right now .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is what i &apos;m here is where we should look for life , rather than mars , even though mars is a much more inclusive and interesting place .
and the ordinary astronomers were full of contempt .
because it &apos;s <unk> that the kind of life that can live out there , there has enormous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another object , this up up with creatures and <unk> and naked -- quite <unk> things for a little kid .
the first projects were humility , but they took technology and then they might transform them into things that people use in a new way and might find a new functionality .
the other thing that is <unk> is to be <unk> , is that we decided we decided that all the gadgets , all the <unk> , and trying to make it as beautiful as possible .
so we called it water water . so this is another example where everything combined in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the ideas , it &apos;s all closely intertwined .
this is my favorite anthony , switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to take him back back . this was hard .
yves behar : what stories tell stories .

my aunt , an incredible scientist and brilliant woman , became early widow .
she was the <unk> <unk> for women &apos;s rights i ever heard .
look at these young girls who come back to school after exploding into their faces . &quot;
the world that has been given given was given was a world in war .
then they &apos;ll be tense .
they need to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation , in a world where everything is <unk> and where we &apos;ve happened some of our best conversations on a screen .
ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
and if it &apos;s what it &apos;s interesting is why this is even interesting , you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia because there &apos;s a country that &apos;s divided by the impulses .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need changes .
let me give you one example : in turkey where i come from , which is a very most optimistic republic , we had something that i call <unk> , which should protect universities , who should protect universities .
if i was the only person who thinks , then we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , muslims as muslims have seen , they were independent , <unk> .
so the eu process was given to turkey , the efforts of turkey , to join the union , in turkey , during some more inclusive nations .
there &apos;s a very big nose that won &apos;t seem to be something that would be connected with anything .
if scientists today , a century later , you want to make neurons visible , then they make them light out of inside , instead of making them light .
carl <unk> : glimpses of how much our brains
but this trend is less clear .
but for many parts of africa has said to me , &quot; the <unk> was going on at night at night , at the right time , at the right time , the genocide was going to start on the front page . &quot;
and instead of having this opportunity to have local and international leaders soon come back from the second <unk> , the events of the second <unk> , the events of the war -- september 2001 and wars in iraq and iraq .
design design requires a strong focus on the <unk> , <unk> thinking and <unk> and <unk> .

some of the mammals went back into water .
every man should have a chance to clump into a little bit .
but there was nothing for this purpose , so we &apos;ve got married with prostate cancer , and then we &apos;ve created our motto , which is : &quot; the face of the man &apos;s face . &quot;
mo <unk> from canada , from america , and england , and british <unk> , and said , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year we had lucky to have 450,000 <unk> . &quot;
this kind of conversation , people involved in each age , is so critical and important , and i think it &apos;s much more important than the money we collect .
he could see what his forest happened , his environment , because his grandfather took him at his favorite time he was just two years old and started calling him about the forest and the path of life .
when i thought about it , i wonder what our grandchildren and our your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your your

&quot; my world is subjective . &quot;
or maybe he was just a yogi sitting on a rock and the sky and the sun and the moon .
and if you &apos;ve lived an extraordinary life , you will get into the <unk> , or how french call it &quot; <unk> &quot; -- -- the heaven &apos;s heaven .
and so it comes to this great rituals , where large <unk> of the <unk> is built for 10 days .

<unk> <unk> opens up the eyes for a new view of myths india and the west -- and shows why these <unk> systems of the <unk> , the <unk> of the death system , and the <unk> of the aid of the <unk> .
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 and the world saying : &quot; i &apos;m completely competent , &quot; means to be able to capture himself with the weakest grade .
you &apos;re interested in what ?
your friends and family are going together to come together , and there &apos;s a tombstone on their grave , standing on this word , &quot; here lies a great engineer who invented velcro . &quot;
they &apos;re happy . this is the conversation that mothers and fathers want to hear because your kid &apos;s good in math , and you know what &apos;s next .
this is because you know what they are .
i don &apos;t have patents and i never have money from a medical school , and i don &apos;t get to choose that they choose me .
so how do you know whether your breast density is from dense ?
ultrasound has more biopsies that we &apos;ve got to do with other technologies , and it &apos;s not very common .
if you find a tumor , as long as it &apos;s less than one centimeter tall , it &apos;s about 90 percent , but they &apos;re enormous with increasing increasing .
this image of mbi showing this tumor much more explicit , just like a second tumor that &apos;s focused on the surgical possibility of patient .
it costs an radiologists for a radiologists to be an expert in a regular state of detail of a normal <unk> .
some women who die breast breast cancer , many years later , and fortunately , most of them survive .
da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da it &apos;s a lot of power .
we unite these physicists together in los angeles to see what they &apos;re building .
mill .
they &apos;ve got slept in this room .
this is a memorable vision .
it &apos;s a question of the consequences .
so let &apos;s go on the point .
what did i do ? did i heard my stomach ?
this is interesting . this is a different way .
the key system is basically a visualization visualization of a human character where any body portion is proportionate to the surface that it takes in the brain .
this is white noise .
and db is probably going to roll .
i just make this money .
thank you .
and he said me after a long silence : &quot; i ask me , whether people here don &apos;t find any fascinating fascinating than my videos . &quot;
this is the reason i mentioned david edward , a scientist at harvard , created an object that can absorb toxic elements with these plants .
no , not potatoes , but tomatoes , herbs and so on .
so , the tragedies of other people can take easier than your own and i want to just be just going to be the most profound spirit of this conference .
according to malcolm gladwell was &#91; the &#93; &#93; &#91; the &#93; &#93; cocaine &apos;s version of the <unk> version of the city .
he was really interesting sight .
he went back into the second cane and said , &quot; hey boys .
like mcdonald &apos;s .
think about other ways , you know , you can expect a very high risk .
the second reason was that the gang was brilliant in marketing and cheating .
economists talk about the theory of theory -- that every game for two people has a <unk> .
so , <unk> is skydiving with a board on your feet .
so , <unk> on as high as here is only possible if you step step towards step , if you really work harder and mentally working .
ue : no . this is just smoke .
occasionally i meet with scientists .
so i had hope hoping that by making some natural elements , a little bit of fog , i could make this space tangible .
horror means that there is a difference whether you do something or not .
the big mountains in the distance are less .
how do we create an idea that is both tolerant towards individuality , and also beyond the two different directions ?
i talked about new ways of <unk> , one which is attracted to animals instead of <unk> them .

<unk> as a dolphin is not .
as an adult , when i got over the amazing findings of penny and koko , sue savage-rumbaugh with kanzi and panbanisha , <unk> <unk> and alex , the <unk> , heard , i got excited about this .
<unk> <unk> : ng : like this .
we are at the national aquarium , we &apos;ve got to be at this research , for research and preservation .
but we found quite quickly that we had created a system that connects people together .
today . this is the first time you talk about this topic .
this is an image of me and my daughter on we hold an israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , make a posters with me . &quot;
they came and there were so many . one day , i remember saying that <unk> spoke with a journalist and asked him &quot; who will see this ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everyone . &quot;
it &apos;s not the <unk> . that &apos;s not my side .
and sometimes war is <unk> . but sometimes , with a few effort , we can avoid it .
and what we &apos;re talking about &quot; yep is more &quot; trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to make an architectural effect almost negative . by who or what we are .
and we looked at this guy .
and slowly you start thinking that sustainable lives is less fun than living normal .
so you go on the expo first first to the danish program , take a bicycle wheel , and drive on to another <unk> .
it was interesting because she was about 9 to 11 in the morning , about the <unk> of the <unk> , how many billion they should invest in saving economy .
this is a <unk> from switzerland . switzerland , there &apos;s a national need for <unk> .
we often make little films often .
what i want to talk about is the biggest problems in the world .
but it &apos;s a problem , of course , if you &apos;re asking people to focus on problems .
so what i &apos;m going to do is really say that we &apos;ve had a very long time , we &apos;ve had a number of choices in which we &apos;ve had a number of choices .
and then you ask why economists ?
but it says that what we can do about it is very low , very high costs .
the <unk> malaria malaria has a few million infected infected every year .
what happens here is that we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good movie in terms of that i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure it &apos;s true , right , but if you don &apos;t expect to be able to do from <unk> in his next film brad pitt like he goes down in tanzania , or something like this .
they all had the same material , but they could have been able to leave the framework of the debate , and they &apos;ve done it to be able to be able to get their own lists .
his power , wealth and greater freedom is <unk> . &quot;
secondly , china has managed to reduce the income income income income , without changing the political framework .
freedom house found that , although 50 percent of all countries are today , 70 percent of them are oppressive , in terms of that people don &apos;t have any cure or <unk> .
because ultimately , the question that we and seven billion other people on this planet is : how can we create wealth ?
the <unk> isn &apos;t quite much in your place .
we are going to do what really interests us .
it was published six months ago , and it &apos;s got incredible attention .
you need to ensure that for growth , it &apos;s secure .
i think it looks easily out of human skin , which was fascinated me .
but i think it could be a fairly functional and sustainable supplement to our most advanced resources .
chinese workers are not squeezed into factories because of our <unk> demand for ipods .
except because one person spends your time to make a piece of something that doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to be a piece of something .
min &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; some understanding that simple . you don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
this is the <unk> , the min i gave me on my family home .
the taliban are now a public .
if any kid caught caught down these rules , it gets punished hard .
if i look at suicide bombers , the younger ones are when i , or my age , i &apos;m so inspired by her .
and this is going to arrive at enceladus , just there on enceladus , from <unk> , hopefully hopefully in the middle future , specifically equipped to pursue this question .
is the internet actually a place where you can visit ?
and the landscape changes . three years ago , when i started to do this , there was only one cable along the african west west , shown here in this map of steve song as thin black line .
and that seems not right .
this data will send layer on layer on the device , starting with the basis of the product , and put this material layer on layer by layer by layer on layer by the <unk> process of <unk> <unk> .
it was produced by the layers of layers of about four <unk> .
a repulsion is probably less likely .
they can just make it right in place .
here &apos;s what the product is produced .
without any doubt , i think this technology is creating a revolution in production and the most fundamental as we &apos;re going to change it .
he was worried that if he called her in this name , especially outside , in public , you could think he would be thought of this notion of jihad .
they use his <unk> .
the good news is that it doesn &apos;t need to be like this .
but many of these factors that were playing a role , are even more stronger . half of work is done .
i was my girlfriend &apos;s <unk> , who was the <unk> , in the mathare valley slums .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty wasn &apos;t the bad . it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of all the thing . &quot;
do you think i will miss the violence or drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
first , instead of a few months of time and they &apos;re going to be forgotten , time was much more <unk> .
but it &apos;s less likely that they remain .
and during my first year , i went on my business .
it &apos;s even said that more energy is required to make a solar cell , when they &apos;re going to get into your whole world .
solar cells collect four four four hours .
and then they are under large pressure and they &apos;re dangerous .
this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s only a little cylinder here , the generator and all the <unk> in itself , and this is the hot cylinder , hot cylinder is the bottom , the hot cylinder is cold , this section is cold , and it comes out electricity .
you don &apos;t need to use the hot water , it can cool cool .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a solar system to use this energy as quickly as we do it at the moment .
we bubbles it up and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying lab with which we did the measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i still had written bad poems , and he never ran the <unk> into the air , but he &apos;s gone to cuba .
so , from <unk> , there are amazing things -- -- from which i then end up an image that &apos;s ultimately going to end in my work .
i work for new yorkers and i &apos;m doing it , and then 9 / 11 was , &quot; well , a <unk> end of the world as we knew it .
then let &apos;s summarize clear clearly ! be <unk> with your tongue , but so that we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his transportation system had to be extinct . &quot;
this man is angry because somebody everywhere put on his staircase , and basically -- you know , <unk> seem to be a subject -- -- you know , <unk> here .

td : since my youngest childhood , and after all , i &apos;ve been given many different duties , and when i was young , i always came out to me that my journey was already been <unk> .
this is beautiful , but we should remember that an similar process should be played on inner level .
td : lakshmi has worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let alone all other what she did doing so that happened and i was quite much bit very nervous for this week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that learned in the simulation , and others who have learned in reality .
if i say &quot; we &quot; i &apos;m my advice for the <unk> .
but no one believes that it will be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the most part of the spending in the administration of the bush administration is actually more than anthrax and the threat through biological .
we know that the virus will inevitably mutate . it will be another virus .
but in the scientific community there &apos;s a more inclusive debate about what &apos;s about the most likely about people in <unk> and coughing , how much about the hands happened .
some of the poorer countries that have most experience with h5n1 , have filled with the drugs that are already gone .
and i think even our leaders would say that we have a lot of to do a lot .
i &apos;m excited to answer your questions .
our centers for <unk> have developed one of them designed to have a little bit of a little bit of <unk> .
and in the most common diseases in humans , they were not a problem .
don &apos;t just pay attention to how much fun you have it , but also how the power flow completely changes completely the way to interact with a city like san francisco .
please put me a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to get me with a young juggler , and he was going to sell me three clubs .
i played with my childhood , i played with <unk> and climbing , which is done . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a <unk> .

because of the <unk> sheets and branches , it &apos;s very dark in the air , very dark .
i and my colleagues of interest are interested in the dynamics of the <unk> that live in the forest .
we &apos;re advising us with media media ; we have a <unk> ; we have <unk> .
and then students came into our lab students , and they took their own beats with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to grow the frog &apos;s frog , which is highly highly transmitted from endangered endangered endangered species in states in washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; see what you hid in front of you . &quot;
so we see a rising demand for <unk> , and therefore we &apos;re so .
they &apos;re not magicians . they &apos;re not our parents .
you &apos;ve got to believe me . trust me . &quot;
i learned two really important things that day .
the deeper we go underneath water , the higher pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
and the air is out , the air goes out , the air comes out of the air , the air comes from the .
each of these computers can run all the system , so if two of them are missing , there are reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat extends over , over many miles .
so sharks are not quite as dangerous as most people are .
when we found it , we were not even sure what family was heard , so we called him <unk> &#91; after the <unk> &#93; because he looked like it looked like he looked like one of his books .
oxygen toxicity caused a solar system and it &apos;s hallucinating .
this means that every and each one of you knows here at least a child that &apos;s suffering from a woman .
and his communication and social interactions improved so much that he could visit a normal school and actually became a <unk> .
it &apos;s something like life : if you &apos;re just in there , you can &apos;t get out again .
i know you never heard of him . but you &apos;ll tell you this day , someday you &apos;ll hear about him , because he &apos;s an amazing man . &quot;
nk : no , he died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , loved everybody .
we all of us , are what happens when a hydrogen structure of hydrogen and helium trains that they start asking themselves about their origins .
these <unk> evidence prove that life can exist in many different environments .
so you have to learn the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first step , to make yourself in contact with life elsewhere in all .
so it &apos;s going to be this as important as aluminum , and we &apos;re going to expand it in the future by increasing it on 350 antennae , so it &apos;s sensitive and moore &apos;s law moore &apos;s law .
and then we would like to improve the most well-meaning search by human health .
many say , it &apos;s the best place in the world to investigate the development of climate change .
each cylinder is a time of time .
while they &apos;re blowing down with the ice , you &apos;re going to put a pair of gloves in an oven , so you can put a new pair of pair of pair of pair of <unk> , and your fingers are stiff .
i think this point is a little bit of <unk> .
and our soldiers don &apos;t really happy to get a conversation in <unk> in <unk> , if they were actually introduced to service to <unk> american <unk> .
you can continue to keep it further , and efficiency almost have a few of these kinds of <unk> improvements and so the business of the big scale rate .
we could build bigger cars , which would make safety , but easy to be able to be .
but instead they sell it to china and japan because we have our <unk> health care and not the other .
and it &apos;s actually by the <unk> of the building of materials that kind of materials , or in this case , to manufacturing , as good as good , the <unk> system can do as well as it was the <unk> system .
it cannot simply act a gigantic <unk> conspiracy .
there were two kinds of negative feedback that we &apos;ve got .
we hope that it really is going .
oops , i &apos;m wrong .
and he found a <unk> , a dutch <unk> named viking van meegeren sold him a wonderful vermeer to a prize that was about 10 million dollars .
according to his favorite version , he looked like he was discovered for the first time that there &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s going on . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive you find them how much they &apos;re attracted to or romantic , depends on what you think about who you think about .
but each one of these three objects has value beyond what it is because of its history .
but i don &apos;t want to copy , even if i couldn &apos;t recognize the difference .
so he hired joshua bell to take his <unk> back into a subway station in washington d.c. , to see a corner , and see how much money he will take .
the second shock hurts less because you &apos;re a bit of it .
and if you &apos;re looking at , you can see that there may be some kind of political <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> that they &apos;re a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of <unk> , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat vegetables and olive olive oil , less <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the fascinating things in the world &apos;s entire world .
it &apos;s a final ending , if you give a drug in such a high dose that they have more effects effects , and that your drug will look better look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem , for that , right now , there is no solution .
and very soon they would have begun , this coal &apos;s coal , 2,000 2,000 dollars , <unk> around 2,000 , <unk> around the world , <unk> to china and all around the world .
can you imagine how you feel if you were in my point ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know , all that know .
there &apos;s this thing that &apos;s the world &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they are christians .
man , americans , they &apos;re kind of like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
they generalize . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldier are chinese , and all other are chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of you sitting down on his kid tomorrow and it hugging and she said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back out of them afterwards .
everything has changed .
and all this has been enormous impacts on the world .
i think thomas jefferson has been given very good in words .
for the most competitive in the audience , even explain why they have a bigger budget than a high budget , which is because it &apos;s easier to translate into different languages and cultures . so the market is bigger for these films .
but it will happen within this century .
this isn &apos;t the u.s. states of america , which is about a million , but gdp per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
also , like everybody here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the pinnacle of a life-long obligation that started growing up in the local coast of the south coast .
a lot of our actions on this planet that are concerned about our living environment are only by faith and guesses .
one has been a many or millions of years .
we need to calm us down before we ruin the planet .
e.o. wilson : saving life on earth
another one is the famous european <unk> .
the breast pigeon , contains 1.3 billion base pairs .
the reversal of extinction falls into this category .
real falcon , pretty much meat .
there &apos;s a program that &apos;s a program that &apos;s just brilliant .
this is an emotional theme . some people got up .
my grandmother was housewife .
i also made my own comics , which was another way to tell stories , through words and images .
and we sat down , just like this , in silence and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re truly talented . &quot;
use your own style . draw not how you say it .
&quot; rather jarrett , i &apos;ve got your <unk> .
i &apos;m going to publish a book called &quot; <unk> police : the <unk> who &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us all all the constantly physiologically , psychologically , cognitively and <unk> .
this is a 32 million pounds , very important , which recently built in england designed by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not only children who are affected by it .
people who say , don &apos;t let the team next to this team because the noise may need and your rest .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary businessman that his life in a suitcase with himself , and it &apos;s not able to do it between dream and reality , and not able to get both .
<unk> <unk> and four four years and a half years and jobs later , what started as a welder was a <unk> of <unk> who was practicing .
i know that theater connects us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create an intelligent and advanced work . and linguistic .
if you look around the mountain , you see some products more , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also , but also toothpaste .
<unk> collagen -- or since the 70s , collagen of pigs -- used to inject it into fold .
all of all , i found some variety of products .
and i &apos;m saying : &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve got a long and a year . &quot;
i told you , you should be like this : &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they gave me feel to be somebody , in a time i was like one one one one was like one one one one was .
they just work on paris in this morning , and now it &apos;s going to be the alternative p p .
hundreds of verbs can do this .
you can see this as the language of thinking , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is why deliberately deliberately deliberately deliberately become careful requests , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
you can try to imagine what would be if language could be literally used .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have any problem .
here &apos;s my argument . is it durable ? is it good ?
it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what is what we won to convince me ?
all these different roles , can you imagine an argument where they participate , but also sitting in the audience and watch the debate ?
or -- and this is the most important thing for me : we want it to do it in the world of nature . we bring a <unk> and find the master of the nature of nature that could inspire us .
this changed all . from there , these engineers were not going to go into the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the most primitive national lab .
this would be <unk> for fuel cells if you could do without any <unk> .
this isn &apos;t easy because life has only a subset of the elements in the world .
feel and react : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see is not counting .
my first business was a <unk> . i started underneath the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia are almost half a million companies .
because , as the <unk> , smaller <unk> in direct context , they are more economic economic rights .
and the world in all world are no exceptions .
people were doing whether this <unk> and this wonder .
i &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> of happy , himself <unk> cows on my dorm room and i want to use paper towel for <unk> .
we did it first .
what does this mean ?
when i started to do with them , i found that they &apos;ve been incredibly good adapted .
but the researchers had a problem .
until they finally graduated from and the campus -- and i &apos;m sure that they were going to come out there -- and then we came back back later and discovered that crows still remembered them .
we found that they are really smart and they can teach each other .
squirrel would come back to you would come out for the peanut and go back .
but there were three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about it , but more importantly , i found a <unk> .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen because every region has something that could be done .
let me make connection .
you know that the future of the future is . you need to understand this .
this is much too much .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny <unk> of sound .
about 10 million prescriptions .
and here we see here , in the words of israel israel , &quot; how the hand takes the penis into a way that remembers the <unk> . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yeah , but i would rather be going to end up when you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should make an experiment .
he had one line in his book that was supposed to be from the <unk> , there was a <unk> maria <unk> , who had trouble with conception .
so they have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i got to read you what she said , because i think it &apos;s such beautiful .
i find this very unfortunate , not because i would have used it . i wanted to see him .
and this is actually the beginning of our history .
now i would have thought to this moment that at age 50 , one of the skills i really understood was to bind my shoes .
first i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yeah . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know where he &apos;s supposed to be the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that they &apos;re still a bit skeptical .
it called &quot; <unk> &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after some time i decided i had some fun , and before i left the room morning , i &apos;ve got some things in the room .
and now they are all in here .
my father was one , my youth was interesting .
this song as mere fact .
i &apos;m , &quot; wait , yeah , i &apos;m going to put the wheels . &quot; o protest bought the wrist wheels , and i built them out and -- look at my name ?
it just sounds like , but i think that we generally have in our society and culture with the culture of the culture .
he had designed the <unk> himself , and he was really proud of it .
human , i love this thing .
the consequences of a planet that are already seven billion people live .
especially pride was on the goddamn seat , the really arrogant seat he had had his <unk> , and he had his favorite <unk> around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- knowing that original life lived something better .
i saw the healthy mass of a left and i was sure she was lost , <unk> all what i haven &apos;t done yet , but couldn &apos;t be possible .
then i started thinking about how many times before i was different , if i couldn &apos;t have hurt me if my genes had had a different amount of experience .
i was i was , but i was now despite a <unk> myself and i think i &apos;m myself myself myself .
i had hoping to something much simpler hoping : this turkish <unk> against four words and make me back back to my journey .
he spent six months in prison , lost his family care for a decade .
yeah , contrast .
we work with the machine <unk> laboratory at the university of california , san diego combined .
first , the perception of humans , and secondly , a natural interface , a natural form of control , so that interactions with the robot is intuitive .
and yet i made this idea to raise this idea .
after i recognized this economic risk , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some of these have actually credentials events to the speakers , like nathan <unk> style , or one one of tim ferriss who may be looked at as a surgeon .
i know no tedtalk that includes this .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i found that job was something harder .
and yet , there was one where all of sure were sure : the expansion needed to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in mind because i &apos;m going to call them three main principles in string theory .
the <unk> has gone up about 10 up .
and he was working decades of explaining this number , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes has added dimensions .
because the astronomers today , by making powerful telescopes to heaven , find a handful of <unk> photons -- a kind of <unk> <unk> , billions of years .
now , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it . we want to make them really more and more interesting .
he said , &quot; go , milo . &quot;
pm : this is dimitri so right in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know there .
the next moment , the telephone doesn &apos;t work on the phone , the tv group is going on , armed men in the street .
it was a very grim meeting of the reporter who worked in war , who were armed by aid agencies , and of course , courageous , brave people of sarajevo .
if i &apos;m asked , why i &apos;m going to do why i &apos;m going to stay in this room , that &apos;s why .
but it &apos;s my profession this testimony to the <unk> , and this is the core of the core , for us .
even before a goal appears to be with the joystick <unk> cursor <unk> , aurora tried to find aurora in the target where it is .
basically we &apos;re the animals to use these kinds of <unk> to control these kinds of objects in virtual world .
in an experiment we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju was finished the <unk> .
please raise your hand .
the last reason has done to do with that women are part of the solution , not the problem .
niger dies in average , one of seven women dying in birth of a child .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , when he was <unk> the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good that investment in education in the developing world are the highest amounts of security . &quot;
this is bill <unk> &apos;s book .
and this was the feather of a bird .
this whole eddies around one of our main lines , tells us that there &apos;s a <unk> .
and even this image makes the suspected impression that seemed to be <unk> -- like something from the <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> circus .
one of these ways was that we could have to have a little bit of a little bit of .
you put your arrowheads and say , &quot; i want to trade these arrowheads against finished arrows . we share 50 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can meet all three or four miles on a new language .
if 27 individuals made up of these 27 member member states to a table , their 23 languages , then they &apos;ll say a easy calculation that they need an armed of <unk> <unk> to be prepared for all of the possible possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they had language .
and what interests me most is the invisible space between one text text and the different image , and how the image is changing through text , and the text through the image .
this is <unk> <unk> that are running over the bottom of the atlantic ocean and connect north america with europe .
they &apos;re making the negative .
but through the impression of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> can change the change .
larry <unk> was eight years of a half a half a half a half a half of a sudden , arizona , in arizona , for kidnapping and repeating of a <unk> boy .
so they are just going to be out of themselves .
and they &apos;ve brought them to us for us .
and now they drive with the food , where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the vastness of space that makes it look like that is not happening .
something called hooked on a feeling : the quest for happiness and human design .
partly partly because this is the present , the <unk> , which was hoping for happiness for severe sense , it will be driven by most aspects of the individual and couldn &apos;t find in reality .
a <unk> in science is happiness , happiness and adversity no <unk> in a closed-loop continuum .
it starts in the <unk> .
here &apos;s three weeks old baby .
in the animal kingdom there &apos;s only one opportunity to increase status , this is dominance .
i want to conclude with some quotations .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat has understood that , we make a bit bit bit .
you can actually cure t.b. , even people who are hiv-positive .
knowing that a patient , the <unk> , is to be infected to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , they can be secure that we &apos;ve been saved many lives .
here we see neurons .
so this is important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question is : if i just watch another person , why am i not confused this blade of music , literally watching this blade of horror as someone touched ?
thank you . i &apos;ve got two missions here today .
i don &apos;t really about the <unk> , but it &apos;s about the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken through a <unk> by the lab in the lab of kew .
even every single one of us has a own story to tell us the <unk> .
we need to be as good as the cancer campaign to address this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980s , when we were women and death disease , they wrote an article for new england journal of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , x-ray , <unk> , for women , their breast heart is a heart of the heart , every time we organize something that includes a little bit radiation , we ask , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they &apos;ve done what they said they were <unk> and they were given .
the cells have something like <unk> ; in the dish they don &apos;t feel humanity .
what does this mean for us ?
we took eight to 10 hours every day , they were raised about a <unk> hours of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> that came out of something more than a year that really surprising to us .
and finally , my son is alone in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project philip zimbardo : rony <unk> and <unk> roy are here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in play .
this is the first time that our son made more than two steps -- captured in the movie .
and this is a important question to ask , because how better we understand how the brain makes meaning , the better we can communicate . i think better , i think better we can think and work together .
it &apos;s kind of a center where you see an image and think &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to the context . &quot;
what we literally do is , our teams , to paint our teams to build the entire wall cells .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just hygiene , but it &apos;s also about for a chance .
so don &apos;t build it there .
if you translate this into the industry industry , if you put a <unk> and a window , we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken up .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we &apos;ve continued to put on .
are we just stupid ?
you can browse it in two years if you read eight hours a day .
so you can be able to be able to be able to be <unk> in september .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why do you do this ? &quot;
and the police are waiting on the nest maintenance workers to cut the vehicles into pieces to get the body seat .
and this is enough to the present in the present , in the united states , in which one eye finds a divine mirror .
all this leads us to -- <unk> , just to name this : what we &apos;re most doing is to use digital devices .
this is the implication of destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right side of the bar .
this is a very , very low level to go out of the health care .
he would hold my jaw in the right position while he was throwing my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and inventor , who is fascinated by the gaps in consciousness whether he would be hearing the ears , or a blind that &apos;s a blind or a blind .
now i had to follow in the dark years , which would find out what was given when everything that was happening today .
and it works . it works .
so , if you have the opportunity , they spend time with simon .
and these were developing countries : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and they &apos;re on this page . a big schism of africa and the one of the things here .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought the country back to a middle .
a search search that we can copying data into a three-dimensional format and share the world , and what do we hear when we look around us ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained life after it was achieved , what was the essence of life ?
and then i learned my researchers there .
but there was what in literature .
we weren &apos;t the best chemists in space .
i was distressed ; my girls didn &apos;t marry me .
you can basically compare dna to artificial segments and other areas .
and so close to me , i &apos;m telling you that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
average , the defense costs in such two million dollars and takes 18 months when they win .
first , don &apos;t you fighting against the patent , but against the patent .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;m going to make it disappear with the <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; &quot; girls ask .
the fathers were in a place where they move their daughters to play , their chairs and their hand could reach out .
this is a great technology .
there &apos;s not much left in the world .
it cannot survive for a long time in humans .
and if the enemy isn &apos;t seeing most of the time , and so we needed another way to eradicate polio when we had done it with smallpox .
it has helped control pandemic networks , sars for example .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : bruce where are you from their perspective of the toughest ?
bruce <unk> : how we get polio polio
dj : we found this <unk> in all kinds of animals , especially in big big big .
and we were a <unk> .
for us , this elephant in many ways has become a symbol of this hope that we &apos;re accompanied with our work .
it was incredibly amazing than she took it in safety to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these <unk> , which became the <unk> , she reminds me in a very scary way of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny is in our hand .
we need it . we &apos;re respect and celebrate each other as man and woman as a community and as part of this planet and we need to continue to move on this .
after all , it seems obvious to be clear that the earth is big and <unk> , the sun small and flexible , but it &apos;s worth remembering what <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s because in middle middle kingdom of aerodynamics always .
nature of this model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , and because between you don &apos;t agree with their favorite , <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , as we see it in middle world , <unk> and solid .
people as machines are to treat scientifically , scientifically , and it &apos;s a more profitable time of waste if you want to guess what the job gets going to do next .
i was going to be a <unk> <unk> at night , at the end age of 40 years .
and about an cursor i control my head , let me give me these <unk> videos to see videos from robots to see the robot by sending orders by blowing buttons in a concert .
with the help of people like you can do this dream .
in society , for example , a <unk> lexicon of the <unk> , basically , the <unk> that are beaming out the dolphins .
i think together we can form a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
there are some lessons -- there are some lessons that you can learn from it .
but normally we don &apos;t normally do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is now 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i also suppose most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- which is really sad when you consider that this is the common language on the internet .
what are you looking at ? maybe we should do it .
if you look at this picture , you may think , &quot; why should that be interested in ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to take out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and safety , religious violence and ensure that states never even <unk> terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is this ?
i love this court .
and the war was that the 20 million people took life -- until today , the civil war was worldwide .
<unk> williams , who &apos;s this guy : &quot; i would have all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all this time to searching for american man who had stolen my prescription .
chinese restaurants have done mostly the same , i would argue with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized headquarters .
so in contrast , general tso chicken , which began in new york city in new york city in early 1970s , when i was just beginning at university in new york city in new york city .
so what we see in the 17th , 1700s , the <unk> search for medicine is about <unk> that creates the same .
so people would have really big seizure .
when the <unk> began to get less , i was clearly going to get down until i thought my god , i couldn &apos;t work anymore .
remember , to take a child on every line ?
18 and 19 , i slept night .
over time i &apos;m going to get depressed and thinking about it .
many of us is clear that there &apos;s lots of things that we have to do in the next years in building a better world .
he goes around : &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know . where did the world work with the treatment of the known problems that arise from the potential of haiti and climate change ?
if you do the impossible , you do it possible .
but we &apos;ve reached an agreement on climate change .
and there &apos;s god crying .
the <unk> makes something remarkable : it uses two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their spinneret to create a material that is being extraordinarily hard , like that is like technical fibers like kevlar .
or you &apos;re nice things like this , if the camera can capture this .
here you see what it &apos;s recorded from tissue .
with my new project , marilyn <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s the same soft and the applause and the <unk> -- hopefully not -- to help him make some of its next decisions .
what do i do ? &quot;
and then i &apos;ve never begun demonstration in this unprecedented demonstration , heather knight , a <unk> , which can be far more than <unk> -- he provides the feedback of his audience and how this behavior works on the answer .
stanley carrillo , inventor of the known <unk> of <unk> , suspected in the <unk> and <unk> , that there were between two to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships to all groups ?
but there was a truism that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where i might have given me this bug .
oh ... my dad , a <unk> ?
it was his father who decided they needed false papers .
this emotion of accountability about life &apos;s life , despite his young age of 17 years , and also his blame to be a <unk> , because he was gone from a camp , his friends kept his whole life .
and during my battalion and my dorm meeting were given up , i was making my father false papers .
i asked him , given the victims that he had had had ever been to do it .
we grow from a few million people to the seven billion people that we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> , on a level of <unk> , which seems to be in a good state .
if you &apos;re the forests , the border in the border , you &apos;re going to keep the ability to be able to stay stable .
mit knowledge of <unk> , fishermen , the great barrier of <unk> reef and scientists that the great barrier reef is under the current barrier reef under current .
but the drama is of course , of course , showing clear that that climate change isn &apos;t any option .
this leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really love media .
this is a <unk> of a long developed developed .
first , it &apos;s an ancient way of manufacturing , and it connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a new technology at this time .
and by the process of sugar on black suits , i hired portraits of them .
there were very big pictures , and i took them with a very big camera , a <unk> camera .
my interest in education , especially bad enough , very far .
and further back there is a sequence that is even in chimpanzees .
we then ask questions : are there &apos;s general differences between africans and ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living today .
we can then ask us to these denisovans for these denisovans , like neanderthal : have you mix with neanderthal people today ?
there are many people who designed their own future future , like this vision from the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane of the future has his own consciousness .
imagine , <unk> grow in 3d 3d printers , and they &apos;re embedded in a <unk> , and follow the forces that occur into their components .
they weren &apos;t talking . but especially they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from people .
they would be <unk> . they would call the police .
we we know that it &apos;s about one of 100 .
you see a video .
you have felt that the research that you &apos;ve engaged in , really can have an effect on reality , that they actually avoid these experiences that i started my path on this area .
then you pick up .
so , you &apos;re sitting in a rigid body posture -- chin on the <unk> , arms extended over your <unk> .
they did all exactly as we &apos;ve taught them .
and after the battle you bring this mobile lecture and do what you call &quot; <unk> &quot; to teach you what you did wrong .
and people have changed .
i asked , &quot; where is it ? &quot;
this is not a little bit .
and she showed on the left work to tell me , how hard this picture was that it was for her to the idea of how black represents .
it &apos;s really in this sense of <unk> that i have a new series of questions that i &apos;m asking .
well , this is kind of an obvious statement .
and the children said , &quot; how shall we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you get your attention to you before you decided you haven &apos;t understood anything ? &quot;
their <unk> increased on 50 , which is new schools new in new school with an internal schoolteacher .
was 76 percent . when you test , two months later , this was 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be da vinci .
that &apos;s 10-year-old .
suddenly i saw the dark on the dark side of the space , the <unk> of the moon , which were the moon on the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it ?
i &apos;m going to show you some excerpts from my other big project here in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm storm .
and our little life ends into a sleep .
bono : they are <unk> .
i know you understand this .
so , blue , blue , everything became blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of them play in africa .
it &apos;s another thing acting on the interface interface and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the <unk> of the we have , and find out what price would pay for that they would pay for that they would have the vote .
thank you .
the <unk> was this : if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two <unk> and 10 tv .
and this little bit of <unk> to remove out of its tracks , and this was a problem .
this is good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models i work with .
and that &apos;s creating tissue density and behavior behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually the key to use these models for the design system .
thank you .
and trying to do it just like trying to take an arrow to the end end , and it was hard work , and boy , boy , boy , i learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even more problematic developments , as <unk> as <unk> -- darpa , california institute of technology and university university .
be careful , just like like like wood or like this .
now i didn &apos;t try to be <unk> .
they &apos;re going forever .
this is about two billion .
it requires about three years of <unk> .
don &apos;t forget that you &apos;re going to run off .
but for me , this is great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we live in the human understanding and machines together .
i &apos;ve got quite significant . where does she come from ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the way that could be gone away in 20 or 30 years .
all the evidence of evidence is that this cancer is transmitted by a virus .
i took the opportunity true and sampled some samples from jonas &apos; bush and some samples from different parts .
she brought him to him and this discovered something that was called a little bit .
ultimately cancer is a very ubiquitous outgrowth of our cells to share and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomena .
they would be waiting for waiting for it .
and this is the third reason why low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t feel that the numbers are on them .
first i &apos;m going to show you the optimism bias for optimism optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion doesn &apos;t break , if we realize this kind of <unk> .
but then what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , that gradually coming back to more than half the world &apos;s population is to grow over half the world &apos;s population .
you could look at this as the privatization of the fittest .
after 1958 , the soviets had sputnik <unk> , &quot; it said , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or new or new view of china &apos;s ascent something different than if you live in beijing lives .
and if we have strategies where we &apos;re going to get this into greater historical context , we &apos;re able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests , so it doesn &apos;t only be a <unk> <unk> , but not only a positive amount of money .
this is the conventional approach .
this has typically accountability accountability to <unk> to use a stable diagnostic system .
they are addicted to each other .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after most legal system has collapsed , you can &apos;t even get property .
they would be able to get the dignity of their own , after the conflict , government .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has realized . they call climate change a system that threatens security and stability , as governments are facing how to respond .
it allows you to become more productive , so they can do even more more than the insurance themselves .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions if we feel able to feel a more inclusive world .
listen like chinese students practicing english by shouting .
teachers : perfect ! students : perfect !
and this includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , abstractions , which we &apos;re trying to do logically consistent , and we take the hypothetical seriously , which means we &apos;re asking us more what could be as what &apos;s .
luria looked at people before they put into the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a taxonomy of the concrete world .
there &apos;s luria said , &quot; north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north north
they chose <unk> instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the distribution of cognitively demanding professions .
would they deserve it ? &quot;
they could say , a half circle .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they were willing to do anything to do anything .
he &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris created with personal sacrifices , this film .
i &apos;m one of your favorite .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is seriously .
we were all mad to them : &quot; why do you do this ?
it &apos;s going to be much true if you read him . &quot;
we &apos;ve always played the game after weeks , about seven weeks , and we &apos;ve all had all 50 of all 50 together all the 50 boats .
and we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
many people announced paying jobs and <unk> themselves .
it &apos;s like its own small connection .
if i put all three legs from this , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very <unk> proposition -- this old <unk> and this old plastic , and this old plastic , and this <unk> is just a very simple thing in an old <unk> .
this is possible if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> paper -- you can be in a <unk> school or a government school -- a sheet , a rule and a pen , no glue , no glue , no scissors .
what we do is a very simple thing .
this is a little straw that you do is these two sides here , it &apos;s going to be like a <unk> .
here are two magnets .
there were lots of passengers on the ship , and they became bored , so the captain invited them up .
at the conference conference conference , <unk> gupta shows <unk> simple and yet amazing plans to create waste in really functional , constructed toys that are able to build kids themselves -- while they learn basic principles of science and creation .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that we were able to provide many evidence .
and there are some examples of projects that are inevitably trying to mimic ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can transform a place of traffic into a transforming , open space for people that connects people back together with food and transformed into opportunities .
this photograph was done a day of completing this day , and only one year later , looked like this .
if you put sea cups , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you need to explore people &apos;s souls to the visions of the corals . &quot;
i sought somebody who &apos;s jewish because i &apos;m jewish and i &apos;m jewish and i &apos;m very important .
but the actual thing that was that there was lots of men who wanted to go out with me .
very few of us have the ability to be totally honest with themselves .
he likes to travel , as long as it isn &apos;t on a <unk> .
i tried to be basically <unk> .
because you remember my favorite version : you need to achieve a $ 700 points , and nobody did this .
most of them . <unk> are 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the <unk> demographics of the <unk> , the average of the music is the average of tomorrow .
imagine your vision is very , very good .
these are also many different benefits in terms of attention , and one aspect of attention that is also enhanced , is our ability to follow objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to see this outcome , and put it into the context of another group of <unk> , one group that actually looked up in our society , which is from people who operate multimedia-tasking .
let me tell this step with a job called mental colony .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just let all kinds of programs in particular if we look at , run .
so it was a big , very complex project i was not even sure whether it was working at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and lots of things .
on one page we have mathematica , with its kind of precise , <unk> language and a large network of <unk> developed capacity , capable of doing a few lines of just just a few lines .
so , with physical wisdom , we &apos;re used to use it to go around the world and realize that certain materials are meaningful for certain technological purposes and so on .
i was quite excited about the discovery that there was candidates , universes with incredibly simple rules that have been successful in general relativity , and also the general relativity of relativity and gravity and at least evidence of quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during this time i lost more relatives , and teachers who have me to do with hiv / aids .
they jump up . they &apos;re wearing red clothes .
because my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a fairly estate on capital and automatically was all about my family had , anyway , so he had this right .
and the day before the actual ceremony we danced , we were excited , and all night not slept night .
he was wearing sneakers and this in a village that didn &apos;t even have been a road , very attractive roads . it felt very attractive .
i promised him to be a <unk> girl , i would come back and do anything they would ask after .
if it was pregnant before marriage was was paid for this and punished it .
while we talk here , 125 girls will never get gone again .
consumers who represent 72 percent of the american gdp , actually , actually , just like banks and businesses , to dissolve their <unk> , in daily life , themselves to help themselves from consumers and risks that are going forward .
and what you see here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually actually have <unk> , and basically in the future education , the future children of our households .
<unk> are over 48 percent , then google institute .
we also see an trend towards something called <unk> tourism . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and beyond the neighbors &apos; emphasis on .
we also see a big <unk> .
the trend is the trend is enormously .
then we take the phenomena of <unk> .
and then i came up the question , am i the only thing that does something like this ?
you could exploit them .
this is what i do in my life -- stories tell stories , and i want to write with you some stories about art art , and also about some supernatural creatures , the <unk> .
our transportation cells could shrink . our hearts could be stunted . and our ability to do our own risk of food , if we &apos;re still alive too long within our cultural counterparts .
there i came up for the first time i call it called &quot; representative foreigner . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no refugee or a <unk> , i &apos;m going to ask why i do that . but this wasn &apos;t allowed to get me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge matter because i was prosecuted .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could be a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe maybe that will be happy story , and my next book may write about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so you &apos;re using . you &apos;re using existing songs , they put them into small bits , they emit these bits together , put them together again and you get a new song , but this new song is clear from old songs .
instead , these laws and laws worldwide are more awkward as an property .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to wrap up what it cover . <unk> alarm : the <unk> of the telephone , by a symbol with his fingers .
our creativity comes from outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you realize your address ? &quot;
but actually , it isn &apos;t my blame ; it &apos;s from the newspaper &quot; guardian . &quot;
what beautiful is , you can probably see this limb there , a kind of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s almost almost like it &apos;s out of the limb .
our study of our progress system taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now this led to an understanding of nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be that atoms have a single core , with <unk> that circle around it .
this image shows a galaxy , a galaxy , with , you know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think she can ultimately be the most comfortable ideas for us , about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet .
this is here . this is home . that &apos;s us .
and if you click on each mouse and each touch of the screen we put on the <unk> and <unk> of our personal information all over our path through digital forests .
when our daughter sat on the concert , i asked her : &quot; will you put lots of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t have a <unk> .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much arguing and talked about my 27 birthday i was not going to talk about a day -- one day .
and they don &apos;t speak ...
and i explained with a friend who understood my language that i was john francis that i was not talking about life that i was not talking about this last time that somebody would translate my sign language .
well , i &apos;m working my backpack again .
i started talking again because i had studied <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i was thinking about every birthday , but never my decision to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i was worried that i was going to be able to get out and back again .
i felt like stupid because i had so much food in america , but my father died of hunger .
but i think that your gesture of love and care can save another one of the love joseph and change thousands of other <unk> , which still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than i expected to waterproof and light light , and making industrial services also .
but then i was very disappointed with my profession as an architect because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , empires , the government , developer .
and then the following year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe japan .
so i ask me , what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we are born , even in utero .
so fetuses even learn the certain language that is spoken in the world where they &apos;re born in .
there &apos;s a mixture of the influences that are individually inspiring and curious about the woman himself .
why should malnutrition lead to <unk> disease ?
but you can see a little bit of your eyes .
this trust in the <unk> is essential for any kind of animal development .
the audience are going to be on <unk> <unk> , which are very logically , but not with what happens before you . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it &apos;s actually taking us to smile .
you may remember this as the <unk> <unk> , okay . at the time , when the greatest deal of all time .
if you &apos;re an effect on unesco , and somebody says , &quot; what does you do for eliminating hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is playing a role .
for me all the music was got .
now if i use my software , the camera is using the <unk> , and it &apos;s registered the location of the car data , and you &apos;ve got an whiteboard .
i remember that the poor needed something to do something -- food , clothing , shelter -- whatever they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a <unk> of shame .
now i heard him talk about various reasons .
i was not asked to talk about a donation , which was usually my way .
it &apos;s about the history of the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving us some ways to get a way to report what she would confirm , a partnership isn &apos;t an partnerships , which is based on a traditional form of language , crazy can happen .
it &apos;s a very common combination , a very strong combination .
now , the moment is still beginning to start and it &apos;s palpable , very clear , that it &apos;s just a vehicle , only one tool .
how does the future of humanity ?
now i turn forward to the second big question : are we alone or are there different lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions show that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
look at this .
here &apos;s photographs of me .
the rate even doubling every 18 months and every single <unk> member of the <unk> knows that &apos;s the law law .
but what is with you ? what &apos;s going to do with you ?
they sail into your saucers across the sky and occasionally hijack them for experiments that parents wouldn &apos;t agree .
so we &apos;re interested in things like that .
so sometimes these experiments couldn &apos;t do these experiments at all .
and then i found out that the first technology came from <unk> million years ago in the form of <unk> .
we can learn lots of them .
and i see <unk> and try to protect my child because with such a child you don &apos;t give anyone alone , even a minister not .
and secondly , they said that she had a <unk> gang , but some of the tweaks for the trees .
until now our ancestors came through our ancestors in principle of adult individuals , because the fossils , the ones , missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> explores the origin of humanity in the vast ethiopia . he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a robotic child and what we can learn about our humanity .
and if everybody should keep all the rules , you need to be an effective system for the policy agency , because as we &apos;ve found that , they need to trust all trust .
it &apos;s looking at high seas because the continent was been reduced by the <unk> .
we need to work locally , but also the world &apos;s engineering .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol &apos;s says , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
this was a fairly good idea .
so to say clear , i &apos;m journalists , no technologist , so i want to design a sketch of how the present and the future will be .
and then i think we &apos;re all thinking about whether we want that that is our reality -- and if what it means for our idea of life and for everything that comes from .
it looks like crude oil .
the symptoms of the complex are that you have the strong and comfortable thinking , the right solution , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for new york times and explaining how it works .
of course we can .
and deserve lots of money .
it &apos;s higher than the <unk> of americans .
we &apos;re going to try and see everything goes wrong .
it immediately . &quot;
and then it was never tried again , but he couldn &apos;t prove the guess .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not wearable .
china wants to have achieved this in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yeah , it gets ugly , and yeah , it happens soon -- with safety of our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that comes up for us .
and here you come in .
and what we need to think about is : if you dance in your flames , what comes next ?
and we thought we can take these debt up to our children , but imagine you .
everything else is <unk> .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage of development is the cell .
this should be something amazing or ?
everything we get received is <unk> .
they &apos;ll be able to listen to your attention may be able to keep the sensitivity or a result of some things that we can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not 1,000 years in the distance .
we should ban these cheap , simple <unk> ban and nobody can use them for children . &quot;
and here we can see this overall score .
we can &apos;t risk to lose the trust of customers .
it only has only 500 and get 1,000 to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge jar of rice , full of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when they &apos;re even sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things we &apos;re talking about -- is a slightly less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s been the internet for more than 5,000 days -- but only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine that we &apos;re going to do is now a <unk> , a human brain , if we look at the rate , which is growing , there &apos;s six billion solar pumps .
now it isn &apos;t like this -- if you make a table and things work with work , a word document , they &apos;re not part of the web but they will be it . they &apos;re going to be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people are going to get the broader sense of machine . &quot; in some sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want to dissolve .
and the final point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be .
third , it will be more ubiquitous , our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week i was convinced that the second episode of jesus christ had occurred that there was sun <unk> moon , and i was given to the god of god <unk> and prepared for his <unk> .
these are the dead of <unk> .
and it makes everything . it makes it all logically .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas how we push things .
this is a project that we just completed a major seed system that came right from this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that develop .
and this led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas to do young people .
and finally one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each one of you is going to his neighbors .
so as we should pay fees .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage because we can affect our environment .
my story is that two brains . it may be surprising , our gut has a <unk> brain .
this is very , very important , very important , because there can be <unk> .
we &apos;ve learned to talk with the big brain , taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , eventually we were all like animals and then no longer . &quot;
these are men and women who can be even 250 stars in the night sky .
of course , the most enterprising monks did that .
the <unk> , the post that goes on the sun is actually a <unk> that reflect light on the edges that seems to the sacred <unk> of machu picchu , called <unk> picchu .
if you pray for the dead people , they make these gestures with which they &apos;re thinking about the thinking .
here &apos;s where the big mother has been the <unk> into the world that has the mountains of the mountains and the home country , which they call the heart of the world .
there are unique manifestations of human imagination .
this material that you all know is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s more like toxic white stuff .
i just stick in there , you fit in there , because in a hundred years my body can go back without a second back to the earth .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world and not to care about or care , because you &apos;ve got many alternatives .
first you start atoms in a special bottle .
i &apos;ve launched a competition for four years ago called &quot; dance your own . &quot;
my country is 10 trillion dollars .
and this is -- -- that &apos;s still much more than all the speakers in front of me and all the ones that come from me .
and she thought about my work on mathematical models that should encourage an understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audiences don &apos;t love -- from deep , cultural reasons , hold it for boring -- and find another pattern much more interesting -- head-tail-heads .
you can think about two ways .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of head and numbers .
back to more secular , secular , because you &apos;re dealing with uncertainty .
and only one percent of it is wrong .
he &apos;s saying : &quot; i suppose that one cot death penalty one one one more likely . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet fairly unlikely .
all the quality control , the enormous impact on the industrial processing , is supported by statistics .
the <unk> has maybe hundreds of thousands of lives around the world .
an intelligent power stops injury because the electricity is always from , until an intelligent <unk> is recognized . simple .
but on the other side , china is a <unk> . a concept of <unk> <unk> .
you have facebook , we have <unk> .
yet , the <unk> self can create a very strong force , which has never been in history of china .
so , chinese is looking at this business of reputation as real medium , not just just just just just headlines .
like a big ted , not ?
so in the last three years , in the last three years , it has changed through <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;ve done more and more transparent , because they have no access to the data .
more chinese , the chinese speech and human rights than their own , rather than a american privilege .
many of you know that the beethoven &apos;s beethoven was seven symphony .
i don &apos;t say that they can live no life .
girl : well , my sister can be pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his transportation department had been removed to try to determine the cause of death , why that sound was going to be a <unk> and his skull on the sides .
cl : joseph &apos;s phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i &apos;m going to do , in this darwinian audience , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s another thing .
in this critical point in the dutch story , my father was on the shore of the <unk> river near the <unk> river .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has been decreased since the end of the cold war .
my soldier use their weapons as instruments of peace .
peter van : why i took a gun
this program gets a shape and then spits 250 sequences .
this is a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , in the middle of the yosemite .
you cannot make &quot; not &quot; no . &quot;
i &apos;m really interested in both .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually an theoretical rationale for why technology developed in a darwinian fashion .
now , the evolution of our species took hundreds of years , and because of this interaction , evolution used to basically create technology , to create the next stage , which was the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can use a good place to use the third dimension .
over the last 50 years we had 28 percent of 100 percent more growth in dollars .
another big revolution is the <unk> .
to go back to our exponential growth of computing : 1,000 dollars of computing correspond to about the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and then we &apos;re going to get the full maturity of these trends , and they need to appreciate how many times how many how many how many of the screw that screw that screw through the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to this point .
they can make your blessing and <unk> .
they are harder , harder .
they were from the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , honey is nothing .
dopamine is apparently that material that is linked to the stuff .
and we then call this schizophrenia .
and he was so nice to post that and give us the resolution .
i alluded to talk about our little experiment experiment , they &apos;re a <unk> in the african plain .
september 9 / 11 has a <unk> . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own <unk> , and we have a product of a product .
i wasn &apos;t as good as he , but we managed to bring <unk> n &apos; <unk> , spontaneous chapman and bruce <unk> on a <unk> commission , and this was a great experience .
they said again , &quot; says , &quot; the truth &quot; and encouraged us .
musician and activist peter gabriel shares his personal motivation , with the <unk> <unk> for human rights and stories stories of active <unk> .
next ? we &apos;ve asked us how do they do this ?
he recognizes the problem and knows about it . the dance is his <unk> that allows him to orient .
the beetles are much less than the pill when they were doing on the ball when they don &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our most disconcerting experimenter .
we play a <unk> and watch what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
so , <unk> argument that fun is to come into these big adventures , not entirely with my experience .
or &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother makes a <unk> in antarctica .
so the whole point of talk to convince the vc is to convince you that they are entrepreneurs in which they invest and make lots of money .
and besides experience , a company or something -- no businesses has to be done .
there &apos;s no financially inclusive system where there was no problems .
from there you take them up -- on a solid , deep path up , right from beginning to end .
if i find somebody who made such a device .
no , they don &apos;t .
then they give me a quick <unk> .
even if competition works after old patterns ...
hopefully everything is positive , positive , positive , positive , positive .
if you follow my ideas , you will have a <unk> , very <unk> presentation . this is neat to <unk> who they are and to make emotionally .
i didn &apos;t know that that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of you is a beetles .
if you imitated something , you might have an effect on it .
and then if you have enough enough , you can click another link .
we are at the end of the table , on the last room , the innovation doesn &apos;t value innovation .
as we think and behave , our dna system is broken .
we have a <unk> memes -- seriously .
but forgive me , the problems today aren &apos;t the problems of industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very grim .
our thinking is backwards .
through a transformative change , change , like transparency , change , like <unk> , and collaboration collaboration , collaboration , collaboration , and not <unk> , these things are focused on outcomes .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are always made , the only possibility for us is to get rid of the old ones that are going to get rid of the old creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do this , and we can share bulgaria of play , we can transform bulgaria to better .
the magazine called <unk> , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me with the <unk> because the <unk> was owned at the time .
after i had her head aside , she was very -- i was got accepted and i was going to work for about six months .
i had a fire before nine days ago .
you know -- all of stuff .
my children , <unk> and henry .
we &apos;ve got lots of magazines , we did our homework , but where we were looking at , we were surrounded by pictures like this .
this image literally developed in seconds after letting me put the baby into the arms and i brought it over .
rg : oh oh .
av : taboo number three : your miscarriage don &apos;t speak -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general idea is that every aspect of my life has gone better for me to be better than i was born on the death of birth and family .
but you realize that you &apos;re willing to lose control in a wonderful way , what we think about our lives , our lives , and what &apos;s really satisfying .
rg : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with yochai gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a episode of &quot; star trek &quot; there .
we &apos;ve all seen these &quot; star tests &quot; with the <unk> .
imagine , big , already late tv , as you would play personal . john <unk> walker shows how footage on the exact <unk> and <unk> can be analyzed by the <unk> wings .
well , since we &apos;ve experienced this time of remarkable economic research , the longest recovery in history in this country .
but now , a few months later , how good politicians may always be in this to bite &quot; in the smartest apple without the mine &quot; like somebody who did somebody who would be somebody who can &apos;t be able to hide your uncertainty .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand this until i met this guy , a back time , amazingly chaotic man who was running from <unk> food and iron for completely <unk> .
but interestingly , interestingly , it &apos;s also a future where society is a few of the capitalism of capitalism , which is how you try the dna incessantly <unk> innovation in society , and then they try things and then those ones that work , <unk> and <unk> .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis and some surprising new findings that i &apos;ve worked on , about the context between the structure of language that they talk about and their slope to save .
and if i want to talk right , they force me to think about it all all .
now , this is a darwinian theory .
please please please show this device so you can get your hand hand , so i can measure your performance control .
it &apos;s the current pleasure in exchange pain .
i don &apos;t need to tell you how important the ability is to communicate across generations .
we were teaching teachers all all the time .
but i &apos;m about to use it as a hurdle .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
at the same time i was on the field of business school , although i was a ph.d. in <unk> .
people and <unk> and giraffes and birds and all that red line here goes up here . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused on serious climate rights in the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this is the night on the party overnight , and -- you can see how it just <unk> , and you can do any oxygen that you want .
and he was dissatisfied about how people practiced the buddhist religion in india during the time .
and he goes back as a <unk> man back to village .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the <unk> and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we we &apos;re out . we take a sense of memory to a mother and long that &apos;s all about all living living in this meditation .
and you think about how they are things when they &apos;re happy when they &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and <unk> against others .
although the change in your attitude is something that makes something for other creatures , you feel this new quality in you , and it &apos;s already helping you , and it &apos;s an model for you as a model .
so the coffee cup is , or the cup of handle , one of the society used tools to maintain public health .
interestingly , complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very easy if you know how it &apos;s .
okay , let me close with four <unk> remarks , an example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop you with detail , but you see an example of what we have .
did they start doing this ?
and here is what they &apos;re happening from the things that jimmy has talked about , what was our new kind of organization or better expressed , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things are always going to be able to be able to be able to use it in the process , working with the <unk> .
so let &apos;s take some astronomy astronomy , astronomy , which yochai mentioned before .
it &apos;s also going to be <unk> to arguments .
so there &apos;s not going to give a dispute of two camp , but between these camps are going to give all sorts of interesting positions that are taken from people .
this costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to put their <unk> to someone and actually made a team that we did : between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for it .
but the truth is that life is happening right here .
so people called the news , and they have news like this :
he said , &quot; i attracted like batman to be my anonymity . &quot;
and one thing that didn &apos;t have done , so they made it was just moved into another city and adopted a new job .
and over the last 35 years , i studied human behavior based on the basis of everything , from genes , dopamine and similar to the <unk> .
some of them have . and it &apos;s depend on gender .
this was one of these cases because there was no violence under their ancestors , but my father already .
they are similar to each other as you can be .
i &apos;ve got an email tomorrow tomorrow , which is that we &apos;ve completed the last part of atlas today .
and these guys here are the weak force that may be least known .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why atomic atomic hits you , they should be able to use it with a <unk> computer -- why dna has the shape that she now has -- -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- — — — — it &apos;s got -- — — — — it &apos;s got -- — — — — it &apos;s got -- — — — — it &apos;s got -- -- it &apos;s been -- — — — — it &apos;s got -- -- it &apos;s been -- — —
comparing is that the people in this room represent the higgs particles .
but it &apos;s really that with this theory of physics , at the moment of the big bang , a absolutely wonderful prediction , and the model didn &apos;t have been able to do with the goal that this is happening , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , transforming darkness into light and it allows it to see the civilization from all of all .
another big insight came from a study of wayne state in 2010 , the baseball cards of the <unk> <unk> player from the <unk> <unk> player from the <unk> years .
in a similar trial in germany , researchers use fmri <unk> to measure <unk> , and after they had <unk> <unk> in the face .
&quot; because the colors that they ordered , not the european standard , &quot; he responded .
&quot; safer ? why ? there were more police officers hanging around ? &quot;
we built the bright <unk> that people , people who were people who were to think that they were traveling abroad , when they were learning to get their concerns .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something , and you &apos;ve done it . &quot;
all everywhere in port-au-prince came together entrepreneurs and offered sell spots for mobile phones .
an visualization for the transformational power of technology finds in kibera .
by 2015 , there are three billion smartphones in the world .
in the stores stores , <unk> , batteries and bread .
this flow of time is embedded in everything : in the erosion of a <unk> , in the <unk> , which is the <unk> .
do you read an interview with a writer ?
and even there , if i look at the big bear , i remember how i &apos;m going to be a kid on his head to slide his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve always seen how creative technology can be and our lives and our do we can choose these solutions , innovations and moments that don &apos;t have the flow of time , but make it again .
my mother was <unk> .
every single refugee camp had had to be soldiers who had to be my older brother mark , who was nine , take take take take take a child child .
and i should do it alone .
take anything you want to have from the suitcase .
then i ended up in <unk> because i don &apos;t get my feelings .
thank you .
almost all life on earth is going to be wiped out about five times .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why should that play a role ?
so theoretically , we can grow any organ from any cell from any cell .
here &apos;s the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the upshot .
if the rotors is spinning with the same speed , the robot is spinning .
and you see how robust control is .
and he makes this while he obstacles obstacles .
they &apos;re taking your neighbors .
this shows that we double the energy rate , triple , we can see more than a second , where we get them to form teams as you can see here .
but the robot can find out where he wants to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s still so much and i want to extend here on your horizon , open awareness and change your view on honeybees .
this has been a huge problem for many years , basically , since the late &apos; 80s , that &apos;s the kind of <unk> that had many different viruses , bacteria and <unk> .
they don &apos;t experience this .
they take the cooks for their courts . and honey -- they use honey -- they use honey on their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they bite , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , now , now , ask yourself , why is this ?
of course , we &apos;ve got it , especially in the last decade , the world with a dense chain of <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before many people weren &apos;t aware of this fact .
in fact , not many of them don &apos;t know that our bread was not european invention .
and especially meat in <unk> and china is powering the air .
and it &apos;s got for most people , and there aren &apos;t many farmers among them to be bad , to be bad , to be really scale , to be in large scale , the environment .
everything is combined .
and while i did my bread -- and i &apos;ve got it out , and i &apos;m trying to burn your hands .
and also has to keep the country for long , with available tools to repair materials and <unk> .
you take somebody like me , scientists , analyze and tests and develop a new technology , and determines the quantitative .
because i hope you &apos;re going to take this today from here , a new connection with nature .
this was a few days ago in <unk> .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them . and shekhar kapur turned a film about her , <unk> queen , who should see you .
but i think most important is that we can do it .
but this is still <unk> as organized .
this is a very harrowing patient who was at the back 73 -- it needed to adapt to immediately , but i decided to do this .
i like this slide because you &apos;ll talk about what people really motivates to change , and not .
if you eat a meal meal , how feel you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans even eat more fat because ever , and even more carbs , so that percentage is lower , but the actual numbers higher , but the actual numbers are higher , so they &apos;re both to reduce .
one of the most recent studies of the <unk> studies found that 70 percent of people were clogged , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent had headache -- no percent had had a healthy diet .
on the other side , everything is , which is intimacy .
i hope he doesn &apos;t sit down .
the film is based on a <unk> of f. scott <unk> .
two main projects were involved in this project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to come through the <unk> and technology .
we we &apos;re so <unk> us from motion capture .
the numbers seemed seemed to be infinitely .
and these are the data we get from it , and then they &apos;re used for the model .
and so the finished picture looked like that was used in film .
this was a very , very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the state of karnataka .
and has a own <unk> .
people of <unk> are going to overcome these sweet , profound past where they lived throughout their lives .
we were too <unk> -- two bedouin than driver -- and imagine this large is an ocean from sand , 40 degrees c , a water bottle .
i think that camel is the best animal animal in the world . &quot;
and they use them as similar as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another movie .
i don &apos;t get to my body temperature down 40 degrees fahrenheit -- enough to weigh an egg .
<unk> , thank you for inviting me .
start a meeting with a poem . this was an idea .
but how would you weigh them if you never knew how you would have a living world like a living god , your shoulders in the clouds , or whether you &apos;re sitting down there , you &apos;re sitting down from wallpaper just straight off with your little ?
who could sleep at this night ?
but you knew that judy did 150,000 dollars a film that <unk> d <unk> <unk> the french army to victory and blaise pascal had his room tidied up -- no wait , i mean he invented the calculator ?
and at the end , she sat down in a tree and one opens your hand to another .
and human health is more than that , but you would take these columns , probably no longer would be left .
and then we have the problem that we have to do this problem that you can &apos;t build construction that was too heavy for an individual elephant .
one component of it is understanding . here &apos;s a <unk> : &quot; the ability to understand the emotion of others and sharing . &quot;
so we &apos;re exploring more more complex terms . here &apos;s comfort .
that test doesn &apos;t take good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple job that they have to do .
a philosopher was told us that it was impossible that monkeys had had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now there &apos;s no lonely crazy , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot of power .
so this last decade i &apos;ve spent my pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i need to say god thank you .
so i stopped , in some sense , it was successful .
over the years , this can cause severe health issues .
a.j. jacobs : how healthy life was seven .
and i think many people share this view .
really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically valid and they were reproduced , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask about the story of history that &apos;s not told .
... a priest ?
finally one group , who thinks that the indus people are the ancestors of people in today &apos;s human .
on the right , how many ? okay .
it can be useful to make more data that are then <unk> .
this sign is the most common script , and just in this text , it &apos;s twice .
it turns out that there &apos;s been a long tradition on the basis of <unk> at the basis of birth .
space , we all know what it looks like .
this zulu wire <unk> the <unk> that would make the names famous .
jansky did been made that the historical discovery that bodies can be able to get the same as well as radio waves .
actually all the young people of the city .
somebody sitting next next to you -- this is okay in a <unk> , you would sit on a <unk> , and somebody would sit down as close to you , then they would be able to get them .
the dalai lama likes to say -- he says , if you get the idea of the idea of the <unk> , it &apos;s because you realize that you are self and your pain eventually a small playground for your own intelligence .
but take this wonderful thing that gave us us . they blew us fear one with the <unk> .
a man was faced with a tank that was a symbol of the whole world was a symbol of opposition .
but what could they couldn &apos;t do anything if you had survived modern communications to make a sense that against the wrong that was going to be done before before , instantly ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate on global level and organize us globally with the challenges that are now focused on right now and most of global nature .
in the museum of children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a <unk> boy -- and the museum of children who were left in the life of the life of suffering from rwanda .
here &apos;s the job : help me to build a vibrant , <unk> <unk> in 3d .
they can move on very different forms of pollen -- they vary in the <unk> , the movement of the surface and the origin of the .
this is a driving algae .
boy : <unk> .
we slow down to see spines in action .
mark cutkosky cutkosky , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer that developed a technology called <unk> <unk> manufacturing , where it can claws directly in an artificial foot .
you see almost like from aliens , and the secret of what they put stick , they are their toes .
here we pull the band-aid off .
these <unk> structures allow it to be spines , <unk> and the <unk> , to capture very difficult surfaces .
so , <unk> long beautiful songs that are serving as a <unk> and men as females and vote each other .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet apart , they need to create less than half of the time .
if we think of marine marine animals like dolphins , we need to be able to be aware of the consequences of our surgeries we were fairly benign .
after the <unk> , the marine distribution has made these systems available to what we could hear .
they just hear the low frequencies .
if male and females are using this signal to find a mate and they are dispersed , imagine what impacts is endangered in the recovery of the population .
how they were made <unk> , they found out that with a better <unk> of this noise can be reduced to 90 percent .
they &apos;re going to cut down 50 percent .
we see foreign worlds , we see strangers , 300 , 300 , and they &apos;re always going to be more . and they &apos;re not like we .
you &apos;ve got all the possibilities .
we see a continuous growth in the men .
and obviously there &apos;s one , the hundred .
with tribes like 100 dollars , it &apos;s going to be thinking that we put together a whole new generation of people in the old <unk> computer .
thank you .
i think nothing about it is the problem .
but our daily lives is in a remarkable state , but say , in an extraordinary state , we say in a <unk> .
normally one or two per year .
and there are them !
but we are lots of healthy .
part of the challenge was to try and try and talk to the rhythm and not just my hands -- juggling is much more comfortable -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the feet , and the air with my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because you don &apos;t understand what a <unk> is , i give you a little bit of reference .
now again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have somebody up here , which is the most useful principle of doing this , right ?
slippers -- and then it comes down . just a little number over time .
and space and straight in the room works in the room .
and then <unk> levels .
this year -- you could show the slides -- this year we &apos;re wearing the <unk> with us , a project where we helped handspring .
we can put this on a <unk> program which allows it to put more information over the clothing of clothing , while you &apos;re these <unk> .
but scott adams : i found that i &apos;m going to be the foremost expert in the world &apos;s premier .
and we &apos;re also known a new product today , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s shown in public .
now , the farmers can only get in the rainy season , not in the commercial crops .
electrons disappear in a kind of plastic industry and then there &apos;s only energy , and energy can &apos;t see .
this is what he thought he was .
potatoes , 48 chromosome . did you know this ?
good . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what &apos;s sense of mind , henry ?
we &apos;ve got about four years about about four years .
if google digitized a book , they bring it into a very beautiful format .
i give you an example .
suddenly , in the 1940s , everybody was excited .
but imagine , no matter .
but also many right on the right , apparently they seem to have benefited from propaganda .
if you dig up the jungle , it means a &quot; <unk> &quot; with a a.
if i walk this pink sound for longer as a few minutes , they literally stop hearing it .
many people knock out to headphones , but this creates large , public spaces like this , shared <unk> , in millions of tiny personal personal .
you can also do it in a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , an acronym .
and i said , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you very much that you were here . we &apos;re all so appreciative . &quot;
and they went away .
because they weren &apos;t on the sidewalk and couldn &apos;t see the exchange that was between me and my <unk> , a exchange that &apos;s fair , but strangers .
now , i &apos;m saying , in the last year , there was lots of competition last year , because the arab spring still looks out , the <unk> is collapses ... what does ?
this photograph even was taped to a police department and see the <unk> of the people who were tracking by the police .
kids just make photographs in a class , the teacher receives them , they put them on the <unk> .
now today &apos;s talk about the brain and , b , somewhere out there , there &apos;s a <unk> .
this is something that we can work on our life . i could think i could do a difference , and so i tried to get out of the <unk> to get out of the <unk> .
but sometimes science has some other features that really make them interesting .
what do we get more data ?
there &apos;s something that we think it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as very intelligent , not in a human .
in humans , we &apos;ve developed the <unk> part of the <unk> called the <unk> part of the neocortex , nature has done this little trick .
it &apos;s not so that you look there and say &quot; what am i seeing ?
not like a <unk> . not at least a <unk> .
these are things that are coming first .
we need some police , we need some military , but just to defense .
you can see it on your search . &quot;
they traveled because they were the elections in elections .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then when she went down the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
they wash it like this .
this group uses three , everybody .
it &apos;s real .
she has managed to learn english and learn this as a second language .
the computer has already , and it &apos;s about three participants .
if you think differently , you think differently than the employers of the united states were actually part of our business , because we did this .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but then a delay between the enlightenment , how we deal with the data , and the actual onset of the <unk> .
the price of this is the displacement from paradise .
and they moved together and rubbed themselves and they were bouncing up their arms and put their arms down to each other .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you ask personal coaches , the <unk> like <unk> against bad breath in their breath .
i don &apos;t really feel like emotion .
the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to try to peer into other people and find out what they have .
they have <unk> humility .
this is what the subconscious mind is .
we found them between <unk> , raped from many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey recovers ?
and that it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : doing this process dictionaries .
well , first of all i blame queen because it &apos;s funny .
online online issues must be different .
the bad words -- see if somebody thinks in a place and don &apos;t find it on the map , then he thinks &quot; this card sucks ! &quot;
they think , &quot; ok , if we think words are tools that we use to make our thoughts , where you know that screwdriver are better better than hammer ?
the <unk> has 33 different definitions of definitions for &quot; set . &quot;
and then there was this mike , mike <unk> , mike <unk> lives in britain .
i &apos;ve got all the time &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , &quot; said &quot;
so i get a chair .
and to make a long story short , here i ended up .
and with this , play for play , for this three days , you start to understand : why am i hear all this stuff ?
you may be from a ted speaker , and so we can be able to keep the conversation during the year and next year , after the same year , the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers didn &apos;t have the producers in their cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not secure what the public would start to be so precise <unk> that could even fold fold on your palm .
there was no insecure whether it was already <unk> , and was technically not able to find the tag .
instead of directing the <unk> , you &apos;re fooling them .
and &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call us <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> and we live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a <unk> man .
we debate about the argument &quot; what the world needs now is nuclear power &quot; -- right or wrong ?
and now there are three main points of this -- coal and gas , water , which is almost all the time on -- and nuclear nuclear power .
we &apos;ve got the russian called &quot; russian warheads , by being transformed into electricity .
so , <unk> emissions are equivalent emissions of total gases gases and particles that cause warming , and co2 transformed co2 .
now if you look at the fact that the distribution of nuclear weapons is based on nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear weapons , because we know that india and pakistan secretly secretly developed weapons in <unk> .
for wind power is much bigger , but the water is smaller .
reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , or ?
and in the senate in the united states , we need the support of both parties -- only one or two voices are necessary to be in the senate in the senate , and this room can help it .
we &apos;re not getting enough sources enough power .
i used to worry about 10 years .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was was taken by apollo .
for the first time we have enough wealth in the hands of some few people , and the available technology that will allow us to explore exploration of interstellar space .
26 groups from seven countries were used in competition , every one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can bring them to the space station .
and the advantage for the funders is the sum of the <unk> and social health .
would you be surprised us ?
that means that space itself can cut itself . they can become incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can express this new algorithmic order in a pillar .
what i didn &apos;t know about time was because we only saw the outside , was that the surfaces kept moving on , in the column , in the pillar , which was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of cell division creates michael <unk> algorithms , the incredible ones , fascinating shapes with millions of surfaces , no person could design them by hand , but you could build our understanding of architecture .
so look at this image here -- lots of forms here here for them .
it &apos;s a very mild disease .
this is a drug that has developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip actually <unk> the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think many people here in the room , many of them are in the same position i .
so i think women are becoming leaders in our society because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations , to maintain our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve recognized that recently , more people have been able to use how youtube and social networks are using their stories to show their photographs and tell their own stories with their own voices .
at the same time we invite them to get come and explore our part of the world .
so i became more or less than &quot; nothing .
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i make these ants a few apartments , they pull out there . &quot;
this was called &quot; pink house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back the next day .
and it went ...
my work , critically estimated , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; you don &apos;t always have yet b.
and i took it round , and shaped it out of it .
so i broke the needle broke .
it &apos;s a very <unk> work , but the best things come into small <unk> .
they expect their employees that they &apos;re asking you to do you if they &apos;ve gotten done the job , you can do more extra .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , this absolute <unk> of consciousness , awareness , an absolute center of compassion and love that defines the primary nature of divinity .
my <unk> body flew into one direction , my <unk> wheel into the other .
i asked all the ones on the day i probably wouldn &apos;t do with you , the most <unk> i would not spoil them , the friends i wouldn &apos;t listen to you , the <unk> i couldn &apos;t get to you .
because you don &apos;t need the waste strategy .
and if you &apos;re going to leave you from back , against the wind , you can just shrink them over and it makes it <unk> . &quot;
20 years ago , doctors did my leg cut my leg off and hoping , and there was a 15 year-old chance chance .
how i became more and more empowered -- and at this point in my life i was probably 14 pounds easier than i &apos;m now .
and no one represents these modern <unk> in my eyes than david black .
walking upright , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international marriage for <unk> , which is least the least appropriate name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born three three months after three three months , and it was really a fantastic thing of him .
so soon as i tried to approach the piano , i became strong <unk> .
and at the end , you were so quickly that things like &quot; flight bumblebee &quot; didn &apos;t have any problem , isn &apos;t it ?
do you want to hear me play ?
dp : &quot; tiger <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t do this .
they &apos;re fighting their own life in this forest , in a world that &apos;s still clean , a world that doesn &apos;t even exist , in a world that hasn &apos;t yet yet .
we know today today that they are capable of willing to be able to be impossible for absolutely impossible than i started .
the long loving collaboration supporting connection that was developed during this long childhood , and then they can maintain all of life , and that can be the entire life , and that can be 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the big camp in the forest , they need meat and so they &apos;re going to be the pygmies that were running in the <unk> , and they lived in their wonderful life for many hundreds of years .
yesterday somebody said that .
now there are every state , and the problems in florida are others than the ones in new york .
come down and get me down here ?
there &apos;s politicians out there ?
what we want to do in the lab is so much the same , but with a few dozen different kinds of molecules -- such a <unk> reduction reduction in complexity , but yet trying to create something more inclusive .
it &apos;s even very <unk> . if you form , they don &apos;t really really do something .
now where they are all experts experts in protocells , we are going to play with these protocells .
we then see the self-assembly of these bodies from the <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs in this represent these black mud -- this <unk> , very complex , organic mud .
in his lab , martin <unk> , &quot; made the <unk> of chemicals that are like living cells , and his work shows how life on earth would come back to work on this -- and perhaps else .
this is a <unk> line to take your tadpole at the evening .
what &apos;s this -- where did they know ? they took it .
but if we did this for each other -- each fire hydrant , we could redefine the emergency .
soot is the filth , who &apos;s not the beautiful pink lungs , and it &apos;s filled with -- it &apos;s filled with -- it &apos;s connected .
the birds could jump from one to another .
they can talk about him &apos;s news stories . you can talk to him .
but embracing these flock , you &apos;re demanding a big toll of our planet .
next , we isolate the skin cells and multiply it in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working with thousands of years with <unk> , as wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we all do our research , we see that it almost is almost a universal pursuit of people that are going to have a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge amount of energy to create mobile energy .
if we can see this <unk> future , you can see others .
you had to survive .
and we certainly made sure our school school school school to get funding and support .
because why should our students drive so far away from chinese ?
it became a book , then to a demo .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here on the west west , they destroyed their forest .
but on this picture , you see how we started to build the <unk> , which was soon a big <unk> brazil .
and for me time , i came to start my school lab , i studied the <unk> subject of the <unk> research .
if you &apos;re blowing into the south , you see the expansion of new york city like it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the ones of protected places .
or the <unk> , the <unk> , insects and <unk> places .
maybe there was a <unk> .
there &apos;s so much force in this , science and visualization together , that they create pictures of the <unk> .
and we &apos;ve actually got a really dramatic level of it in our society .
so i don &apos;t have to get into this .
you make it untouched what &apos;s supposed to remain .
this is a <unk> building .
one example we all know is that cell phones .
and it turns out everything about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and selfish way .
but it &apos;s everywhere , and these tools are parts of them that help us .
seriously , seriously , they &apos;re quiet -- that &apos;s really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future
you could mean that this could be a big problem for a law , but congress doesn &apos;t seem to make it too much .
but if you produce lots of high-quality copies and sold , it isn &apos;t okay .
some of the things we share , we made things that we found and every single option causes horror in this industry .
this is the simple thing .
i had a very inclusive , <unk> , expensive training in india , and it almost made me broken me almost .
and i thought i start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is somebody , with a combination of competence , confidence and conviction .
when i said that , they said , &quot; you show us what possible . what do you do ?
all of electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , how you have to be the country , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re sick .
it comes into tension in there , drops the attendance , comes from teachers and parents , so puppets can call the teachers and parents say , &quot; give you your hands .
you use language language .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a <unk> .
and our main community create one of the biggest , dynamic <unk> computers in the world for this kind of <unk> .
you see here the <unk> along the world &apos;s <unk> , which we &apos;ve created as artists for scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m going to get it physically , financially , emotionally , mentally and almost every other way that much better . &quot; i don &apos;t know a minute .
he didn &apos;t put it money , and of course , he had the same idea of the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because you &apos;re in the experiment i &apos;ve been used by , monet prints from <unk> pictures .
we collected our materials , went from the room and waited half an hour .
i &apos;ll show you why .
they were added two pictures and had two beautiful <unk> , <unk> <unk> of them , and we said , &quot; which would you get them ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of <unk> <unk> and say , &quot; you know , we give a <unk> , and we can do it on two different ways .
<unk> that can fly the big car and the <unk> flies .
voices : it flies in the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that tradition isn &apos;t from the <unk> of <unk> , but continue back back into a time , even before we have stories on <unk> <unk> or <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the kind of triangular roof , you know .
and so we let my father his father because i knew he would kill me if i took them alone . so we go into the car .
&quot; and this guy had about blue uniform , and a <unk> expression in the face ? &quot;
i want to really do it ? because if i don &apos;t have a string of paper to get me to <unk> -- enough metaphors for your taste ? -- could it be that i never come back again .
see ? we &apos;re a secret club called a secret .
she says , &quot; ma , you must look . &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little old lady , damn even ! &quot;
she &apos;s gone out of the car . &quot;
i really &apos;m really afraid .
so what is the social outcome of it ?
where can i go and who together ?
and if we have it , we &apos;ll decide how many kilometers we drive , where we live in where we live and work .
intelligent terminal on the tunnel , and you see exactly where your bus is walking around and when it comes , and you can buy your tickets in time .
i want us to do the wireless arena , and i urge that this network should be using open standards for everyone .
and they came here in the late 1960 .
and for all of you who came with a mental illness , knowledge , what can be a challenge .
i said i wanted to tell the <unk> , i wanted to share with you the three a &apos;s fantastic and i wanted to leave you with a <unk> .
because they were all three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier just is a authentic person , and that &apos;s what authenticity is about authenticity .
i ate <unk> with <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in green sleep .
j there are so many that that &apos;s becoming a problem .
i found it strange about this as if it was a competition , a living in this new wound .
it &apos;s mostly a white , rich <unk> , which wasn &apos;t chasing the city .
it looks pretty easy , but this was a <unk> .
people were talking about two things -- they were amazed by the destruction , but there was also a feeling of the <unk> of the new yorker that i found very moving .
because if you look down the four platforms along the earth -- using a enhanced version of a <unk> -- knew that it had to be flexible , to respond to the circumstances and the changed definition of ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : i was an honor .
and i know that children suffer every year .
if -- heaven forbid -- somebody from us here , and a concussion , most of us would have a few hours to a few weeks of all of weeks .
they need to be aware of the issues that we talk about today .
it turns out , tom saw tom was a helmet for 20 dollars to maintain a 100,000 of <unk> .
that &apos;s not true , but it happened tony blair during the davos forum during 2005 , when his doodle , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; were discovered and described as it was described .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that happens in robotic field .
he was told him that there were no cure .
today , all countries are committed to provide patents for drugs that have at least 20 years .
it depends on the drug industry of pharmaceutical companies to make their patents available to others .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a <unk> , and people sitting sitting in the same air , the afternoon at high humidity , and they didn &apos;t feel .
they can adjust everything to your well-being .
he gives all these services , <unk> , tickets and so small things that you do online , but for people who connects it to the digital world .
the question was : &quot; how do you get from this teacher .
let &apos;s see what he does .
and the husband of daughter , he was also sick by the language of his wife .
but the visuals is still very big .
well , <unk> had a <unk> of our studies .
now if we feel emotion , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people are taking a different structural position inside the network .
this is my favorite . &quot;
they are both of carbon , and yet one of both <unk> in themselves , in a special way , on the left side , and they get woven that &apos;s soft and dark , which is soft and dark .
to do this , let me zoom up for a moment .
and then they &apos;re not easy .
in the same circumstances , older people are their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more positive information than negative information than on negative .
we &apos;re living life .
they &apos;d like to say , &quot; tonight i &apos;m going to do this <unk> for this girl on this bar . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so i &apos;m honest , often not quite knows what happens when i dance .
they &apos;ve called me brother and uncles and i &apos;ve invited me over five years over five years .
<unk> : the second paper of fort laramie warns guarantee is clearly the sovereignty of the major sioux nation and the <unk> of the lakota .
the treaty of fort laramie issued that at least three quarter of the <unk> sign sign to sign up for land .
they were tired of treaties .
the average price is eight times as high as the american average .
so what does us ?
and today ? child child child has declined since about 24 percent .
you get either you get either a pill or a syringe . you need to take it every day to regulate the test .
if we have this , like here , with people ...
but basically it makes a lot of sense .
it means : are they smarter than a ?
bmw is a very secure car .
the problem for bmw is , this car looks secure .
now they will think , &quot; if my life depends on it , i would use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect this with a scientific method .
this is something else to do an effective ad campaign .
what &apos;s nothing new .
lamps are becoming dark .
we do it for our customers .
we have we have the ones in the sun .
now , logic -- logic -- logic -- logic -- look at it sounds , you &apos;re now from this position to this one , without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to intervene now . if every time ... another person -- not always could be the same answers .
so if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some <unk> .
here ... i need to look at the beginning , so i can follow my cards during the computer conference -- oh , we should have done together -- no problem , no problem . no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : sorry ?
what card should i use ? the lady or five ?
lg : but you see your hand .
moment , wait , please please please .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yeah ? zoe : yeah .
here -- all maps covered -- here -- all maps put on -- is you ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly ... five seconds .
some of them seem to know this kid .
after i was back to a whole company , i did a <unk> . &quot;
if you couldn &apos;t have tone-deaf hearing , you couldn &apos;t move waste away .
let &apos;s see what happened here .
i always say my students : &quot; if you &apos;ve got a fallacy , you &apos;ll keep one eyebrow , then it recognizes everybody . &quot;
imagine the person , and follow you all the way after b and you will hear anything that chopin had said .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 years , had been an idea for 20 years , and suddenly suddenly a discovery .
she came out of auschwitz when she was 15 years old . her brother was eight , her parents lost her .
so , ladies and gentlemen from the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for tasks of the 21st-century century , this libertarian works , don &apos;t work -- often often don &apos;t work and often damage .
think about your own work .
living standard is lower .
these are the building blocks of a completely new business program for our business .
this one day of intense autonomy has led to a whole bunch of <unk> that might never have given .
make it because you like it .
this is actually using its easy weight .
in a series of 55 spheres , they declining , proportional , every single ball and their distances shrink up to this small earth .
and the blue side , the <unk> , shows in the other direction .
this has developed in many ways in many ways .
the object on the object would be probably a high <unk> picture of earth .
but it &apos;s always going to be 10 percent or more , which are most <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> dollars and a club for <unk> dollars .
charities need to resist themselves , courageous , big organizing landscapes , trying to try to try to find out that failure they &apos;re not pushed through the dirt .
so what should you do ?
overhead rose .
dan <unk> : our thinking about charity is <unk>
then there was the <unk> audience , yeah , who have been in the same way to music .
people who did these <unk> , the <unk> , all these beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about the execution of music as it is written , not to interpretation . &quot;
this is great . and what is with your eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .
you know , authority is available to you , if it &apos;s needed . this is very important .
so kleiber is about the process .
as a result , we tell ourselves many stories about the future and about how steps we could do from here .
there &apos;s 98 countries worldwide .
and faced with climate change , it isn &apos;t really a really easy .
and it &apos;s a process that really makes joy .
you think about whether they should drive it further .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we couldn &apos;t have transition , we would have to invent this entire community infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced . and to a certain degree is just the games that they play to hide this , that subject is so much so that you cannot recognize what they &apos;re really really obvious challenges .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that are not standing towards this big challenge .
and even if you &apos;re doing this , they could make money out there .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a <unk> when i visited <unk> <unk> , i was on a <unk> in my life and i tried to choose between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered watches said that sex lady i knew told that sex may be so good for the five senses .
it &apos;s very good sex in all five senses on an extreme level .
of course , five senses aren &apos;t the only thing life makes life .
we are all born as artists .
if you have a conversation , the child has to come up with the next answer to what it started .
but your parents say they say , &quot; it &apos;s shut away from the waves . &quot;
but children usually do art for fun . it &apos;s play .
but you rarely find a schoolteacher .
in fact , there are people who are &quot; <unk> &apos; s &quot; &quot; hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; las california &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; las california &quot; while they stupid .
right in this minute we can switch off the tv , and they put out on the internet , they &apos;re going to stand up and start doing something .
the students drop into a kind of trance .
he said it was his profile . &quot; and what are you ? &quot; i asked . &quot; i said . &quot;
let &apos;s start with how i came to this point .
it will give stronger storms and greater flooding .
if you , there &apos;s going to be warming in future .
but the delay is exactly the expectations .
the economic consequences are almost inconceivable .
a huge part of the species will be threatened by extinction .
now if a car accident happens , then it &apos;s critical that we don &apos;t just save stunt stunt , but the crew .
for something else , otherwise they &apos;ve been used to be used to be used for anything that you had .
but today we use a solar system .
more isn &apos;t it , a <unk> .
in 1960 , joseph <unk> from the united air force was something extremely incredible .
one of the trouble in this altitude , if you go down 10,000 feet -- that &apos;s great , or ? if you go to 10,000 , you can actually use oxygen .
they designed a puppet for him , exactly what he looked like .
we expect and others expect that maybe the faa or the <unk> will say , &quot; you need to put somebody into a suit that isn &apos;t tightly tightly connected to the airplane . &quot;
there were three <unk> -- not ? -- that are going through the conference , which matters to what i want to talk about .
and the girl replied , &quot; you know . &quot;
the problem is to stay in an artist while you grow up . i &apos;m convinced that we don &apos;t grow into creativity , but it &apos;s out of it . or we &apos;re actually going to be more inclusive .
anywhere in the world .
all the system was invented -- everywhere in the world there was no public education education education centuries ago .
the brain isn &apos;t split into areas .
they made ballet ballet , they did <unk> and jazz , they danced modern and contemporary dances .
this festival runs as well as a very good press for you would die .
let &apos;s say &quot; value for <unk> .
dubai is for me like a hand who wants to bring things all the things to do .
before i want to go back into the middle east , i want to close to a quote with a quote with one of the biggest <unk> .
it &apos;s also the <unk> .
well , beautiful . they &apos;re disorders of behavior , and they &apos;re disorders of the mind .
we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t even know what tools will be that or what we &apos;re looking at in all right to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to get the different behavior .
how are you zooming it ? &quot;
the three are all the same , although they &apos;re all in different context , one is magical , and one of these are like exercises i like doing these books because they have something very special .
kids were taught them .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that content is more important .
i was transformed by my children .
howard makes this experiment and when he gets the data , he paints a curve , and suddenly he recognizes that no nice thing makes it makes a beautiful thing .
this was his favorite book . he was obsessed with it .
howard doesn &apos;t believe that there &apos;s this .
and they always say people when you ask them how they wish your coffee .
a mustard with more elegance and culture and meaning .
so it was . and why did this like this ?
he was traded a few times and spent the bulk of his career in lower , and then ended up in management . he was got the general manager of &quot; oakland a &quot; .
we all know what happened when millions of women got for the symptoms of the <unk> , until we were given for a huge study , promoted that national institutes of congress .
thank you .
but dad &apos;s creepy and he didn &apos;t want to do that .
but there &apos;s also a gray zone in between .
these are four really different ways to see the world . i named it .
what &apos;s interesting is when you &apos;re going to do it -- and -- and -- by the way -- this is from <unk> -- all the artifacts of modern comics : <unk> <unk> simple line with no <unk> and a <unk> of links without a <unk> .
and that was what i proposed : we might make comics on an infinite canvas : on the <unk> and the players and in <unk> .
this is by daniel <unk> <unk> in britain .
maybe you &apos;ve got all this long , but for me , so often i came up with this hard problem every day , i had never seen this the <unk> of the <unk> challenge .
this is honest and honest , and why , what &apos;s representation is such an sustainable impression .
if you think your baby is gay or rebel , you should be thrown away for adoption .
<unk> political solution was , the citizen of texas , for rain .
this song called &quot; <unk> <unk> the sun . &quot;
i want to start something different today , because i want you to urge you to go on land and jump into open ocean .
they showed up soon after the dinosaur disappear , 65 million years ago , when whales had legs , they were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they allow me to do this <unk> .
and how do you create this ?
the <unk> <unk> takes the molas when they come into the bay , they pull them into a kind of <unk> , and then put them around .
i &apos;ll show you our last data .
and most exciting , all of their love and their interest for the oceans .
as you see here , this is a <unk> <unk> .
you don &apos;t hear something like this every day .
<unk> <unk> .
in australia , they are mostly the aboriginal people who sit in prison .
she told him and he was going to put the first <unk> to what we call the <unk> .
because nobody &apos;s got a <unk> .
why don &apos;t we have something to do this problem in everyday life ?
goodbye : gandhi .
could i get my last soundtrack ?
never , that &apos;s impossible ! no , no , no ! this isn &apos;t possible . &quot;
you could solve the whole thing with the addition .
von neumann , a mathematician and a mathematician brought all together . then they needed a room to build them .
and the and copy worked first by <unk> .
&quot; ah ! &quot; finally , they found that it was a <unk> .
i know if i got beaten to me . &quot;
he made the machine running all night . if somebody remembered stephen wolfram reminds all of the time .
now we &apos;re going 50 years later -- it &apos;s kind of a force of force animation animation .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes i &apos;m talking about here , four americans who are still alive , die . because because of their diet .
this is a global problem .
<unk> city .
and he has the beats full of it . he &apos;s tired , his friends , his family and his community .
they want ... they want to control themselves .
you know that for long long , long time , it has remained understood for long long .
we don &apos;t teach our children .
and most kids get them .
okay , supermarkets .
if you can cook , you don &apos;t roll .
in america , many wonderful things are going on , if we just look back .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of hackers who &apos;s in the 2011 .
the network combines everything and will quickly communicate a lot of human activities .
interestingly , anonymous uses its most information information , but not for financial services .
he told me like he was 2004 and 2004 , 2004 , 2004 , he took 10,000 dollars from the happiest machines here , 30,000 dollars from the cash cash here by using <unk> credit cards .
he was born in a stable and respectful middle class family , his obsession with playing as teenagers was a teenager .
and most of them , except by script and <unk> , no real social skills in the outside world -- only on the network .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into detail , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all the marketplace , and what is driving the marketplace , especially -- number one is the big demographic .
we also found lots of examples of dead big boxes that are transformed throughout all kinds of social institutions , many schools , many churches , and lots of libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets to be poured through the mall in the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it has helped inspire that eight of 13 regional regional regional <unk> <unk> in <unk> plans , <unk> <unk> .
the bach was covered by the parking lot .
their citizens are different as typical <unk> , but they are less than cities .
&quot; his vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; she &apos;s a whole guy . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there , it started with a woman with a woman .
it &apos;s about gender that represents a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the kind of exists really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning that we have in a real meaning , our bodies , our bodies -- that this separation has created an division that also separates the limitations of the decision .
i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings because it &apos;s very fortunate with happiness together , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s about my school school professor , which is not much smaller than today today &apos;s hungary , and once from a future as independent country dreamed of a country .
well , maybe he was too naive because he was staying , after it was , after the end of the <unk> by the nazis and even after the <unk> and <unk> started in budapest .
and he received the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers who can find them and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;m going to ask them . &quot;
and so clearly it says , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all that beautiful .
&quot; ah ! &quot; said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went alone in the movie . &quot;
like said , he &apos;s too much .
and you can do it right .
you know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we take care of the most difficult time and order to go back to the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went with , during the soviet soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not more , they keep asking it long until you do .
what i want to try to do with -- i hope to illustrate some points .
and i want to point out in this presentation , 50 percent of america are under the ocean .
it &apos;s <unk> there because the photons can achieve the average depth of the ocean , which is a mile miles . the average rate is at 12 kilometers .
and so we went along the <unk> in an area next to the <unk> , and found the missing heat there .
so i started developing a new model of a <unk> , with a <unk> which replaced me , and i don &apos;t need to climb my vehicles .
we find the state of the <unk> .
and i looked at her yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would take a child without driver &apos;s control over my tax system .
in some parts of the world , such as south africa , education is difficult to be difficult .
when we saw the effect of the <unk> , andrew and i decided we had to zoom in to provide so many people as possible possible .
what was this special classes ?
the video will cut all of minutes and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of humanities that multiple people don &apos;t have this bad thing .
so in terms of certain courses you can ask questions that are most <unk> and how you can help students to fix them .
we even see the beginning of either through a personalized <unk> or through feedback feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe and about what my first thought was what my first thought was what infinity means when i was a kid .
and in our society , obviously , it &apos;s mainly about making the reality of others .
i &apos;ve got my doubt about the values of newton , like rationality , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a darwinian rational .
so you can understand my surprise when i was in &quot; new yorkers , &quot; alan greenspan , surrendered to the <unk> of <unk> , says , ayn rand was his mentor mentor .
i think you can make fun of those fun , they don &apos;t have that , right from that reason , i don &apos;t have jokes about kenneth <unk> and his charming <unk> .
i &apos;ve been really going to get these old times of the <unk> , i &apos;m saying to you .
he said i should be more respectful pay for him because it could take to be 18 years to get a really good job .
well ? yeah ? yeah ? i don &apos;t hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid that active person doesn &apos;t love us .
i thought about moshe <unk> thought about beauty that she talked yesterday , because she &apos;s called it in his book , that trickster is sometimes beauty .
george voices bush : what costs our security , and what the defense costs our freedom , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer was not an astronomer on the world -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there &apos;s planets outside our solar system .
many different ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly thinking that an experiment with a particle accelerator could fail and function a effect that was destroyed the world .
we need to have the same caution and we have to do with a <unk> .
we don &apos;t want to see that one .
what can we do in the ?
and now it comes the worst .
we use lots of money on it , make sure that we don &apos;t die in a death rate , but we &apos;re almost not going to do anything . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
this is very , very important because this is the system , the <unk> that had been on the planet , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight , and we just recently recently .
and this is what the system is going to put out of the south hemisphere in the southern hemisphere .
everybody who comes later , simply simply reaching the database , and can use information that &apos;s needed for everything that happened .
we are to ride on the wave , technological possibilities .
in an earthquake , large amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
and john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that makes our oceans to global interactive laboratory -- and it causes a <unk> of the depth of depth .
so i think optimism is really spreading architecture .
so again , radical against conservative .
the <unk> against the immediate ones . you know , too often you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , are always being unexpected .
but i &apos;m more not playing something entirely entirely , and even with mistakes , instead of doing the same time time again , so that it &apos;s hollowed out of its insignificance .
risks of spaces were never as much as they should be in a groundbreaking city .
there are the emotions of victims .
daniel libeskind builds on very big ideas . he &apos;s called 17 words that his vision of architecture is to basically -- raw , daring , <unk> , radical -- and inspiring for all bold creative quest .
it also has the lowest amount of pollen of all the cars .
draws it out of something like this , or will it just be few more <unk> ?
em : it &apos;s just to do . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , you buy this capital and put the water on the roof and then calculated the <unk> or <unk> a monthly mirror that is lower than the electricity bill .
we &apos;ve almost failed , but we &apos;ve got a whole problem in 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet jet .
how about anything in the world could be so innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you &apos;re blowing our livestock , and you see a cheetahs like he eating one of our goats , it &apos;s very nervous , and then go very nervous . then go back to him .
we suffer famine .
our tradition looks like this : in every single school system there &apos;s an sacred fire .
we were able to get with support of world wildlife fund , to help programs with the <unk> .
so also very important -- we invest money in enlightenment about aids and hiv .
<unk> -- again , a <unk> among many countries in the world -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
and we &apos;re hiding this price behind enormous .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> was passionate about the <unk> revolution for food .
<unk> , clams , oysters , oysters , <unk> , <unk> -- these were known species .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
science is seeing the world through understanding , quantitatively , quantitatively , some of the things that can be described and described , but there &apos;s art for knowledge and discovery .
from the plan of a cameras from a plan of cameras , three weeks of 25 weeks .
this is natural circulation .
this wouldn &apos;t normally be a photographer , a photographer , a photograph of it , right ? but sometimes it must be to show the dimensions .
here you see the glacier back back to the glacier .
this has several cameras here .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just like it has become a global center for the <unk> and <unk> ?
if we were talking to the people in these online , they were working on , they said , &quot; we work on global products . &quot;
they can &apos;t be a professor , if they weren &apos;t a student .
the best hospitals , the doctors would go to drug therapies , and on births , <unk> , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial <unk> , <unk> around 4 a.m.
it works a bit like -- this is a recently <unk> for four o &apos;clock in morning .
i said , i realize a secret message when i see one .
each one in our society comes with cancer -- if not personal , then through a beloved person , one member member , a family member , a friend .
in this particular , the genetic material , the chromosome , within a nucleus .
we used tumor fields in the lab for 20 different types of cancer cells , and we see this effect in all of them .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in six month of cancer responded and it starts to be <unk> .
this is just the beginning .
this is a new workplace , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe and it &apos;s a little pipe and your courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles away , soon it looks like this .
somewhere somewhere goes down or a stream of a <unk> by this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> &quot; . in english , we have <unk> and water .
and they need to drop out .
these are the beautiful stairs we just saw on one of the pictures .
and they &apos;re 27 percent down , 600,000 less people per year , hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they are getting the jobs in textiles that are taking people out of the <unk> and get them down towards industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries on the right , you see the <unk> , basically every country has a <unk> of a <unk> , say , less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of say three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and 70s , india wasn &apos;t growing that right .
buy african products .
but i think there &apos;s a much bigger problem in this that this logic -- that we should erase ipods and not bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas <unk> new book .
so 500 people would have been twice , and four of them were selected to visit this facility and visit them to go to it to talk about it .
so now , citizens with people by planning not necessarily change anything about it , because it &apos;s still the dictators , which is the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : fulfilled the internet of worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he sat around us more boys around us .
because for me , who was in this time , and in this time , the question was said : &quot; do you want to do ? &quot; either sex or drugs -- and drugs we didn &apos;t have .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indians , and also politicians and <unk> , i &apos;m quite about the <unk> that affects our country , concerned , all the talk about india as new media company , indeed , even the new superpower .
in other words , all kinds of stories about countries , whether they want to get to the negotiations , not .
but there &apos;s a little bit of light in our country at the time , it took about half an hour to say it was a call .
she cannot understand the dialogues .
this can sometimes unwanted consequences . ok .
and these of you who have your money here , may be surprised to see how many <unk> of the <unk> are available on the <unk> that are going on .
i went home and researching a little bit . i found some frightening statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression comes from a critic , a early critic , and this is one passage i just love , and i would like to read them .
and this is a good thing because if it was like this , mother nature has a problem : how about all the chimpanzees get us out of the chimpanzees ?
this is the hardest part , which isn &apos;t obvious , and therefore i &apos;ve got it up for the end .
okay ? stop . this is now .
i don &apos;t know why there &apos;s been <unk> , but anyway , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you . thank you .
i actually guess the most likely , the most important reasons are probably aware of why we want to get new things very , very quickly .
it &apos;s what they look like . you should see something like this .
bob mckim has another one -- another version of this exercise in a fairly famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned this time , you get a much better brainstorming , much more creative results , if everybody &apos;s holding on the rules .
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design around a very peculiar object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back on it .
you know how it feels like all of these insecurity , as long as you go back into the corridor , whereas doctors care in one of the <unk> in one of the <unk> in one of the <unk> , and you ask what &apos;s going on here .
so we would all feel secure and we would feel secure and had a good time because we agree about the rules and agreed with it .
we do everything that leads success , but then if we &apos;ve got there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re just going to hear all of what we did . we just listen to all that &apos;s what we did .
i was faster , but as depressed .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the <unk> is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote : &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , forever , forever , the last time in public .
he made sure that everything together .
it took 900 people in this .
and the second is that people apparently learned a relationship .
these are questions .
as you see in today liberal democracies , the society is allowed us to determine our self , to determine our self , but it &apos;s also going to be from us .
it means that we meet our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers , the kinds of questions that i wanted to conduct today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to application if you design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian did let us that there must be better methods .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give one last fall .
he &apos;s put them into the right position , <unk> her nose and tolls .
we learned the first surprise .
there had had to be some kind of <unk> to make the amount of force and the speed that we observe and the the <unk> of the system .
a load cell data , and this is actually a mild load cell cell with a crystal inside .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the heel , and this is going to be <unk> and hitting the load cell .
a very , very basic solution for this particular problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the beautiful classical things that ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , not even more knowledgeable , which benefit that this is a three-dimensional space .
now look at this -- he &apos;s just standing me .
the submersible that was out last year , this one .
so , <unk> is understanding architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , -- please , i &apos;m sorry about the obvious idea of it -- isn &apos;t the right approach we need to vote .
basically new york has been built on the back of the <unk> , our streets about their shells .
in these eight <unk> chambers , little <unk> , which are practically <unk> .
so you walked around london and was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
finally , snow constructed a map of the iceberg .
and this happens every second week .
i did her portrait on the top of the <unk> temple .
and in this area of the amazon , 1972 oil was discovered .
the other side of the area is brought to translate , where actually osama osama bin laden is supposed to stop osama bin laden .
this was one of the big <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me continue to show you the hubble <unk> field .
but then you get jupiter and that &apos;s 40 minutes far away . this is a problem .
this is going to be part where it &apos;s about understanding the beginning of the universe .
we have only one million galaxies .
so this stuff that seems to be aware of this painting , dark matter .
when you &apos;ve seen this image for the first time , they don &apos;t have a lot of it .
this simulation was done with 1,000 processors for a month , just to make this visible .
and we &apos;re hoping to change a resolution that is about this image of earth that you actually can see the complicated patterns of earth .
and then we &apos;re going to stress .
forty-seven percent .
this is crazy . we &apos;re all all all all all all all time , even in everyday life .
i got into a vicious cycle , which led to lots of pain and issues with the joints , so i could almost keep anything more .
i asked me , could you be creative , if you &apos;re looking for the limitations ?
all this happened not happening today .
this is ongoing with <unk> is duty to be a <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
stalin &apos;s famine was the 30s , the <unk> , killed million <unk> , and in the 40s they looked at the nazis , the <unk> , killed , rape , rape . many of women were trafficked after germany .
it &apos;s the grief around . &quot;
and as a senior school , i got excited about the idea that we &apos;ve learned about what we &apos;ve learned in the virtual world and we could use our identity , to live better life in real world .
we get given ourselves to a new way of being alone .
human relationships are obese , chaotic and <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> them .
because in the moment , in people alone , even for a few seconds , they are going to be <unk> , scared , they &apos;re going to get them for an electronic device .
but we &apos;re in trouble because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently we didn &apos;t have any of the <unk> that some of our graduate students were predicted , and quite often -- quite often , i felt that they had been able to make their predictions in financial resources .
maybe because my father was reading to me .
so i made them quiet -- but right , and it had to be it .
i decided i thought a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing this kind of time to go closer to this .
although you lose not afraid of failure , if we &apos;ve given anything that we have given to you , because who can give you more desire to give anything that he can do .
if i should call names called names , i never know an answer .
did i have enough ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today in many clinical clinical trial are used for heart disease .
just last month , it has been allowed us to have this technology to show human rights collection .
we can map them map and then map 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all their <unk> features , then we can just take this information and print it by print .
i couldn &apos;t regularly go to school . i &apos;m just dirty .
i was a kid , i said like &quot; yeah , i want to do . i want this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new field developed called the <unk> .
and connected with this <unk> , there were examples around the world -- from choice one president to the <unk> wikipedia and everything between them -- they showed what the force could achieve .
third , <unk> , <unk> issues .
because what they need , that &apos;s the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want cd , i want the music that &apos;s playing .
i hot joseph and i &apos;m a member of kenya .
we need to run our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
late night night i went home with batteries and ice .
together : did somebody have a ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , give the master &apos;s master &apos;s master &apos;s master &apos;s job and working on this .
this can be enormous spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y , the <unk> of the <unk> work of the city &apos;s work .
they have <unk> , tables and data .
so these are , in the 18 minutes that were allowed to be here , to talk about here , between two and most vulnerable people who are going to be traveling into cities .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> , you &apos;ve got political activities , you &apos;ve got political activities .
i couldn &apos;t realize that i would be part of a technological revolution that would make this dream true .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same ones as i went through their committed support , willing to get meaningful qualifications in law rights .
meanwhile , they were mostly working with a <unk> company , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , he could develop a machine that could read any <unk> .
but you know , i find it very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books over the border , in the different english countries , different versions of <unk> : britain , united states , united states , australia , australia , and new zealand had had all different <unk> of harry potter .
the <unk> . lifespan has been more than doubled more than doubled and it &apos;s increasing with an speed of five hours per day .
another thing one last thing . wish you guys like me , okay ?
secondly , the new age of a good message , because once the androids work , we don &apos;t need to do this anymore , and this doesn &apos;t need to make us more more and more than saving us and <unk> .
the societal challenges because of these inequality should be addressed .
the economic playbook is surprising to surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , especially in short term .
and my greatest concern is that we create a world with incremental technologies , embedded in a slightly more inclusive society and supported by economics that promote inequality .
over the course of years , i started to feel more inclusive with this notion of god .
some of them have <unk> , we can only believe in a god that divides our pain .
in the second stage , the line comes &quot; wind and ripples obey it . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big or <unk> ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking inside the god , by my own personal <unk> .
one of the first things i started researching was the history of the <unk> technology .
we &apos;ve been found out of <unk> that were older as 40 years , and the average age of this hunters is 20 to 30 to 30 .
our bodies has used to these new diet .
so this equality of energy and matter , which einstein showed and also the modern science of the <unk> , that shows the entropy and information and information and energy all together , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to plug your own plug to get more electricity .
and what i mean by this is that we &apos;re looking for a new job .
a great development that began billions of years ago , moving through us and continues , and our choice is in technology , actually , is true to us with this force that is far more powerful than us .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five to 40 students .
we push it down all and found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bar , and it looked like this -- while we said , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we were sitting on the tables and waited .
there are lots of <unk> . the only problem , specifically for adults who had nothing really knew when they had started that there was only a toilet .
the teachers who we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they say what we should do .
about 170 tutors worked with them and worked with this wonderful thing that has worked beautifully .
and right behind -- there &apos;s usually a small chain -- right behind them saw them like children .
there &apos;s also these <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re going into the jungle , but it opens up slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s taking his cousins .
he writes an email , he will ask you every question you can do .
i was this girl .
80 percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one page that thinks that peace means the end of fighting , and there &apos;s one page that thinks that peace means that peace means creating schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one that means &quot; manual &quot; &quot; &quot;
on cape africa there are <unk> roads , and we &apos;re all able to drive .
this is my baby . thank you very much .
he said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i always felt bad .
so i came up this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos are very good .
college is most difficult , so number 10 has difficult --
everything in a strange <unk> of <unk> , which is about a window to the moment that the street was written in front of my house , and these white <unk> had been there in the sun .
and i was reminded by the brilliant presentation director director armstrong reminds me that religion really understood nothing with faith , but with behavior .
the <unk> has seen , geographically , the same size , it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it has exactly the same size as the united states , <unk> one area that is about equal size of the state .
but it &apos;s not only countries .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> , the australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of all of our entire civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we have through the presumption of this challenge .
before i show you some pictures of motts , i want to show you a nice detail about <unk> and design .
rca &apos;s really an extraordinary school .
we &apos;ve talked about this morning with keith schacht , many scientists tend to be able to show something beautiful in their talks , fear of fear as stupid <unk> .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here is that you can print textiles in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that &apos;s what makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little sharper .
we did this same for iraq .
this was a challenge of we had to ask us as physicist .
we can press it up . the forces are more . there are more of them , but they are eggs .
&quot; <unk> seven &quot; <unk> a whole ligament .
and there are some employees in foundations that call this <unk> .
the idea of justice that showed our lives limits and gives us a sense of what right in life is what we should do , social justice .
and like this , he &apos;s a <unk> .
so every week would come across the <unk> . &quot; god , you &apos;ve heard me heard about it . &quot;
they are a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection or an operation .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- <unk> like this .
we &apos;re treating them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- who , frankly , in this kind of pain , not very effective .
now they get a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was 1908 . no matter . i can live .
i don &apos;t know whether you can see him from the back line from all . these are only stars .
by 2005 , nasa launched a probe called deep impact , which is one -- which is a part of a bit of a comet <unk> .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we can have a <unk> and vote , and we can change our future .
i &apos;ve led to this time , the only independent to be exactly exactly the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that <unk> survive and be a great company if they had just gone away , what asked as right .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , you won &apos;t work , you will never see your money again , but my foundation is going to put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test this idea .
and we said that -- this is fine , we meet your business plan , what they actually did .
see , we &apos;ve started in east and <unk> with our work , and they went to russia .
we opened up for some time .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea of spending bonds bonds , bonds on the free press .
and in this way you &apos;re trying to finance , so that there don &apos;t be a blind , no blind , there are no blind to find themselves .
so why does this work ? this is the question .
well , some of these are called a theory of everything .
just one example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which works like 1 split by the square of the square of the <unk> .
the more symmetry has been , the better you put the simplicity and elegance of the theory .
one thing that he thought about today is as given us today , but at his time , it wasn &apos;t granted .
it doesn &apos;t affect the meaning of these meetings that they follow the laws of laws , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment he had , books .
by this ambition , he came back into the <unk> .
but when he was to put his signature under the <unk> , his hand was deaf and shaking , because he had his hands on a thousand hands during a night .
not surprisingly -- it was only three women under the white house .
but i need to say , as i became more , the more i understand , which was an incredible privilege that was obsessed with this aging lion was so many hours .
and as lincoln told the story , all after the war was after the u.k.
i asked my father underneath tears : &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
so what the reason why it is that i always appreciate this curious love of history that allows me to be able to live in retrospect .
he had the temples and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is evidence that the jews in babylon , after all the years that they sat in babylon in babylon , sitting in babylon in babylon , hoping that these jews were going to go home .
all these are respects by cyrus respects .
the <unk> cylinder is from the priests of the great <unk> of babylon , marduk .
you all know what happened then .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of living in iran came to tehran .
some people know more about living living , but they think they &apos;re a <unk> bad .
the new <unk> babies cried in the first few hours , but their needs not meet and eventually they couldn &apos;t get any longer in any time , within less days , they were <unk> , <unk> and start to the air , like everybody else .
one study shows that 10 percent of a cost costs , whereas 30 percent costs .
and i fascinated this because i almost had spent my whole life before a camera .
you know quickly what you &apos;ve got to do to find an answer .
it was more polite people -- most of them and family .
we heard each one .
but of course he never came . the explanation never happened .
and after many , many meetings i was excited that this man , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , it made making unicef into the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were those who believed in peace and all of its possibilities , etc . , etc . -- and they had actually going to be able to do it .
we connect us with <unk> -- i &apos;ve met a <unk> <unk> , i said &quot; at london &apos;s 2012 .
it &apos;s about your favorite school to do your business .
the greatest brains of the world should also be cognitively capable .
i &apos;ve been documenting the literature after the origin of this number , but i never couldn &apos;t find them .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , that fits exactly what our ancestors might invented a half years ago when they discovered cooking .
fairly simple approaches for the most useful conversations that i did .
and i think i &apos;m standing at the beginning .
but once the fighting has been concerned , the physical rehabilitation became exposed to physical rehabilitation .
behind him was a kid , his son , red in mind , in front of his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
i was talking about my bosses in the headquarters in headquarters , and i told them -- i &apos;m told you , &quot; look , we start with a few hours , just for some repairs . &quot;
two groups of <unk> started fighting .
so i asked him : &quot; what &apos;s it about ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the orthopedic center , but in the homes of people .
and you should see me during a <unk> .
and this hospital could have afford to be able to afford .
why ? because the path i had taken was forbidden .
but i learned something more inclusive than that , which is that the leader -- the managers of economics -- really bad decisions that had been given our economy briefly before the collapse .
because i knew that the state of african continent was important for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience i had at swarthmore to bring africa .
is my time gone ? ok .
we &apos;ve achieved a moment where a great society can rise up within one generation .
you will note that he &apos;s very similar to the yellow yellow ball -- the sun that we draw as children .
indeed , this is something that half of them , more than half , not being familiar .
32 pills are <unk> .
i guess . &quot;
and these are the messages they transferring them ?
because , in fact , the funders love it , and so they &apos;re constantly bringing them into television .
a professional <unk> who talks to dead , she didn &apos;t get me ?
what is <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to put proposals from you to ask them to be able to regulate , <unk> and municipal authorities so they &apos;re arguing something .
thank you .
so all of the hospital is just running over a generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but it can control if you &apos;re electricity , or not because you can control the motor levels on the basis of the basis of how much of oxygen you give .
but we want to be sure that this is the effective and best device that we can have hospitals available .
the different kinds of writing in africa , the first was <unk> , like writing <unk> , which is the <unk> of a secret society of the <unk> .
anyway , until 1998 , a <unk> named john <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , which were been in 1800 to 1900 bc , centuries ago .
almost one fifth of all greenhouse gases from livestock -- that &apos;s more than traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the animal cells and animals , and animals are based on the assembly line as tools , isn &apos;t just so fine .
<unk> was a unified issue .
a picture of <unk> would be better , or ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would think that may not be so bad .
i asked me a year ago , &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , no vegetarian ? &quot;
the weekends is choice .
you can make an image with an iphone and get all names , even though it makes a mistake .
it &apos;s distracted . he wins all the run .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would mean , it &apos;s interest to find more about it , when they are so high , but it &apos;s a very selfish area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big piece of art .
human nature had to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have a ethical level in effect of what we have in account is that they are inherently valuable .
it could be more complicated than people , but maybe not very .
jh : is it <unk> with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to control .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and engulf the individual slices , during the messenger in the hallway and we &apos;re going to go .
i was certainly 20 before i first went into an art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you want to pick your work .
it &apos;s not photoshop .
they interested in novel , alternative forms of information , and they needed money for this , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave and made this , it was hilarious -- the attention that we received .
and it describes how the <unk> -- everything she says is like this animal fruit .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of aboriginal people , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s related to origami . so go .
people deployed mathematical principles to the art underlying the underlying .
or they push it up on the top and do 50 stars with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules with you you get circles , you covered the <unk> with lines , the extra rules . that makes the crease pattern .
you can do lots of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you could need something origami .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether you go into space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a state of washington in the state of washington .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about hours about it .
and so i want to talk about this because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment i &apos;m going to show you a graphic , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before women start to get the job market , and it goes beyond today .
you gave instruction from top .
because i &apos;m talking about all this book , i &apos;m still going to have an answer .
and that was very disheartening for them .
since we haven &apos;t promoted this information yet , they come back to us in form of culture culture , in this weird and overblown , where you can see that stereotypical .
there &apos;s no man or no woman standing in the middle and it &apos;s to lids the cable .
whereas the personal income on a scale that was constant to consider inflation , in this time , more than doubled , almost nearly nearly .
and to hear me and understand what i say , you &apos;ve already have 60 bits per second .
and then it &apos;s happening , so in the last book of me called &quot; good business &quot; i interviewed some ceo who were very successful in their environment as very successful , with large social skills .
control is always a secure thing because you &apos;re probably feeling in your own , but not very smart .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning to what home is . they had their meaning for community , and even for hostility , which was given them from birth to birth , they didn &apos;t really have the ability to go beyond .
more and more people are also stuck in the future or present , as in the past .
i went down into the room i should sleep in .
<unk> <unk> : where is you home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and two billion in developing countries .
but this is the world that we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why i &apos;m going to show up to digital technology , digital technology .
the children survival is the new green .
and again they were better than we were , &quot; your brits and your death rate at heart disease is shocking . &quot;
but if you give people out there , you don &apos;t change the amount of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with <unk> , they were growing , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she &apos;s .
if you could be as well as well on the equator .
certainly many progress , many of these things .
this is even real photography , in time lapse , which shows that this limb is regenerated that limb .
and here you see on the right , you see what happened six months later , that &apos;s technically focused on .
a <unk> consists of two different cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell .
we then put it back into this oven-like device .
even more more complex organs , with far the complex solid organs are the highest solid organs that are high levels of organs that are their body loads like heart cells like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that are not reject and not tumors .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem there would have an idea out there .
so i &apos;m saying something in panic -- unlike all of the mba and sugar that i had -- but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur .
this doesn &apos;t mean that you have to visit a <unk> .
i went to door door to door and sold .
it &apos;s like a recession recession . so , there &apos;s a recession recession .
and you would make these chairs .
this is pointless . &quot; you need to find a path to get more faster .
i sold sold amounts of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the ability to find more tasks and learn , the ability of the fittest , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go into a restaurant and you &apos;re going to use bad , you &apos;ll show you how bad <unk> looks like .
these young , locust .
the development of today &apos;s students is to throw all the interests except .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of cultural <unk> , most of our students .
the values of the past are also <unk> . that creates lots of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a spirit . and they have other people .
what we should do when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- what &apos;s about is this : they go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and this doesn &apos;t only lead to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
actually , no one is not an organization , but clear -- let me finish this -- creative commons offers authors a simple way to vote up your content with the freedoms they want to leave you .
john mccain .
and i ask how often this happened .
he told me that he was the <unk> <unk> , and then said &quot; there &apos;s one line in the next room , and we &apos;re going to go out there . &quot;
so today i had this idea that i &apos;m going to show you through this process and show you what this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general electric electric were happy .
i survived , just so we understand ourselves .
i &apos;m always asked by people , &quot; is it possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another possibility of how microbes can spread through the people . architects used to use spaces similar to these human interactions to promote the human interaction or the exchange of ideas in for example , laboratories .
imagine a design , looking at microbes , for example , on airplane or on a telephone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the <unk> .
and greenpeace wanted to do this , and one method that you wanted to achieve that was that one of these humpback whales wanted to do a <unk> .
at 78 percent of voices . to give you an idea of the <unk> victory : rang 2 in the <unk> , only three percent .
and the last message i want to share with you is : you can be quite successful .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege is to stand in front of you today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something we &apos;ve got in gando are <unk> .
just like this .
good tomorrow . magic is a good way to be ahead of the <unk> ahead of today , to make this possible that science is going to be really going .
there are color red and color black , they stand for the enduring change of day .
voice : why not ? this is a very good sheet .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , an civilization-state , not as much as a nation .
but you can &apos;t lead a country like china , in the basis of &quot; an civilization , a system .
and the reason for this is , first , the state in china is a very special -- enjoy a very special value than the representative , the embodiment and the <unk> of chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was 25,000 miles long , beijing with <unk> and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the <unk> -- which is the position of the <unk> <unk> -- or the <unk> .
it goes down on a street in the suburb , and cars drive underneath .
red = drums blue = green = emitting purple = emitting purple = from ...
and the first song was english , the second was to chinese .
she agreed to her song .
i made graffiti , i wrote my name everywhere , used the city as canvas .
i mean , these were my friends of my friends .
they all agree that your painting would be that you would put on another one .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re going to do a <unk> face -- that &apos;s going to be a face , right here ? &quot;
most places i went to go , i decided i heard about her in the media .
i took more photographs , and we launched this project .
are you an ngo ? are you about media ? &quot;
so the roofs were row , <unk> a woman : &quot; now god can see me . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind every photograph .
but they &apos;ve basically declined a promise .
or &quot; how can we help . &quot;
if i think about the mesh and about what they &apos;re powering why it &apos;s happening now , i think there are some factors i want to give you as a ted club .
they &apos;ve triggered an trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , year 2000 .
it challenges for participation . cities have been very inclusive of participation in participation .
it &apos;s very inexpensive , and it &apos;s very selfish .
the last 40 years were remarkable times .
and also miniaturization .
this would require a vast hadron collider .
it &apos;s vital that this at ted &apos;s ideas , ideas that we think about , are focused on and make sure that this is an especially true century and not one of the <unk> and not one of the <unk> and <unk> .
my friends family are boring academics who are concerned about taking away from the <unk> for our research .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he would be crazy , but something really stuck .
i sat there , like you here , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since then she was my career since she did it , i &apos;ve brought me a lot of success .
i started exploring the <unk> <unk> of human psychology .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s very honored to be here at ted 2006 , in ted 2006 , in fact , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you would fall down .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have problem . you have the problem , you remember ?
sw : big prime .
sw : what is with a concert club ?
my parents found this important for their inner .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s something apart to take some apart from that i have <unk> .
the body has higher density than the water , at least 95 percent of the body appears from themselves .
and this is going to bring them very far .
i asked him what that means .
so , you can see , if you want to get different languages , and they take out without they affect each other .
and she looked up too high and said , &quot; well , i &apos;m better . &quot;
i think they agree to me that they &apos;re very good at all .
and so far tests tests have done with 50,000 students , so they built a half dozen schools , my readers , by the way .
we found out -- and we were wrong with quite many things , and then they did -- but we found that the young people loved it .
<unk> <unk> : a little introduction in the <unk>
and ultimately , the only person , the final person , a young shepherd , and he goes to saul , and says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there are the cavalry , men on horses and horses .
goliath is mild prey . he has no opportunity .
so goliath is much greater than the length of time , and normally there &apos;s an explanation for that if somebody is so far outside the norm .
and i think that &apos;s a very important lesson for us .
and it turns out that we are covered by a <unk> , and these microbes are doing most of us even better than killing us .
they &apos;ve got all microbes out and they put the ileum in the recipient .
most pills , or the <unk> that you can eat , one or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species .
we need a drug system for the microbes that live in and on people , so we can understand what they do our lives .
lots of people think about the internet is very on english , but for us , it &apos;s truly global . we have in many , many languages .
when you saw an interesting change on me before you saw me , they thought that all was just going on in nonsense .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk much about truth and objectivity .
and we &apos;ve got 40 <unk> , 40 <unk> .
it &apos;s not perfect rule , but it &apos;s enough for the beginning .
and i always like to say that she &apos;s also the only person that actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , that &apos;s why ...
it seems like most textbooks that are used to work in education of our children from nature inherently .
in the jungle in guatemala , in <unk> , it &apos;s a temples .
an innocent indian indian indian introduced an missionary in the year , and here &apos;s this : this is :
it &apos;s far under your cognitive counterparts .
we found activity also in other ways -- in <unk> , which is a computation of profit and loss .
i have a girlfriend who was just a terrible thing .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we turn together , and we keep our glances and we &apos;re talking .
tools like saw , knives , knives or <unk> i had wrapped in one towel .
i had looked for long and wide , but never looked at .
in some of these days , they put tools , like sponge to the <unk> .
so dolphins can be <unk> and out of remoteness .
look like you &apos;re looking at your mate and other <unk> .
but we found out that free dolphins don &apos;t just depend on a boat on a keyboard .
this dolphin we called &quot; <unk> &quot; because she &apos;s about 12 <unk> <unk> .
but while we decode their natural sounds , we &apos;re also going to get this back into the system system .
and the word is invented .
there &apos;s yves rossy .
and especially if you &apos;re in the <unk> , you have a feeling .
yr : i &apos;m just trying to be physically stimulated .
i &apos;ve used 20 times over last 15 years -- never with this kind of wing , but at the beginning .
we don &apos;t tell your employers .
but it was to <unk> and full of <unk> .
wondering wondering , as well as what they saw , they would be invisible powers .
because this event was the scientific revolution since our knowledge of our knowledge from the physical world , and how we can adapt our needs to our needs , in the end of the way that we grow .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do this ?
it &apos;s based on guesses ; our behalf of the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a story of a story .
and only if one explanation is good , it &apos;s also important to check it .
glasses aren &apos;t very expensive . they are quite abundant .
it &apos;s currently using 30,000 of them .
what is minto for a place ?
the new festival challenges the audience to play a critical role in architecture of the performance .
she had met with others to look at &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant &quot; and it has done all done well . &quot;
&quot; no <unk> , that &apos;s good . first doctor : &quot; are dizzy ? &quot;
i thought my career was over .
this is a bear , which i sat at a while on rock .
this is a piece of ice ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you pictures of <unk> , <unk> and polar bears and leopard seals , but this image here means more than any others i ever did .
people said saying , &quot; we knew that they were malignant . we knew it . &quot;
and this seal took the penguin and shaking it and forth .
she swam away , i started a penguin .
she tried to do my camera , what &apos;s the dream of each photographer .
paul <unk> : stories from a <unk> <unk>
now open your eyes right now .
do you have a ring ?
they &apos;re going to focus on this job .
joe , we &apos;re doing this for this long until she &apos;s kidding .
funny , yeah , we &apos;ve got a little man , a <unk> , working up all day up there .
as i said , you shape your reality .
first of all , we worked together to build ushahidi and developing ushahidi .
one call in america , to canada or china costs five <unk> , or 2,000 u.s. dollars .
it &apos;s built up , so you can also join a <unk> , and it &apos;s connected to another place .
and over time , the buildings were more and greater our technology , so that mechanical systems were enormous . they need enormous amounts of energy .
imagine two americans , two americans around italy .
please please please all of themselves as liberals .
the best definition of &apos; s i know -- it tells you so much -- comes from <unk> named marcus writer .
he &apos;s very , very old <unk> .
but look at the other three lines .
aren &apos;t that just the foundation of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
they went vertically upwards and always on .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws from my body . &quot;
and we have the sign of <unk> on the right , <unk> is the liberal god -- and both work together .
and so the answer , my thought , is to use this passionate commitment to truth and try to turn them into a better future for us .
but if you react , there are lots of other people in the environment that are innocent , but also could be hurt -- the military wouldn &apos;t want to talk about <unk> .
we look at something else , &quot; and couldn &apos;t seem to be really effective .
if somebody is an commandment , how often if you consider how they were introduced , how often the police spray in queensland veterans ?
there were only some people who were shot at this incident .
she &apos;s 72 and it looks like this is the most uplifting way to deal with it .
and if you &apos;re wired to use them , people are going to give them out , but they should not cause any damage damage . &quot;
we &apos;ve begun makers , maker power .
<unk> , or billy bass bass , or something like this .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he was also moving here to other people who did the same as he did .
this is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we need to bring this into schools , or in the municipalities , many species -- the ability to tinkering the world around us and new shapes .
there &apos;s glamour physics .
and indeed , we see these pictures of stars all the time -- you called them <unk> .
they don &apos;t look about a path , but you must be mentally aware of your world .
stairs , which is a <unk> twist , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s always going to tell you that illusion that if you buy this lamp , you get in a world without wires .
the perfect <unk> -- symbolizes by the perfect chain , with the perfect .
because glamour can be very egalitarian and deceptively .
but i also knew how hard they worked all week .
i did this before many strangers .
i heard about women who were harassed in their beds , or <unk> in their <unk> , like dead left behind lots of pollen , with acid burned off their kitchens .
then i got cancer -- or i found that i had cancer .
my girlfriend did this big bowl , and i asked them , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
it was friends for me , and a loving sister .
because we &apos;re all so bad to imagine the inner experience of our fellow human beings and their secret intentions . &quot;
children need a long time to do this system .
rs : <unk> . -- joshua goes to get some to drink .
rs : should ivan get trouble ?
and you get it into your girlfriend .
first of all i &apos;m going to prove to you that it &apos;s a <unk> .
please say me that they don &apos;t get away , if we say , the pentagon calls it .
but why does you feel something ?
and it was , you know , you know , a course for <unk> .
and secondly , is it possible , or even more , even more than even ?
they want to go back to a slow rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under the six <unk> nations in the world and working hours where average americans would cry english .
but the new idea , the revolutionary idea of the <unk> is that it &apos;s also something like &quot; good slow . &quot;
i &apos;m seeing that the <unk> of a <unk> job on my favorite school , i was going to get me to me because they were so slow and i wanted to finish .
and so all of his start , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build anything on an island ; part of it has to be on shore , because we don &apos;t want to avert us from the community . &quot;
i worked months of this , and i couldn &apos;t do it because i felt that people who came from the historical museum already already with information full of power , and if you can &apos;t change a museum with information , they would not able to digest it .
when i walked back home , the <unk> was planned .
but you recognizes the uniqueness of the environment .
moshe safdie : building
and when christian played a note -- play a game for example .
so in jazz , the <unk> is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about my vision , or something .
am i ? exist i exist ?
they had to get a lot of time to come here .
summer is expanding in summer , india is extremely hot .
and the adult animal that comes from , still live one or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i know today . these are hundreds of <unk> .
this was a bit curious , i hear here , because i want to ask you , and here &apos;s a lot of people who have been doing -- from india , of course , people who spent their childhood here .
so next i was going to put me on phone .
october , november , december . that &apos;s not the time of the rainy monsoon .
okay , you put your eggs at the time of the rain time , during the <unk> .
just last week , it has <unk> . the <unk> has begun and now rain there .
a fairly incredible evolutionary system .
incredible . this is the <unk> migration of a <unk> . it &apos;s quite incredible migrations .
i did this from my life .
and everybody thought i was good . but on the new terrain i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what happened with <unk> ? &quot;
i looked at them during night before my surgery , and i asked me , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;
next -- oh , pay attention . these guys here are the community .
so i was quite successful . and if you &apos;ve achieved all this , what is it going to happen to that ? i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> and other things , but what causes one ?
my last tedtalk , about seven years ago , about seven years ago .
but carl norden has actually cracked the code .
whenever the norden bombsight was brought into an airplane , it &apos;s accompanied by a series of <unk> monsters .
the chemical plant is on three square miles .
after the war was over , there was a review -- like it the army , the air force always does -- and they asked the question : how many of these dinosaurs did we actually collapse ?
i described to you the opposite of a story .
a walk in a city or a walk like this journey shows this diversity of human species in an amazing way .
we ask questions about human ancestry .
but what data is that constellations ?
imagine that you have to do it .
it was an african that &apos;s based on the world &apos;s world &apos;s diversity of <unk> .
the sahara was much bigger than today .
the people who are killing on the animals they hunt them into the <unk> , moved to north and after about 45,000 years ago , the grassland in the middle east in a rare <unk> phase of sahara sahara desert .
the <unk> , <unk> on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe doesn &apos;t move from mush to complexity .
so there we go .
what you see here , the blue areas are about a thousandth of degrees cooler than the red areas .
it works smaller distances than gravity works , which explains why you and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
they &apos;re going to be familiar with the helix of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
maybe you ask yourself , &quot; what talks about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not as good if it &apos;s about insurance .
and then they need to decide how they invest in their 52 choices , and you &apos;ve never heard about a <unk> .
at least a wonderful study has predicted that .
but if you get the driver &apos;s driver , you cross the boxes if you don &apos;t want to donate your organs .
the other group gets two apples , one &apos;s taken from .
saving more tomorrow is just doing it .
this is just one example .
it &apos;s a song about a called <unk> , an creatures that imitating an creature that creates a creature .
hi , who &apos;s there , please ?
thank you .
and that &apos;s informed too much impact on the <unk> .
i &apos;m trying to get time to <unk> .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent her walter raleigh to separate her human part of her two two .
do you get a kid ?
elizabeth : ready ! shut you out ! ready !
i went visit a friend of mine and he took me waiting in his bedroom in the 20th floor in the 20th floor , a really very rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we lived from less than a dollar day -- for about 15 years .
and you have to use toys from the rainforests in the rainforests to show that forest as forest are more than a forest . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t get a person to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
if on a limited planet , should be sustainable , how can we get this ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
we had , i think 60 percent of the global production is at the table and 25 percent of the world &apos;s production .
this isn &apos;t irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t only buy the juice ; they buy the carbon in the trees , to offset the <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;re going to get to europe .
so the communication is interrupted between the brain and spinal cord ; this leads to a complete and sustained paralysis of the fittest .
after several years , we &apos;ve managed to develop a electrochemical <unk> that resulted the nervous system of the spinal cord in a waking meal .
we &apos;ve worked hard hard to accomplish this goal .
after a few weeks recovery , we put an programmable pump to inject a individual <unk> cells directly into spinal cord .
and i was a kid of class class .
he talked about the world about the world , like it &apos;s &quot; and the &quot; world as it should be . &quot;
and by doing this , these women were making lots of hurdles from the path .
the white house , and the desk sitting on he &apos;s called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the last day came out of all day , the woman who got care around all , and we talked about a few each other . suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing me anything ? &quot;
for this case , this is a <unk> response to the voice because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneously , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have them .
so the internet needs <unk> and orders .
one of the most favorite websites in the world that &apos;s powered by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that youtube or google could have done on .
and today wikipedia is so clear that you can even find them on the maps of restaurants in china .
and this has understood wikipedia .
this is a blog that &apos;s got a blog that &apos;s <unk> .
why ? there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> .
the world didn &apos;t ended in the 1990s .
and we see that the effect of the environment is very much very , very strong .
all this costs money .
and it was done much to give students with <unk> or socially weak families .
how are schools and teachers show ?
in bureaucratic literacy , teachers are left in class alone and have a lot of <unk> .
some people argue that the change of the <unk> is something like a <unk> .
but if you look at the issue from this perspective , you see what happened over the last 60 years .
and i was about 15 kilometers to get the <unk> .
so this was obviously a <unk> device .
we could do this with phones .
so a business emerges for them .
&quot; the government needs to provide economically profitable services . &quot;
it was , long ago , long ago , when i was 24 years old , i studied at st. john &apos;s medical college in bangalore .
and you can see my card when i &apos;m going to see it here .
and then i &apos;m teaching an invention .
now we are in the 1930s , and you see that japan is going through a period of war , with low lifespan .
and they decided not only to invest in health and education , but also started to grow economies grow .
washington , d.c. went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
will they actually accept a fully fully fully fully developed economy economy , and the power transition from where they were going back 50 to 100 years years back to asia ?
the rest of the graph is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that doesn &apos;t explain the existence of all the mass .
and you &apos;re paying attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of selfish model of what &apos;s going on during the <unk> .
they move apart because the space is bigger .
by looking at things like clusters of clusters -- their <unk> , how many of them are as function -- can we get in experience , that &apos;s where dark matter and dark energy are freely facing structures .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy banjo banjo from ... new jersey ... new jersey ?
so recycling and reusing are <unk> here .
marc <unk> : 1.3 million reasons to reinvent <unk>
and indeed , there were these change in gay men in america during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills lots of adults in africa , and lots of children .
in uganda we have that distribution .
this is very similar to close .
but openness and connection has a price when we think about disease , that should not be surprise .
coffee is <unk> .
emily <unk> explores the aids statistics in africa from an economic perspective and comes to a surprising implication : all our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i fascinated me because i watched this kind of <unk> italian <unk> .
he was called &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , called <unk> , called <unk> , because he was going back to a tunnel , and then he built a <unk> ball , and then he built a <unk> .
this bumps are on the water like a magnet .
then we ask us why the membrane is clogged and why it &apos;s going to need so much electricity .
for example , in the <unk> of <unk> in a material .
in <unk> , my favorite , i &apos;m working with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine benyus : biomimicry in action .
&quot; yeah , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately , not boys .
you can &apos;t do anything .
it will never happen in india because this was now and never again .
they said , &quot; yeah . &quot; i said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a <unk> for over 1,000 inmates in this prison .
secondly , it &apos;s about the most sophisticated movement in india .
let me tell you about one project that we did a few years later , a kind of engineering project .
basically , you &apos;re using it by an old book .
the number of sides are using recaptcha , actually , so high that the number of words that we digitize a day , very big .
some are more funny .
now , the web is divided into several languages .
then my favorite question comes .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a valve valve .
but what may even surprising is that we get from the <unk> , even if you are just primitive , the translation that we get to get as well as the professional engineering model , and that &apos;s very surprising .
there people are worth learning , they don &apos;t need to pay with money , pay attention to your time .
the connected side , the company , does what they really can do .
and <unk> in active participation is everything else as normal .
and zipcar offers a very appealing , <unk> service that works beautifully .
for aristotle was fortunate , the highest good thing to do to all other .
maybe these people are right . his thoughts , may not be good .
10 percent of the time , the thought ... ... sex .
i played the violent african , african terrorists .
now , from the first time of <unk> , no unique comedy emerged -- no one has achieved the absolute majority -- so the elections was gone in a second round three weeks later .
here &apos;s a more interesting comparison .
so i moved moved supersonic jolla and learned about surfing .
people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really understand how much as we did that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we &apos;re doing this from a certain reason and that .
and so , charles , i &apos;m going to provide money to give you a building , and you can meet you there , but you can &apos;t talk about religion there .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody was going to make a little bit that would make this happen .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i &apos;ve got something that &apos;s not personal .
if you want to become rich today , you will .
they say if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t go up -- it &apos;s not going on . we &apos;re actually going on for 20 years , very carefully from satellites , and they don &apos;t go up .
biochemist kary beats talks about the foundation of modern science : the experiment . he tells stories from the 17th century and from his own <unk> in the garden and <unk> curiosity , inspiration and care of good science in all their shapes .
i wanted to represent a simple kind of living body that are these <unk> , beating spaces .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; <unk> &quot; embodies the <unk> and <unk> that emerges from the feeling of the <unk> in an urban environment .
i love it , traveling , and berlin is one of my favorite books .
and all of the time i haven &apos;t seen a single rat for some of these places until recently when i was gone into the garden .
the first question is , and maybe you write them on either a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual sheet in your head , and , for audiences home , you can try this .
and we then break , &quot; we are the best <unk> school in the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- you &apos;re nodding -- now , in your dorm room , they thought , &quot; hmmm , what happens during night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is if people have an idea of how everything works works , it &apos;s fairly difficult to change that .
and as an expert on inorganic chemistry , i &apos;ve got friends and colleagues , which differ between the organic , living world and the world &apos;s environment , <unk> world .
and you can see , it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , grows in some sense .
we even have amazing forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself introduced a letter to a colleague of thinking that life probably has been done somewhere in a warm small pond -- perhaps not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this fabric of life ?
and we can connect them and literally thousands and thousands of really large-scale molecules , in same size as dna and proteins , but it &apos;s no carbon in the way .
we want them to put them into the environment , and we want to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and make matter to it , it &apos;s going to define life .
but there &apos;s another second reason why i love this <unk> : every single one is measuring .
and these are highly professional interviewer , who sat down an hour with a woman and ask them to ask them .
i was really sitting on my computer on friday , and i could see how the death rate was on the morning of the morning .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want more and more of them .
as you can see , that makes no sense to compute a average of a improvement that no was not and this very rapid progress .
but you don &apos;t speak that much .
they were high , or very high , child child and families were also very tall , six to eight .
there &apos;s also static .
whatever remains is worth money .
yeah , i went barefoot until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; hey , the <unk> problem .
all the time was a border .
and then , in my opinion , the world will get forward , not just for some few but for everyone .
... above the knee , yeah , that would be difficult ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 800 million dollars .
he said , &quot; earth is enough to meet everybody &apos;s needs , but not everybody &apos;s greed .
and they die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the council of scientific research research -- 40 laboratories -- if two don &apos;t speak two languages , i built teams .
they &apos;ve had on this , and now i &apos;ve got applications on the store .
it &apos;s about having something to perfect something to perfect and to a old way .
it &apos;s still very hot , but no longer .
but there isn &apos;t under high pressure , but they &apos;re not at high pressure , and they &apos;re not so reactive , which means that the don &apos;t tend to be the reactor pollution .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i designed here is a innovation that can be a great scientific source , the great scientific projects that &apos;s going to be electricity , and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we move us to a <unk> where the actual experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer of the <unk> distribution for the case that they run in the forest .
and at the end of a long <unk> good advice that he &apos;s his son , he says , &quot; well , it &apos;s <unk> against yourself , &quot;
normally in los angeles , you don &apos;t run a lot , but there &apos;s a place where you can run lots of running out in this city .
then they &apos;re going to feel wrong as a fake -- by making qualities that they don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very introvert and i was like to be just .
then it was just about starting to start to start and build them to the end .
so i built it out concrete , because it &apos;s really no matter .
this was this tool .
and for me , it &apos;s the most important thing , because i &apos;ve been a kid , i wanted to communicate my passion and love .
25 days : the <unk> developed over 32 days : arms and hands are evolving for 36 days : the primitive spine starts to train the period of time that the fetus has developed the fastest .
complexity , complexity , in one system , again , again , beyond any understanding or any other things today .
because apparently there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> <unk> not in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
recently , a colleague of berkley , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting spectrum and asked , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about <unk> and <unk> stars -- on the matter and chemical elements in the universe are produced and regenerate .
because can you imagine that everything is ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just standing up and say , &quot; so , we &apos;re going to be on . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see it , and oxygen , then i think we have the perfect e.t. right right ?
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely &quot; .
what i can tell you : it &apos;s universal ; we &apos;ve all got them .
i &apos;m slightly hooked on <unk> , but this is another talk .
this led to a small collapse -- which was actually more like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what gives you feel vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t right . stop .
we do it as what we do , no effects on other people .
people were eating their meals on twitter , the diapers of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , use systematic improvement , then we think about how they can be useful to our <unk> , for our our health care and self-knowledge .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at then , we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven shares his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this cochlear implant , also , the only ones that were online and available online .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have a backup system , you don &apos;t have data , it doesn &apos;t work for scientific methods .
this is the curve about the <unk> .
but my brother didn &apos;t get it to end .
if we went from here from here from here , we would find on something that goes 300 feet tall , 120 miles long , 28 miles wide , and this weighs two gigatons .
to change the state , you just need two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that is called the <unk> .
these are networks of objects , are more complex systems .
and it has also focused on systemic risk .
so we could put any <unk> in each other .
we see the emergence of <unk> and <unk> programs that focus on our communicating world from the point of complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity with <unk> -- except you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had ready 500 of these <unk> .
without human .
so we were on top of our <unk> .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain starts thinking very quickly , that this is a <unk> representation of the <unk> of <unk> in the world .
because this question predicts that our external world can predict our own changes , but the truth is that i only can predict 10 percent of the person &apos;s body of a person , if i assign their entire external world .
and this is for two reasons scientifically <unk> and wrong .
we &apos;re getting people to take your <unk> , to write a positive email of the <unk> or the <unk> of somebody in their social environment .
so hard to say -- a <unk> , you understand -- my dad was the smartest man in the world .
and so i moved . i went down , closed .
they said that it lasts .
they take a big gear from cardboard .
he was the first digital media company in tokyo .
do you hear that ? like cows ? this is in logan morning morning .
so there &apos;s all these things to do , but most of love i love to learn the world .
and i was experimenting with passion .
their culture doesn &apos;t come in schools . and i want to show you how we can overcome this problem .
so that makes you nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there &apos;s no boys .
and over small moments in my life .
or mothers who have brought up boys ?
we need to change the posture of schools in elementary schools .
and you have the impression that you think that would be okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going .
is this a problem ? yeah , a big problem .
we think that these &quot; why &quot; why &quot; why &quot; rules are possible to give us the basic principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and do this , i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and this was really an important lesson for me to do not really affect any object .
we &apos;ve created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s linked to my ipad , and this is software that runs on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> , i &apos;m going to put it up with a <unk> , so that people respond to a different way that people get on the side of them .
i &apos;m going to transform in a man of my talk , and then i &apos;m going to an old man .
they were allowed to be allowed .
radio : what do you think about it ?
fold your wings together and drive them .
so i ask you another question .
and he took a royal <unk> , with <unk> , who had instruction , day and night , but with the secret instruction , not very much to <unk> it .
because they found that <unk> means more deeply informed human behavior .
yet we have to create a very clear <unk> of where you can create this kind of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of fairer .
now if we &apos;ve got all these tools , we have to ask us the question -- and thaler and <unk> did this -- how we use these intelligent .
they lead the new ones .
it puts small , <unk> <unk> .
i felt passionate about passion , soul and heart , had left my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not without &quot; .
all around us , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , so a different replicator is finding out in this darwinian culture .
you probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than space for all .
we are the only ones and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
this was dangerous , but hi hi .
they use us to produce the resource of the planet to produce more and more computers , and more amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and then we &apos;re going to go through this third note how we &apos;ve gone from the second and first ?
working with <unk> -- this is the <unk> in haiti -- with the ministry of public health , with various projects , we inspected more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us more if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had an burn of 70 percent of my body , it took about an hour .
we also found that it was good , you would have given me behind the pain for me .
and how bad would the sentence would be if i would caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the smartest people -- the ones who have been <unk> , less cheated -- less cheated , and that less religious -- those who would never remember almost no commandments -- more cheated .
so if you don &apos;t think about a few seconds of money , because you get your brand , does this difference ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think all these forces are really bad impacts on the marketplace .
but you can believe me . i work in advertising .
these are the most knowledgeable ones i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon will be on the brand and competing with the <unk> , determines how you want to spend money , what makes money .
maybe this seems to be a big leap ?
i don &apos;t need to explain it , i &apos;ve got to explain it -- last week , i had to explain my nine-year-old -- skeletons are structures that transporting sperm from an individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the <unk> here , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissue by making them freely contract .
and this was because every hydrostatic skeleton we found in nature , had found the same strategy .
all i showed that was really surprising about it .
a funny song about global warming , from jill sobule .
well , i must have to do it .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; are the benefits of a great training .
the <unk> <unk> totally from above this , and ben became a <unk> .
keep it , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo where i was a <unk> .
but <unk> has the united nations united nations has estimated the wealth of the country over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they need to stand very inexpensive .
but couldn &apos;t not be done for this angle of <unk> ?
they demanded about the governments , they were informed , and they &apos;ve got them .
but suppose we &apos;re going to take our goal to bring new economic action on the ground of the pyramid .
because they would have had a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their returns .
he loved it on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to be in his bed .
since <unk> , as sir <unk> <unk> and the british society for the <unk> thought that the sun seems .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s something like this .
and this energy is that &apos;s going fusion .
about a traditional <unk> system .
we need to make it a power power .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country and it &apos;s also a huge impact .
and they would want to be most democracy , but they were all the population that would be in the last month in the last month , had stated an officer -- it was only four percent .
but the expectations of people are significantly significant .
so the question is going to say , &quot; what drives people &apos;s support for women &apos;s rights ? &quot;
i promise you has read the message .
no one can listen to you , they just send them a text .
you could see the immediate effects of laws or the <unk> talk on a <unk> , and see what happens as a consequence .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 feet over 35 feet .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> .
from the smallest of the <unk> of the subjective forces of nature .
we can afford to be able to get your minds in it .
we think somebody else , somebody else , somebody else , somebody with more devices will solve this problem .
we didn &apos;t get him into the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that really was flying .
and so there &apos;s this incredible amount of light that can be possible , and this huge amount of serious about what that means .
and think about our moral gods .
and the director was quite passionate , and told me that he was crazy for crazy , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are heavy offenders .
it took several such events until i found what i should do .
when i started this program four years ago , my <unk> plan was a <unk> of the <unk> plan .
and they look down to the <unk> , everything is tiny and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the guts to put my post my post my post at nyu , and return to my home country , where i could make these incredible rides with this group of everlasting children from ethiopia , morocco and russia .
and how often would my self have to die before i understand that it didn &apos;t exist from beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly , no , don &apos;t have my belief belief , this feeling of otherness .
this was because i had no self , which was between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have if we honor the inevitable death of ourselves , the privilege of life and happy what comes next .
and this is a cafe in the ocean in britain .
but instead of what we focused on what we &apos;re focused on .
we also discovered that like a structure of structure and a more nuanced way of getting through this structure .
but we found that seed -- this really important project , but that seed -- that seed -- in the leading botanical gardens are not going to find seed seeds .
we worked with a <unk> to develop a <unk> of the seed seed , so if you &apos;re visually impaired , so it was kind of <unk> and soft , that piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few stories you perceives , and the rest is just postcards .
this book called &quot; the blank sheet , &quot; popular idea because the human mind was a blank sheet and all its structure from its socialization , culture , education , civic and experience .
well , there &apos;s a bunch of political reasons that they like good .
it &apos;s still not clear whether this generalizations are appropriately appropriately appropriately , but then it seemed to support this .
another one of the <unk> and <unk> at universities , who are in more democratic ways in decline .
now , the other hot iron is parenting .
and i find , you can &apos;t say it better .
i also calls out , just like this , and they don &apos;t like it , but they confirm it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; one day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked me what would happen if we challenge some of these kinds of <unk> .
right ?
it &apos;s like this -- we &apos;ve got this war as a society , each of us .
your iphone without the people , the same containment , same circuits , same keyboard , over again and over again .
and then it became bigger and bigger and and now it &apos;s been more inclusive sides long .
and i said to brian : &quot; what did tony did ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you have fake here ? &quot;
but how do you do a mentally normal fashion ?
so all of things that came out on tony on the <unk> , evidence that he was going crazy to this new kind of crazy .
he came in <unk> in <unk> and 30 percent of the workforce , american cities simply transformed the cities in the <unk> .
and i added : &quot; i &apos;ve got a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the jewels are always the most accurate aspects of the personality .
anyway , this was two years ago , and this is where my book ended .
actually , the trend in the world &apos;s the world &apos;s the rest of the world .
and as a consequence of this battles battles it &apos;s been very , very difficult to say : i &apos;m going to be aware of islam . &quot;
it may be that one big war between east and west has been developed , and that it was necessary in terms of communism against communism .
and even though president has been , for example , very , very well , it has been very good enough to do with islam , but there &apos;s nevertheless , a natural pulse of <unk> the other side as enemy .
when the treasure fell in 2000 , you just saw the peak of the best <unk> that scientists ever had had had had had been a professional age -- who had been a certain kind of research .
day after we arrived two of us were two of us with the store of room , two of us , two of us have more than 4,000 penguins .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue .
and this is really important because african penguin was explained to an endangered kind of endangered species .
at the transcontinental row railway , on the <unk> , a <unk> , in the <unk> and even before the police department .
people are open for the <unk> .
we launched this campaign -- very fun -- called &quot; every egg matters . &quot;
this isn &apos;t a second grade .
these lessons came out of <unk> , abstract .
hillel turned on a leg and said , &quot; what you &apos;re doing is not your neighbor &apos;s don &apos;t do your neighbor . this is the <unk> . the rest are agnostic .
now , this is not the whole story .
and achilles takes <unk> <unk> and hands him carefully about his father , and the two men see each other and recognizes each other as divine .
this view of the cells actually looked at me in biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
every sand sand has a size of a millimeter .
you can see this <unk> .
this image was the beginning of the <unk> .
we &apos;re all looking at all the same from inside , believe me .
the walls are from 700 millimeters thick , solid concrete .
and this on the left is an x-ray .
it has human associations .
in x-ray we see all the little seed in the edges .
i had to put the car in the middle , and i had not really quite easy job .
yeah , you &apos;ve given 12 monkeys for a week , and after this week , they &apos;ve used it as toilet .
science is actually saying that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m going to get a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you very much .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we don &apos;t agree to all .
not professor and <unk> , only two minds , ready to get .
and then my life was all right .
everything i saw in manufacturing was that there was right <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
would then be time to process information ?
we &apos;ve spent lots of time to spend a billion dollar business -- they &apos;re going right — a billion <unk> <unk> , where it was involved , and what we found was shocking , but later later .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were stunned that these companies were quickly made their <unk> <unk> , and the most important in london , <unk> <unk> .
this is too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re all die . we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all sick . we &apos;re going to leave .
there are places that you can &apos;t go , thought you can &apos;t think , worlds that you can &apos;t inhabit longer .
they have a <unk> and a freedom of which i think is the foundation of a new <unk> .
she has made the decision to get no <unk> or <unk> , but their lives devoted to her life that this is not happening .
we are all refugees .
but you get me this thing on my head , and then it happens .
but they don &apos;t do this . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find this , but his employees were not going to ask him , and said , &quot; you go to rehabilitation club or you &apos;re going to go fired and die . &quot;
ahh ! we meet them , the <unk> loved . let &apos;s pull them out .
if it &apos;s on this box , which is the <unk> , then it &apos;s .
the characteristics that makes childish word childish are so often in adults that we should abolish this age of old word , if it comes to critique behavior that is associated with <unk> and <unk> .
if i get the ability of my sister &apos;s ability to pay 10 percent interest that i &apos;ve got on my last loan , i will make more money to get more money from me until she paid it back .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live more in the dark times .
and the third is all sounds that we create people , the <unk> .
this is after selective forestry .

if the magnet is big enough , and its resolution up enough , you can actually get all the proteins in your body and start to understand the individual system .
most of us find this reassuring , and interestingly , 12 cycles per minute is about the <unk> of a <unk> man .
so for example , if i put this here -- -- longer than a few seconds , they would feel uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and they would leave the hall .
they all recognized . and this is the melody that &apos;s the only thing to hear in the world .
and i was there with two very good friends of mine , richard weavers and kevin <unk> .
while we cross miles and miles of <unk> -- <unk> <unk> that could be <unk> .
like i stand here here and talk to you , i &apos;m about five years of about five years .
800 feet from the coast and mumbai feet .
the ocean determines climate and weather , they hold temperature and shapes the chemistry of the world .
there are easy ...
this is the result , if you don &apos;t know that there are limits on what we &apos;re going to take the ocean .
for example , the united states three years , america has a <unk> cubic cubic cubic cubic miles of ocean as protected .
we need <unk> , new technologies to explore the ocean .
i wanted to figure out a bulk of my early career , like the wings of the insects , to keep it in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of the visual skull of the lab from jeff &apos;s lab , and you can see the wonderful pictures of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re <unk> a <unk> to put any behavior , another <unk> has another <unk> and patterns and you can think that this works in an extremely complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and <unk> computer model of the human brain .
it &apos;s home and drinking tea .
if you see the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to get out of small components , and it &apos;s like a computer .
how many per prolific tree is ? where are they positioned ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , it activating , and watch what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the secrets of the brain can soon be solved . mental illness , memory , perceptions , perceptions : it &apos;s both neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s planning them with a supercomputer who &apos;s <unk> the brain with <unk> synapses .
it would need two or three thousand bombs .
the air force began to build smaller models , and started this .
this is what nasa did to get a solar system that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about more comfortable behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the lower ? yellow .
if you ask people that question , they usually think that it has something with culture .
the countries on the right , they &apos;re very much more , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but then get back back , it will be more complex .
a online investment online for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know our business behavior .
in fact , in medical medicine , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared -- you can use your eyes to change your eyes .
its intensity can become very quickly varies and it can become very quickly off .
they are critical critical .
but it &apos;s just by the way .
cars have <unk> and <unk> and can communicate each other and can communicate with the cars and communicate on .
dna is what &apos;s mean is universal .
because they &apos;re not so many data .
you have your genome , and it makes a customized medicine that &apos;s better than today -- it has no effects effects .
it &apos;s really easy -- has only been only <unk> genes -- but we could fully synthesize it .
we don &apos;t run as small organisms alone around the world , but they are part of a big ecosystem ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we &apos;re poisoning us or the earth -- but this is just the episode of one of us being done .
now i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of dig in dog working on the moment where we have on one page that we think you &apos;re a dog , first , you know , a dog &apos;s dog , first by making rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; <unk> &quot; just to screw . and therefore they &apos;re beaten .
no , we make &quot; puppy , seat . &quot; -- boom , he can try to go six to 10 .
they &apos;re like golden <unk> .
and i would say if you don &apos;t need it , you might not be able to be .
not only with those puppy , but it &apos;s also with the rest of the family .
these are these things are so simple .
their children are just too easy .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think about working with energy .
because although i used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to make them sound .
and even less if it &apos;s accompanied by <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
one is a white light of light .
64 millimeter 75 multiply .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert is going to be a mile or two a year .
homo erectus introduced the same tool over 25,000 generations .
you can teach them in the lab , a little bit of a bit of a bit , and there &apos;s also a <unk> in other animals , but the exchange of an object against another never happened .
it &apos;s wealth in it , in the satisfaction of your needs , time .
we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence that there .
and when people started doing objects like this far , this was a evidence that a exchange existed between groups .
but who knows how you make a computer computer ?
but i &apos;m also because of the connections that people are doing , and they never have to meet ideas of ideas to meet and mate , i &apos;m also sure that technology continues to continue to improve and therefore the maintenance care will continue better .
this is as high as a building building . i &apos;ve got the liberty of liberty as compared .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they are gone .
if we think about the <unk> <unk> , then the rapid development is usually the problem , because how can we find things that change all all all all all the time ?
i talked about this -- do you know this situation if you don &apos;t get diagnostic ?
what is true people ?
we &apos;re doing a part of their viruses ; they are new , far different .
after 10 other days with fever came back -- still fever -- she has <unk> -- little oxygen in their lungs .
it didn &apos;t even sequence a lot of time .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has ever seen it before .
there could be a huge battery .
let &apos;s invent something that fits the <unk> of the <unk> .
i brought a <unk> with dense density , a high density with high density down , and a molten salt between .
but david is young and smart and he wants to be a <unk> , and so he builds up the first liquid liquid chemical chemistry .
so what did we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the <unk> , six miles off the coast of <unk> , about 20 feet underneath the surface .
so quickly , we realized that our garage was not enough for this growing project .
i started to get me interested in maria and her methods and how they found that kind of thing , and how important she found that children are trying to find things themselves and they weren &apos;t taught them , on an open way .
evolution often is seen than this one path that we &apos;ve elected , but it &apos;s actually a huge number of opportunities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the phase of space space .
our cities are threatened , there are lots of them on shore .
there are stars and forth .
so if we think about <unk> behavior or body language , what it &apos;s called social scientists , then it turns about language . we think about communication .
this expression , as proud , was known by jessica tracy , she showed that sighted people and birth to blind people , they do that if they win at a <unk> .
so i thought about it . you know , you know , it &apos;s true of these people and see how they participate . could you get them to do it , and then would you make them more ?
what happens in a <unk> thing that happens when you happen on the lecture-based level ? how the these little manipulation , these tiny bits of pollen ?
this happens in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes . where can you really apply this ? that &apos;s what we really do ? that &apos;s what we really care about ?
these things . people are kind of going to do you . they show themselves .
she was completely depressed and said , &quot; i haven &apos;t been looking for anything . &quot;
they need your body , privacy and two minutes . it can affect the more life of the big life .
<unk> swimming to get their <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ant , they are going to put a blade of grass up like a jeep .
and they have to have some kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and me important that these ideas are not abused .
and of course they are essentially extinct .
but among all these ideas that are inevitably inevitably spreading around the world , many poisonous ideas .
and as on viruses we don &apos;t try to capture them here .
and in my game , that &apos;s called the <unk> .
we made some ideas on the legs , we went international on tour .
i know you &apos;ll say , &quot; t doesn &apos;t exist in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
no one sounds everybody . no one is familiar with the other .
they will see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to predict that that shouldn &apos;t have happened , but we need to be better , if it &apos;s about trying to answer questions that you need to consider if you think about the consequences and think of the responses .
they work in <unk> . they are driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she earns around two dollars a day , building a <unk> , and told me that they don &apos;t marry children , even before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went and a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to keep the best speech you ever regret .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the interconnection of everything and unity of everything , and his basic value was respect , was respectful of strangers .
who &apos;s fighting while he goes ?
they have begun to go , israel and palestine , in jordan , turkey , in syria .
and so they came and more and more <unk> , and recently , they &apos;ve got a income for support their family .
just go on somebody with another culture , from another country , with another one , which is kind of different and encouragement you in a conversation ; listen to him .
i start where the story began , 1985 in the middle of 1985 .
now tomorrow before she was doing a shower , who had a chance to take a showers ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these fewer homes , where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the homes had a functional shower .
21 percent of what we fix , are follow by <unk> , things that were actually been wrong around .
we did this . he got a little bit .
we found out later that in this region , the cause of disease and death is .
one thing is about what we did , the middle of the <unk> nelson mandela said not far from here : &quot; like slavery and apartheid is not rocket science . it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t mind that if you call me a <unk> , really not .
it sounds really <unk> that &apos;s going on here , but if you try to use this , it &apos;s impressive effective .
i &apos;m going to kick that testimony to you , in believing children should not leave their community to live in a better life .
this is the youngest state of <unk> workforce in america with our <unk> bronx .
this is an image from the bronx bronx who were <unk> children in his house , not in prison so they felt like it .
we gave some back .
if you get big children with small ones , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create this accountability of the <unk> that &apos;s incredible .
now you may wonder about these children .
hold children from this shops .
stephen ritz : a schoolteacher who was south bronx bronx
secondly , i bet that even you see here as a difference here , there &apos;s a increase in the line of the line in the line of the curved line .
ten : <unk> suffered the pig &apos;s heart attack .
people with migraine headaches , who &apos;s an aura , a ligament with a neuron -- here in red -- that moves three to five millimeters per minute .
so the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine , and we need a <unk> . i think we &apos;ve got this right now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> -- an emergent acronym -- for the treatment of other <unk> .
lawyers are concerned on high school in hopes in cognition , contributing strains of <unk> that are the poor patients with the poor patients full of pity .
and half years ago , four of the students were in ushahidi , by the way , called &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; also , &quot; <unk> .
where do you know what matters of what &apos;s important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i &apos;ve got it first time to bring it here .
these people underneath the barrier , i call them <unk> , because they &apos;re really going to be excluded from the process to share their knowledge with the world .
they have to use together as a platform to develop their online health program , which teach the world teaching teaching teaching teaching teachers .
yeah , books , maybe maybe you &apos;re sold 100 or 1,000 spending a year .
it doesn &apos;t be surprised that it &apos;s all like , or ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so this isn &apos;t very hard .
the days of the <unk> are over when people say , &quot; well we would have like three or three times from our country to see how that works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use some thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s something like an electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a 100 laptop , you can &apos;t do it .
and this is the <unk> .
you click on things and rigid screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s better opportunity . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing lucy on a big effect , which is information and we can &apos;t keep up with it .
thank you .
i think most people think that a hiv-positive mother , always their child .
this isn &apos;t possible . this isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s all good . they &apos;re going to live .
first , stop the <unk> .
two years ago , one of mothers gave me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health care system ?
the <unk> is just how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of gray substance at age four to 22 years , it takes your childhood in childhood , which shows this graph . it &apos;s in early youth .
the idea that your father was singing in public , so they were going to be .
this is the <unk> that we built together .
after the first year , it was invited from the <unk> of the museum of austria , to install it in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that there stayed there online , 24 hours day .
but at night , while we were traveling , i asked the <unk> , like the <unk> decided that they would have last <unk> .
and here &apos;s the outcome .
a place where my family has been working on the world &apos;s office .
honestly , i don &apos;t know what it has been with shepherd , but they &apos;re immensely <unk> .
the first thing you realize at the risk of climate is is the terrible force of the gas force .
he put it up for my leg , i lifts me up , i bring me to a vehicle and i can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about you . &quot;
we calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct <unk> in the world .
it just simply , technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect <unk> like technology .
it &apos;s the <unk> of my favorite .
i would like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is in everything .
you should know that every community is already increasing the number of food .
i led three main lines into antarctica .
but tells me where they are and what country they are . &quot;
we &apos;ve been exploring the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> for birds , one of the most important <unk> in the pacific .
and we &apos;re standing as the rest of the world in front of the world .
he coined the phrase &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
of course , the <unk> and the open sea , but the <unk> that everyone would love to look at was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with enormous <unk> and enormous ones .
now there are <unk> , immediate , automatic <unk> , free , for many of our devices , even on smartphones .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there are no conclusions , no single answer , but if you &apos;re a huge model like i are , they say , &quot; well , what are telling us the data ? &quot;
instead he has been very carefully documenting what happens over again when technology is in an environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , there , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually an yves <unk> painting .
i mean , this was at least what i did happy .
well , there was a question that i was going to put me in mind for a while : well , i can do more of things that i want to do in design , and less of those i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it &apos;s on front of it .
they stand a terrible situation without exit .
they are going to have hospitals .
as a <unk> , for example , i was looked at extraordinarily gifted in <unk> because i had known the <unk> , and i know how i need to use <unk> , and i can quickly work with the <unk> .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in many of my friends who are still in their &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 90s , still active as a <unk> , farmers , vote and doctors .
as christian <unk> changed changed and made from <unk> <unk> , young men in america and canada who were eating batman and north rates , who were on the bible .
the case of <unk> , the last muslim muslim europe of europe .
the greatest evil , <unk> , doesn &apos;t want these rocks to stop it . so he &apos;s trying to stop them from the concert .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and if comes out ? &quot;
<unk> : there &apos;s got something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when one group itself is identified as extremely identified .
<unk> <unk> : from islam to <unk> superhero
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing something weird about myself , i discovered something weird about myself .
so they have the eye and then come up with the concepts .
but of course china has an enormous population .
but what this shows is that this kind of visualization of information is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure of being concerned with you , because they are visual .
the <unk> is named after the eden project .
why does it smell like potato or 30-second ? so there are two theories .
and one theory allows you to work with a .
now after some months of searching , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule called <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly the same vibration .
this is the foundation for the device that these two people built from ford .
they made it ... and it &apos;s made exactly like coumarin .
this was a good thing .
now , at the time , there are lots of things on the switch that i want to pay attention .
and she didn &apos;t have any idea of the context where it landed .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say goodbye , neither my mom , my father , my brother , my brother , my brother , my cousins , my cousins , my cousins , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my cousins , my grandparents
i &apos;m reports from this . i &apos;m reporting from it , just to say that i had two things when i left the orphanage i wanted to do . this was one of my family .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope you &apos;re going around there and find small parts .
he had a <unk> and has to be <unk> from others , female and probably much smaller family members to be able to be able to be at his age of 12 years .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation , or will it lead to that we will be the returns , which exists most shortest of earth ?
but are we going to do that or are we going to take nature from the process ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was in a shop for <unk> , i wanted to buy <unk> -- we had a <unk> plan .
this meant a basic change for me .
my hint : about 70 layers of this , <unk> <unk> .
do you want to know how obsessed i really am ? this project is just for me , and yet i went so far to buy a chinese newspaper from san francisco to put a <unk> <unk> .
when we went into the way of the light of the spectacular blue mountains in sydney , it was perfect <unk> : sunshine , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too heavy . &quot;
and if you &apos;re going to run again , just with a <unk> . &quot;
i remember my dad pushed me out in the wheelchair and i was just walking from above to down and felt the sun on my face .
they said me , &quot; we &apos;re going to put you because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was brought me the <unk> , and i called the school , i was <unk> and said i wanted to take a book book .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m working in instinctively .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> of which richard serra flies .
how hell should i make a telephone in three weeks , if i &apos;ve developed these things that developed over millions of years ?
each of these elements could be on the wall as a kind of <unk> .
he was the highest taxpayer in my days .
i look at a single layer of pollen , and how they flow -- how they flow and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the <unk> , it was built from aluminum , as opposed to <unk> .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you ask it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally totally .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made by kevlar .
after i had done my dr. my dr. loved , i was fortunate to be member of a <unk> who used him for first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these <unk> .
it uses red bioluminescence like a <unk> <unk> around the animals that are blind for red light , and can see it without seen .
so they use it to find food and partners .
i urge you to give me another science that has still using hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i made the value of the <unk> .
and on the five june 1995 , i heard a noisy bang on the slice that changed my life and ended up a duck .
and here are the duck again .
after the price changed my life changed .
another example of the effects of <unk> on the lives of birds .
so if i think this thing like this -- this is the sound of purple .
depending on how i &apos;m going to do it , i can hear music and write music .
one of them is &quot; i have a <unk> &quot; martin luther king , and the other is hitler .
now , you &apos;re often seeing more often , that former <unk> are the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to say anything else that could be used against one . &quot;
absolutely critical .
and what happens when teachers want order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t trust law . why don &apos;t they trust the law ?
it &apos;s so that freedom has a structure of structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest change : we need to have authority for interpretation and application of law , and he would be told .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise they &apos;re not going to suffer a standstill .
you can have boundaries for interest to calculate the <unk> , and for the fees they can take .
well , if you think about it , it really hard round columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad paying job .
he had just a <unk> .
but the problem , to leave on rules and incentives , it &apos;s that they &apos;re focused on international activity , and they &apos;re focused on planning activity in two ways .
so smart <unk> are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that some smart <unk> can maintain this for unlimited time .
why did this idea spread ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was an remarkable time . i &apos;m going to make the mentality more specifically that we -- america and the rest of the world .
this was <unk> , the turtle .
we &apos;ve got it with a full of climate change .
what i want to show you is what they would need to transport 21 pounds tall .
what would have been if they had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the trucks you just saw , somewhere here in the <unk> .
part of the problem is that the <unk> self is overwhelmed from thinking about a nuclear disaster .
it was sent me by somebody who &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> , and fact , it was hard to be .
there are lots of black sheep out there that did the wrong things and the problems still have .
we can show our results . we can do things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s <unk> , to have a dangerous working environment .
imagine if we could , because if we could do it , we could get more .
governments who are doing most progress , are governments , found ways to make shared value in business business , instead of able to see the actor who has told the unique .
maybe i can cut here , i can see the brain , and i can change my heart .
i want to zoom in .
come back to me in the 19th century , right to june 24th .
we could certainly all be productive , if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us much time .
they studied <unk> to the british government to get money for building babbage &apos;s machines because they thought that these machines would have enormous practical impacts for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t only allow them fewer wealthy men , but they also also to look at the <unk> , rather than answering any questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
if you start looking at the very small stuff -- this person has written an entire article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of those aren &apos;t old enough , they don &apos;t idea how this infection was happening -- was by these floppy infections .
there are about 10,000 programs .
this would be the frequency in which you take every of the 26 letters of the <unk> in random by randomly chosen by randomly chosen .
everywhere life is , you will have this distribution , unlike this distribution .
too hot , hot . hot . hot .
the officer says , &quot; are you safe ? hey buddy , you &apos;re sure you lost this ? &quot;
this is the data from one single survey in a single district in zambia , a few years ago , i &apos;ve got a few years ago .
as you see , bruce willis was a much more hair .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had time at all time or put it into my plan , and i didn &apos;t just at holiday .
instead of teaching people how you put the forms forms on the mobile phones , we should develop software that allows you to do that , without practicing without any exercise .
this is less than i deserves when i was for two weeks as an consultant .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or the balloon , we need to change the altitude .
it can be in spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need to do it .
i promised me that i would be the next time i would fly around the world , no fuel will be taken away from fossil rights to be secure , not by being threatened by the <unk> .
i think you need a pilot on the airplane who can talk to students who can talk to students with politicians during the flight , and do it really to an human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
this is why all people who believe in this spirit of mind are welcome to be part of this teams .
now you just need one laptop .
anyway , we was a magical place for us .
the next thing i want to do clarity is what this problem is and what it isn &apos;t .
this is crazy , really if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop for a second .
in fact , we &apos;re the first generation of the disease and this extreme poverty in your eyes , you see it and say it . it &apos;s not to stand .
it &apos;s going on the nerves .
this year is a test for us , specifically for the leaders of the most talented states that are begun and see the history history .
people find this slowly .
and with this one campaign than our chute , my organization , i have data , data , and other groups that are doing energy and the enthusiasm from the back from hollywood to the south america of america .
step forward step forward , take forward , a teacher , a schoolteacher , a book , and life saved .
and the idea that the internet that has changed their lives , change a country -- and a continent that &apos;s just like this to analogous , let alone -- just like digital -- bow bow me .
lips are not blond , but volcanoes .
now your job is to recognize what these shapes shape is bouba , and what kiki .
now if you &apos;re not just <unk> , then this sentence , literally , is wrong .
if we solve a problem or explore something new , we compare that , we compare that what we already know about what is unknown .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m happy to be here .
they even don &apos;t fit in all of these images .
pm : i don &apos;t think .
how are you talking about it , you personally , but also with your earrings ?
some of my reporters were arrested .
this clearly shows a very different picture of yemen .
my heart was a half times tall .
this is a list of side effects : if you eat too much salt like a <unk> and burning cheese sandwich , then they probably end up in intensive care unit .
but soon i showed symptoms for <unk> , and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i probably never see my home .
i sat there and talked about a little bit of hard with the <unk> of transplants and asked him what i would do when i would have a transplant , could make me prepare .
i sat on a dozen machines that kept me alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these things is in america has gone out 200 percent in america .
and also , interesting is that what &apos;s been interesting is that the same businesses sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine , the &quot; <unk> &quot; , now they &apos;re the antidote to the antidote -- one and the same company .
we also launched as a <unk> .
what would our children say to us when they were once every day : today , i had a little bit of <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a bit bisphenol a.
so the problem is that you in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , that connection doesn &apos;t see this connection .
here you see this accumulation of the <unk> <unk> next to the airport from los angeles .
i offered five cents for every single <unk> .
the <unk> cannot be <unk> , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , red , the distribution of the fence .
they &apos;re like a mouse that looks at the leg of an elephant , and the most part of them stays hidden .
it looks like it from their pollen and <unk> comes from all directions around us .
redwood trees have a enormous surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky because they tend to be something called <unk> -- repetition .
<unk> gives the canopy tree , just like a cathedral , and help the tree , live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely clear that to see .
but recently , all the doors has been torn open and break the walls off .
this was 25 years ago .
so for example , let &apos;s look at the <unk> .
how do these people do money with these infected computers ?
and they can do it to watch how we work -- and try to find a path , the <unk> that we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see a <unk> here , <unk> / d , and if you open this file file on your computer , then this program will downloaded and collected this program .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the hallmark of the mercedes is the mercedes .
we need to make some ways of making sure that everything keeps playing , even when the computers are .
but i haven &apos;t got anything .
this person surrounds himself with consultants .
why should we think what he says ? &quot;
what does his future look like ?
these forces completely disappear , no one &apos;s <unk> 2011 .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and take this kind of computations seriously and participate , because this would change things , but it would change things on two more different ways .
that means that we can see a copy of a copy , if it has only used one part of the <unk> , it has a slow motion and it &apos;s got a viral system and <unk> .
and the happy pair , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their <unk> back and saw that her videos suddenly had been spread like a <unk> .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go into the distance .
this is what he taught him since he was five years old .
i &apos;m thankful for the fact that i had a mentor like mau that taught me how to do it .
what is it that driving yourself in life ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing and do it ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have this -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right managers .
in this moment , aware or unconscious . right now where you &apos;re willing to focus on something , you can do something that is meaning and whatever it means , it makes emotion .
have ever done what was done , and they went to say , &quot; i was ! &quot;
there &apos;s bored . so , god in his infinite wisdom gave us another human desire : uncertainty .
but this is true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through prayers through prayers , through &quot; linear in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m through . the last element is emotion .
jewish man with family in occupied , someone in new york who had died if he had been on the day at the day , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist , and he clearly said .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools that have a huge number of people who can tell their stories , people everywhere around the world .
the color of particles correspond to the kind of feeling -- happy , positive emotion shaped flashing color .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was on the computer all day . &quot;
and if i go over here , the list starts running , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
the 10 themes radiation and circle circle and circle .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click this and see this iconic picture of betty ford , as she kisses his husband &apos;s coffin .
you can see quote too well if you want to read germ climate change .
so people think clouds as something that is in ways .
and we started in life . it has tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries around earth .
they just need one step out outside , and look at that that usually , so commonplace , so commonplace is that everybody else is missing .
so look high , admire the short-lived beauty , and think about it to wear the head in the clouds .
they had 25,000 footage that would have done this : &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago , when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> , it was a huge machine .
these footage comes from virtual autopsy .
here you can see how the knife invaded in heart .
it &apos;s a small , mechanical pen that has built in its interior very , very quick <unk> .
now this is really interesting project .
so he does it .
so , very talented people .
i was just going to get the kids as often as possible to bring the academic stuff with the real world .
it &apos;s not all but it &apos;s an incredible amount of <unk> summary , all we know about nature nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into detail , why we think of the universe , but it makes it out of mathematics and trying to explain physics that we know .
but i always went into my career , but always something in me .
in 2001 i visited her during a village club .
we got lots of <unk> .
this shows the first degree in 2004 . 2004 .
he &apos;s just a moment ago , and was filmed recently with someone that you all know .
each is being specialized in a <unk> problem , but being specialized in different scientific disciplines .
i got my first computer as teenagers in accra and it was a really great device .
he explores the brain using mri and he says that this is the beautiful brain that he ever scanned .
so on the next few slides i &apos;m going to tell you about this briefly .
transistors are getting smaller to make this that , and that has done our technology much better .
our dna is behind this lens .
i had a gut gut feeling that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call them the <unk> of the <unk> because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
we can see more detail in our galaxy than anywhere else .
and this brings us a factor of 20 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to this idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put lots of stuff there .
it draws on one side much more than the other and the cloud will ripped apart .
and i hope i &apos;m sure you at least i &apos;ve convinced you that we have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
one day i was on the streets new york , and i saw some kids playing cars between stairs , cars and fire machines .
so for example , people liked pieces in the eleventh century , which ended up so ended .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , about the big &quot; what &quot; god , to appreciate god and prices .
and through new and enhanced instruments broke the era of the <unk> .
but one question stays : what happens when music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and emotion over time time time
we &apos;re actually standing at the beginning of a new technology .
until year 1945 , they brought it up to 100,000 year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where i should start .
wow , a volunteers , great !
but recently , my interest in looking at a new view of a new view , because there &apos;s circumstance where they can do something really cool .
well , i think this is the most fundamental development of crowd-accelerated innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important .
we get honest talks from them .
let me imagine this point sam <unk> .
but even if you get a screen , there &apos;s more than just sent over words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and online data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how <unk> worldwide innovation foster .
first : i need to be a service as a speaker of the audience and talk about what i will give him instead instead of saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and they &apos;re fun to design their own , ultimate or worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , like this kind of kind of <unk> that we call superpower .
these kinds tests are used , ok ?
somebody asked &quot; why ? &quot;
he thought he could reverse the ripples . couldn &apos;t it .
i think there are three major changes , in areas of transparency , choice and <unk> where people have truly truly power .
how do we do this ?
my favorite , sharon versa , says , around the world there are more photos from your mind than each other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , people were looking at the <unk> and questionnaires of helpful tools because they took on specific areas of certain areas that a meaningful sense of sense .
so i wish all of all a big weekends .
reading dna and writing , becomes easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now you may ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
if you have this whole thing that you have in the world , it can lead this to a <unk> program that allows to do biotechnology .
the kingdom says , his laws allow him , strangers or <unk> , which is an economic risk or a risk of energy or a risk of health or the health of the state .
these laws are a strike in the face of science and based on prejudice and ignorance and an aversion of traditions and one lasts .
why are you going pregnant if you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 people people who inject drugs .
so social workers , they distribute condoms , they &apos;re providing condoms in endangered <unk> , not even thrown from the police , called names or randomly imprisoned .
there were children born , people died there .
building office buildings work are now dated .
they &apos;ve got the line off , the road , down the river underneath the road , and you get from one end of the end of the other without crossing the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny homes . &quot;
also need to be shared .
their liver makes oil spills .
and they killed around 12,000 sharks at the time , by actually a <unk> from the <unk> bay in <unk> island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag finds out the location of a shark , depending on the time and sunset , water and depth .
let &apos;s look at the <unk> , which has to do with the genes that are passed by parents , then we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , one of 10 diversity than others .
so <unk> did this research and found out that the size of the 9,000 is around 9,000 .
and what was okay . we were wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists whether they were from a male or females .
so i decided to give the retailer .
your bodies are replaced with <unk> apart , and they &apos;re destined to be used for some <unk> to make money -- people tell themselves many such stories .
no business did not done with anybody .
my journalism may not fit on other continents or other countries , in my part of africa , but it &apos;s going to work . go around corruption , questions people immediately ask , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in the early 1980s , two blocks from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be a <unk> .
and had these people ever met a victim of their earrings ?
now today , you can be in 29 states , in more than half the country , because of its sexuality are fired .
eventually i understood that my mission &quot; gay &quot; was wrong , because there was a million of different <unk> of gay .
at least i hope that it &apos;s harder to make your human rights .
first : the world is , it &apos;s always been good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the <unk> .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that were the soldier .
on three ways : the conventional way is called .
this is stanley carrillo , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he asked himself : &quot; could the holocaust happen , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my gentleman , who is responsible if it happened to him ? &quot;
stanley carrillo and i was both graduated from high school , by james <unk> in the bronx .
here &apos;s the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> of the other . <unk> of itself .
alexander <unk> says that the border between good and evil through heart of one human .
and i hired this experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everyone could do &quot; no big thing to jump on .
it &apos;s a puzzle that was really difficult .
we have a self .
but on my left retina is a <unk> which is labeled through red arrow .
there &apos;s only one <unk> , which is the body .
i promise i don &apos;t say anything except that it &apos;s supposed to be afraid .
and the autobiographical self has expanded memory , thinking , imagination is triggered .
thank you . thank you for hip-hop -- and i got a hill .
now i &apos;m going to tell you this -- i &apos;m talking about it and <unk> me , i &apos;m ridiculous because i think feminism has partly the job , admit that aesthetics and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a heroine .
you &apos;ve been able to see , i didn &apos;t put myself on fire .
she spoke about <unk> , she founded <unk> , they organized <unk> , they &apos;re friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s this <unk> that is that that &apos;s homo sapiens from earlier .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves that read the electrical activity in my brain , while i think this talk .
we &apos;ve got lots of prototypes and products for life that you can control with thoughts , like <unk> appliances or a <unk> chair .
this headset is connected wireless with an ipad or smartphone .
how these children can use their new minds to their recovery is becoming many of the harmful and social <unk> , which are being diagnosed as different as different , facing themselves .
she understood the power of human narration and that the value we &apos;re on people , changes , and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities .
temporarily , and quite unexpected , they gave them .
this specialist didn &apos;t retain this specialist in my eyes .
i was a track i know well .
and quite slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe in me didn &apos;t really know , not all the pearl <unk> in all of us .
i &apos;m . i i was .
what we have is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but if you feel that it &apos;s great , and with the other , with only a small change in attitude , feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that has to take place , which is about the amount of control that we have about our tax .
for <unk> percent of these money , you could have able to install them in your trains , which would not reduce the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the better better work .
i &apos;m not asking for the full locations of one of the other .
sometimes lines are very , very long .
i think the risk of the world today is that the field of economics is understood as a progressive discipline to human psychology .
the average answer is 50 to 60 percent .
it will be told you don &apos;t even hurt themselves , nor hurt .
gee !
they are 20 , 30 years .
but this wouldn &apos;t mean that i have a coin with two sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our bones of visible universe .
thank you .
hyperscore had enough enough , we had sufficient effects in children around the world , and now people who have been .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful that wants to live forever .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old and i have <unk> .
this is actually the musical score of <unk> piece that he completely made completely hyperscore .
odysseus would say , &quot; well , let &apos;s make a <unk> .
there &apos;s some present self .
i have to write five sides on day , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;ll show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last time machine machine machine machine machine , is something i &apos;ve created with hal <unk> together , which was introduced me from my co-author at a previous project , bill <unk> .
it &apos;s pretty good that it doesn &apos;t affect people because if one of the faces smiles , then the other face starts frowning .
this is one of the reasons that much of what we think about for western science , math and engineering , actually in the first few centuries of our <unk> , <unk> and <unk> developed .
x is the unknown because there &apos;s no &quot; sh . &quot;
so it doesn &apos;t be surprised that if you speak with mental illness , you probably have stories of mental suffering , shame and discrimination in almost all life expectancy .
and something more than 30 years ago , the nations came into the world in <unk> and gave this legendary explanation .
what &apos;s it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about fish .
look at this smooth , you see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually subsidies .
this was in the early stages of <unk> , when india wanted to be driving his <unk> -- as means to grow -- china with his <unk> growth from eight , 9 , 10 percent looked at and asked himself : why can we not ?
it &apos;s not a happy situation , but they have trust and the guts , and say , &quot; we &apos;ve calculated .
green carbon , the emissions between deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon combined 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what these things don &apos;t mean , dick -- sydney by the way .
i also loved these intellectuals .
and he said he was essentially exactly the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move through the experiment , you don &apos;t need to worry about how they move .
we removed all the entire <unk> , and the <unk> color , which just these just cool <unk> .
many of these ideas fins into the produced trailer called trailer .
if you think about how to get your children to tinkering school , they will come back with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let you go with your own conditions and trust me , they &apos;re learning things that they can &apos;t learn from the <unk> of the learning books .
if you want to throw away a device next time you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s everything . this is number of things . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here my wife here today , four months after today , four months after this , in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a completely <unk> <unk> , not only sharing ?
this is one of the seven areas of existing <unk> that didn &apos;t get into all .
and so it came out that in the years of building europe began to buy europe , first thousands , then hundreds of thousands and eventually millions of individual parts , small paper that should bring one out of the hell of hell .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as edison invented the light bulb , it looked like this .
you need to be fairly smart , and although i don &apos;t have any <unk> , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid and bring it into the world .
they literally have the door of the door .
if you listen to your listening to your listening , ears both ears are both speakers .
we have the problem that the antenna is <unk> .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
recently i &apos;ve created some fairly sophisticated <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
and i drew her own special card for every person , and he wrote her names on it , they did it and sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to see .
and i believe that it &apos;s <unk> , my valuable and diverse life on this earth exactly what &apos;s happening .
in this mode , he &apos;s trying to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
we think about future technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you see it , you see the amino acids with the amino acids , where they have different charges .
and through a series of engineering , you can do one from a billion fish , which is what you want to do , like a battery or solar solar cell grow .
in this case you see <unk> out .
if you ask people asking , where do you get when you have something important ?
i &apos;ve been sitting on my desk , i used my expensive computer .
what happens then happens -- sometimes you have this days where you wake up eight o &apos;clock morning or seven or when you get up , and you say , man , i &apos;m not working well .
in the office , most interruptions and distractions that people actually stop from work , <unk> .
we all know that that &apos;s true . you would never have an <unk> meeting that they would never have a <unk> meeting .
so meetings and managers are today two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , once week , no one else , no one wants to talk about .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m doing this now seven years and have no idea what the future will look like .
but if you ask people about three most important things that you &apos;re wearing , no matter what culture , gender and whatever context -- most people say , : key , money , if you own one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big but we &apos;ve got to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the air , and then -- the owner of your pressure takes 10 or 20 percent of the time , and there &apos;s the rest of the amount of dollars on my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he &apos;s sort of a tribute to the values of the .
and then with the spread of this mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the history that we &apos;ll tell later about it .
what were we talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research that show how the <unk> of healthy lifestyles can affect a world in genetic level . he says that if we live healthy life better , more food , and more food , our brain cells actually grow up .
until i say told you who said .
within this context , we can feel regret over many different things .
when i went home after night after i got my tattoo , i was almost all night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another one .
i mean , even the dumb &quot; answer to all &quot; <unk> can let us go back for days .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;m a <unk> .
i thought i would try to try to talk about my ted wish , what i &apos;m trying to do , and how do this fit what they &apos;re trying to do .
no in india . now there are at least half a million active .
and i came along the thought that somebody in this entire ancestor have had to think about the organization of the community .
and so we did that to do that .
listen to this : less than four than four 10 10 10 of one percent of those who were treated , they used to take their drugs or or the <unk> in their own own treatment .
it &apos;s worth an attempt and i think it was successful .
the <unk> aren &apos;t rocket rights .
if the <unk> has used , they will create 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , to green school .
low-income women from bali food on food and they use secrets that are just known their grandmothers .
we need somebody who &apos;s coming and studied this .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal chords were still healthy and not mold . &quot;
then apple alex out , the best voice i &apos;ve heard about .
there was one reason for this : i was .
the <unk> isn &apos;t .
but that &apos;s not .
initially , the internet was a <unk> tool , and now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to leave for my real life .
&quot; it &apos;s human , it &apos;s human .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the test test .
before before i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what are you living ? &quot;
we treated two more sophisticated sides than one page , because so it &apos;s how it &apos;s true .
so what is the lesson behind ?
but one day my grandmother said : &quot; no , this time you &apos;re not about it .
it was happening and terrible things happened with me .
all lost hope in my cure .
so they went to her <unk> and all collected their <unk> furniture -- they gave me pots and <unk> , <unk> , everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away that street is and you don &apos;t know whether they go straight and hear cars and forth , and they had a awful accident that she had brought it into this situation .
i thought that for some reason time time has stayed and only for family and friends .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the <unk> of <unk> .
can we say we would have all the symmetries in the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t switch it because i &apos;ve built a little hurdle , isn &apos;t it ?
if i put a magic train , and then one , it makes a third .
galois has created a bunch of laws of how these tables , these symmetries are interacting .
one of these symmetry are called <unk> .
instead , all mess , i want to know how many digits have got the numbers . ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects have basically -- please spell it for me .
first : worse diet , maybe shorter food .
thomas edison had a software software company today .
penicillin was discovered in brazil , but even 1940 , no commercial useful amounts of them made .
it was the origin of the <unk> that had his 50th birthday last year .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos happen now . let &apos;s make the best thing .
works with every computer and browser . minus , minus , minus and text .
they don &apos;t need to delete them either .
and so , some kind of information that i &apos;m inspired by , my real desktop .
a means that you would be something like a <unk> , so you get more traditional desktop , and things are redefined .
now i get to my music with my music , and there &apos;s no limits on .
but i think that &apos;s the point , it &apos;s metaphors with bite , and you want to suggest this today that we think about contemporary math is a bit more rethink -- not just not just any basic , but math in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 physicists here here at wall street and i &apos;m one of them &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies that may have on amazon .
these are not <unk> ; this is culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually interesting .
go . shake . shake ! louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections without traffic traffic , so , we &apos;re saving lots of lives , but there &apos;s a commercial goods .
the answer is , to allow cars to get out of this side of the street .
warren buffet had recommended this : honestly , what works and what doesn &apos;t and this was to a annual thing .
indeed , we see the most common disease , that it &apos;s the only disease disease because of living in africa , actually emerged several things to get the <unk> .
this means that economics is in these areas , because it &apos;s simply going to be much as much .
but that alone doesn &apos;t give us any <unk> .
not only was they were weak ; she &apos;s getting weaker .
a schoolteacher &apos;s impact is going to be measured the achievement of its class -- measured by <unk> -- in a year .
but it &apos;s not in any relationship to be a better teacher .
&quot; what happens ? &quot;
and these questions without those courses couldn &apos;t only be available on the internet , but you can &apos;t get dvds available to each time that everyone has access to a group of the best teachers .
conventional vessels , like this beaker , need eight to 10 hours .
and the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought as young artists thought he was a painter and he was living after his school school .
if i look at these pictures , i put out the smoke back to my clothes when i went home on my family night .
my parents were great . they said , &quot; we know that you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us for so powerful ?
this is momentous general in boston .
so , the pathologist takes the dna , <unk> it , it &apos;s looking underneath the microscope and then then then then the operating room .
so in this collection , a solution filled with these <unk> molecules , combined with an dye here , showing green , inject green in the <unk> of one cancer cancer , can &apos;t have normal tissue not separate these molecules .
with <unk> lymph nodes as part of our current cells , the surgeon is looking for the single nodes , the lymph node where cancer starts .
if nerves are damage , they can cause paralysis , and we can get it pain .
if we put these two samples ...
we know that this is doable , and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousands of different forms of things that we learn .
it will affect the normal circuits in the same way that they want to fix .
and one morning in 2004 , we &apos;ve tried it and it &apos;s been working for the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already , you have a little inch cells of these cells to power learning .
and it goes . now .
i want to end with a story of which we think might find some clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually can see the walls and go to the small platform and use his eyes .
buildings are colonized with the air that are carried microbes that are carried through the windows and the mechanical speed .
and if you stop outside , there &apos;s microbes that are in general with <unk> and dirt .
obviously i &apos;m very strong person , as you see , so i didn &apos;t worry that this thing 20 blocks .
and the same thing is true for the question of who was going on my neighborhood in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;ve experimenting with is something called google share , basically you just take one abstract concept and search at google , and then you &apos;re looking at these results after the names of somebody .
this is britney britney britney britney . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , they link one most .
what was normal for us 40 years ago -- that &apos;s not rarely about stories between generations -- is rarely .
by 1939 , the film older than most grandparents were older .
was history good ?
why don &apos;t we see this with the same passion as that read ?
in california they will send them to a <unk> : &quot; this product contains chemicals that are the state of california as the cause of cancer , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so we could have a <unk> system that needs humility , and for my profession as an architect , it &apos;s an expected that words &apos; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; since &quot; eternal motor &quot; didn &apos;t mention more at the same point .
i don &apos;t know whether you remember his answer , but it was like , &quot; the penguins didn &apos;t end because the stone ran out . &quot;
and this can be a whole thing for berlin , but we &apos;re built in houston , and all the windows are closed . and all the windows that were not for using the use of damage , it &apos;s actually a vertical .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since since we &apos;ve been the 4,000 most common research companies in a database that we &apos;re going to provide in six weeks of public .
now we &apos;ve got 160 kilograms of heavy cameras to learn the internet production on the internet .
we started using commercial use of buildings , so that all people have centers and places where they can stop .
and this is the <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell anyone that we knew all this because we didn &apos;t know that .
for example , they &apos;re saying that the <unk> of microsoft started at 9 / 11 , yahoo at march 12 , 2008 , and then the other : google , facebook , skype , apple and so on .
i elected sweden because sweden was similar to the laws of the united states .
and whoever told you , he didn &apos;t think about it long enough .
their emails was read and she talked about her and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right on privacy , there cannot be true freedom of freedom , and therefore no effective democracy can exist . &quot;
many people , if you see a bright human brain , say , &quot; normally it looks different when you have shown a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , are the areas that the surrounding wires go through .
and the nature of a certain cell , basically , to be biochemistry because it &apos;s determined that the 25,000 genes are turned on and where threshold they are turned on .
now they are coming in the game and make basic anatomic .
we take this material material and put it on one called <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their entire genome and they &apos;re trying to find <unk> that are linked to the genes .
whether that depends from the individual genetic background or your experiences , we don &apos;t know .
we know how we can eliminate poverty , we need to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s some more questions .
how can you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , it was all right .
and there were lots of experiments that came to the same outcome , so i &apos;m just going to tell you about one .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of them . and we need to steer politics .
and maybe we start small , with things where we &apos;re secure that they &apos;re .
it &apos;s more suicides than science work and a lack of data about the effects of <unk> , asking the question of how you &apos;re going to say this , but <unk> duflo demonstrates what they &apos;re going to do , and what damage -- with help .
so we start because africa is , in a certain way , in terms of change .
and the legend reported that alexander was traveling through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with over 1,000 languages , and it wouldn &apos;t move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to discuss this from the perspective of the world .
in tanzania , last week , last week was called the standard for <unk> .
if i had to ask them , &quot; what was the world &apos;s office in 2005 ? &quot; would you think about egypt ?
because there are fascinating ways .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey that we want to be all to be inspired and feel one with the universe , which life is .
you &apos;re a switch on -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought it .
i &apos;m going to make this run , so you can take this kind of way , and i &apos;m going to describe my reactions when i saw this for the first time .
exactly .
ok , you move , raise your right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just see the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
again .
kb : how often did you feel that ?
let your eyes close , five , four , three , two , one .
just if you want the pressure released , they make a <unk> , so , but only if you want the pressure released .
do you want to try it ?
you feel a certain sensation , and if you feel that emotion feels like , i want you to throw the water into the bottle .
there &apos;s another thing i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in the <unk> .
kb : ok . think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first of us shows us keith barry , how our brain can make our bodies -- with a trick of it also works by <unk> , and then he actually refers to the audience into some stunning brain brain .
i &apos;m going to be .
this isn &apos;t for the one of four . that &apos;s for all four .
i watched religious as well as a youngster were obsessed with morality .
the <unk> is almost zero if there &apos;s no stimulation for the <unk> .
they then get the message of the computer : &quot; person 1 has sent them to them .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is taking the basic engineering for 80 percent .
i just found the molecule .
he said me again , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
we &apos;ve got men testosterone testosterone .
this tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new few emotionally .
and it &apos;s easy to flourish a brain in the <unk> .
to bring the machine to walk , you need many , many people .
or should you not do this ?
they said quite <unk> : &quot; you &apos;ve given us a machine that &apos;s only working on english , so we &apos;ve taught ourselves english so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by destroying a ridiculous statement .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
how will this happen tomorrow ?
we need to undo this imbalance , by mindfulness .
i think that &apos;s right here that &apos;s true .
i &apos;ve asked quite incredible questions -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will they end ? &quot;
and just one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i &apos;ve just lost the thread .
and then , <unk> went to local <unk> in uttar pradesh and found that he was passed into the official <unk> .
so this area is <unk> .
so , <unk> is in the privileged layer that is able to pay several of them to numbers and tens of households , common .
after these four children , you see young colleagues who are all been killed their children who were killed .
and then then there was one one who sat down for me and later , and then he was going to get it back to me , so i had to make him <unk> so he &apos;s <unk> .
with 16 , children are going to leave the orphanage , even though they can &apos;t get anywhere .
one of the interesting things is of course , is the combination of the naked hand on the instrument and technology , and of course , what he said about listening to our young people .
now my career could continue a little longer .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from it from it from the sound of the bat .
or we do this and believe that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
individual hits . but why can i not do that when i learn a piece of music ?
in this conference , <unk> <unk> shows the dove of <unk> evelyn , why listening to music has a much more than sound to his eardrum .
and it became this big , until the point where there was a year in <unk> &apos; thanksgiving , and rick <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; millions of people on television .
but this isn &apos;t exactly what &apos;s interesting about it .
cp : you were lucky that it isn &apos;t going live to you .
peace and love were mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what they should keep it .
this is 10 times longer than the mammals needed to reach their maximum size , and all these habitats .
we similar to dinosaurs very , and they are unusual in our basic attitude towards life .
basically it &apos;s a country that had no adequate .
this is an adult <unk> in his jaw .
paul has never never seen a fossil that .
these are all <unk> . there &apos;s a bunch of opportunities .
i became artists and started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;ve been concerned about this question for centuries -- how to bring these children in science .
bad news for tulu tulu has the same idea , underneath the olympic <unk> and paula radcliffe that is a tremendously , filled with the fastest <unk> of all time .
show me an animal with <unk> and gills , then it has to do something with water .
we didn &apos;t have our physical strength because we &apos;re the largest <unk> in the jungle .
now , emily <unk> -- one of 500 <unk> and <unk> -- they end up on eighth 10 , although she was all done all the <unk> , even though she was doing all the <unk> to fill her baby -- and defeat <unk> <unk> .
this is all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
listening to these <unk> focus on these <unk> , where you failed , if you have four hours .
so , robotics , it was always been working with things , not with people -- with security , not for a social way that would be for us and really help people to accept robots as part of our daily life .
cookie monster is all , evil .
the <unk> was a experimenter from our group where they used three three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can be in the living in their grandchildren in a way that it isn &apos;t possible today .
and the third possibility was a simple diary with paper and pencil , because this is the most potent that you normally use when you start a <unk> and <unk> .
another important idea is this notion of the <unk> of the character .
i got style , laugh , really hard , because it &apos;s not drum , you heard , you &apos;re not talking about it .
walking away , doesn &apos;t get far . i fire : &quot; bang ! &quot; the fool is going to be between two <unk> cars .
if he wrote on a <unk> , i was front of the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and films , but i also do lots of books and some of advertising , all with the same concept .
from photography , this libertarian is going to be this <unk> , they make deep desire and <unk> . what you can &apos;t have , you want to do .
how they do in consciousness , without that we know that , without that , and how that happens .
it &apos;s very commercially .
and then you turn the photograph that he shoots , and suddenly it &apos;s quite serious , and maybe less accessible .
eighty-five percent of global health care costs in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet , 90 percent of the resources in the west .
just to treat . look at the location in mauritius .
but if you tell them , so we &apos;re trying to do the same thing in nigeria , then all goes on .
it allows the existence of the existence , and we can use the experience very smart .
prevention has to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s important .
and we start a <unk> technical program so we can use local people who can fix the equipment .
autism has a very large range , very massive -- the child doesn &apos;t develop language -- until we have brilliant scientists and engineers .
i love my film , like all my projects , and that &apos;s the weirdo in me .
now , what i learned early because i wasn &apos;t so much to sell my work and not myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment is different from a <unk> .
the movie in the film of dr is called .
i made a <unk> during the yard district . i built things and learned how to do tasks .
another very basic idea is that it &apos;s to make children from some of the many of the many of the many of the many of the most <unk> public services .
tg : i &apos;ve been passionate about that things i do , make the world better .
it &apos;s an extended reality that can follow projections and connect systems , or just a digital storyteller .
so the fifth time i stand on this shore , the <unk> i looked out on the far horizon and think again , i &apos;m going to make it , all the way over the long , dangerous wilderness of an ocean .
but it was going deeper : how much life is there ?
and then there &apos;s our main idea that you &apos;re not really saying how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but honestly , all these speeches are talking that i had had to do just to pass the <unk> , they were completely different .
thank you very much and much fun at the conference .
and this may be the <unk> , he lost his self-worth .
he joins the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so what happens when a medium suddenly comes a lot of new ideas into circulation ?
they quickly had to synchronize what other philosophers knew . otherwise couldn &apos;t lead the right kind of debate .
but there was a programmers who decided that that was not the best kind of work .
each of them can do changes , and they can do them for <unk> work , even if they knew nothing about the existence of each before .
this is called a &quot; <unk> &quot; , this thing here .
something that is a bit of a culture that can happen is that you can acquire a new learning system : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , right ?
don &apos;t try to do what others do , better better , because that doesn &apos;t make them very far .
and if you say somebody says you couldn &apos;t get it , you don &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months for the highest time .
but we &apos;ve tested these surfaces , before we put them out there -- or this rover -- and they made sure that everything works .
so we &apos;ve sent a spacecraft on the path to mars , called phoenix , this probe will land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so they can ask your watches .
and that would be bad .
we are in this while we &apos;re talking about here , to the next rover we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you have thought that these airbags are really cool things .
there were two <unk> that were interested in .
it &apos;s like the circulation on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water was frozen .
today i want to talk about how these exponential technologies are to understand .
so we see how exponentially growing food health care system .
this is an example of this <unk> .
there &apos;s wireless <unk> .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us better with our patients and take us more time to focus on the important , human elements of medicine that are expanding through this kind of technology .
but the current trends in medicine is , but exponentially smaller .
we come from genomics , when 10 years ago , was the first human <unk> was the cost about one billion dollars .
thanks to websites like me like me like me or the price of your data on <unk> or google health , it will always be more important , all these possibilities in a more cooperative way .
we used the cells from bone marrow to treat a patient with heart attack , we found a enhanced amount of energy , and higher <unk> , the use of its own <unk> cells , randomly adapted cells .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
her cats , god knows how many who climb on their <unk> , their <unk> , a <unk> .
like they cross the <unk> tiles , the stage , the street , <unk> , not looking at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid , a <unk> part of me would be out of control and i would always be stuck in the <unk> of her <unk> .
but i &apos;m afraid that <unk> comes from and my hand .
if we love us , she &apos;s holding me around me , i &apos;m there and not there .
we &apos;re looking for pictures that affect attention to critical topics , pictures of the most knowledgeable ones that are missing in the lives , pictures that make us really hack and do something in the other words : to act .
in &apos; 80s , the stigma was an enormous barrier to debate about this disease or mention it just to mention .
jonathan klein : photographs that changed the world .
i had been read a lot of books and studied and studied <unk> .
i could see the flag on the floor , well ... aah , a moment , and the music was going to a <unk> .
finally , the morning day day day , we got the <unk> , we put the helicopter -- two helicopters in the <unk> -- which was on the edge of the <unk> .
i knew that there were more open water water , and i had a <unk> .
i had known this , but i had expected to do this .
this was looking from my tent when i got this <unk> call .
and just from the air i saw the big picture .
and they were around and wanted to go back to shore , and all five died on the <unk> .
and this said a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .
but some days later we thought , we thought about this students , and we said , &quot; what would happen if this smartest guy couldn &apos;t have been in this state ?
one day in <unk> miles from the coast of <unk> , in one of the seven regions of the pacific , saw 20 american <unk> <unk> their ship in the ocean .
but in certain point , most of the people are learning to give up more , and become adults .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to get their fears closer to their fears .
right , fear is an amazing gift of imagination , a kind of <unk> in life , a way to look at a look at the future , if you &apos;re time to affect your appearance .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them into every living living room -- international , global , through our english canal .
they were separated from their people , from the masses and now we &apos;re going to collapse them , one after another .
thank you very much .
because we discovered that it &apos;s taking care of people , and people want to be informed -- they receive the <unk> through our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as 22 at the row , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s blood everywhere .
you want to share a needle exactly as little as you want to share a toothbrush , even with someone you &apos;re wearing .
so this is a overview of hundreds of studies of all the high animals of the <unk> in the united states , and these are studies that show that more effective , quite many of them .
so you can see these appalling pictures from africa .
i &apos;m saying , oh yeah , super , great .
ines is a solar system on the streets . it &apos;s a girl with tail .
she was 105 years old when i made this photograph of her .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little bit playing banjo . here &apos;s a little bit of a little bit .
we were on the car at <unk> , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mom was sitting in the car .
let &apos;s try it together with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
originally from the <unk> <unk> , which later they built the &quot; <unk> &quot; , an instrument with <unk> bodies and <unk> where the sound emerges .
well , that &apos;s easier said than done .
we weren &apos;t stupid : we put a piece of plywood in about five feet .
as a <unk> , came to me , why couldn &apos;t you take the oldest <unk> , the &quot; <unk> &quot; rhythms , and combine it with the latest technology ?
well , i think it works because scientists as a community connected through an ethic .
it &apos;s significant to show you the place in the room because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute idea of space that was for newton .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation was that it was somehow designed .
and you understand some things better than others , and so there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and give and give them that politics .
there &apos;s another tedster talking about two years ago , jonathan haidt that defined his work in three different levels .
and just let it go .
and five months of <unk> he was doing to experiment with a full approach .
this wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so forth .
or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers who played all there , they all had your own casa da musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit of a little bit .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s exactly as much as the identity of living living with the memory of the dead .
but the <unk> and the <unk> depiction of wealth is also the status of the deceased , and then they &apos;re the family on the deceased .
if we could extend our definition of death to isolate life , we could experience death as part of our lives and perhaps about death with something else as fear .
i wanted to end my show with a dance ...
your talk about the water in the water , and the context of correlation between darwinism and the fact that we &apos;re all naked , less <unk> , and we can make good swim .
ok , gordon , come on .
&quot; and now she has a <unk> . &quot;
eight years of u.s. history , eight minutes of my show , are just so far .
and jack nicholson says , &quot; because because because of all i want to be a better person . &quot;
&quot; make this world too better place if you can .
so i give you the message in advance : not <unk> .
where are the small ? &quot;
here &apos;s people over again .
as you can imagine , it &apos;s one thing , a <unk> , but if you go into a museum and says , &quot; it doesn &apos;t bother you , if i got your <unk> , or ? &quot;
and you could mean that there &apos;s one hint .
so we &apos;re <unk> and lots of lots and we found lots of small animals .
so we know now that torosaurus is actually a very selfish triceratops .
it looks like it &apos;s even bigger .
we wanted to make a atmospheric architecture .
all of water in the world are served here , so we thought that after you &apos;re on the water , moving through water and breathe water , you could drink the building .
the drill was mounted on a robotic arm .
then you get up there in this glass underneath the <unk> .
before and afterwards .
this is a guy from salt lake city . this is where they see there .
&quot; get &quot; drawn &quot; -- as if they were seduced seduced to make a <unk> .
she &apos;s not sure that this would be like this if the hadn &apos;t been a woman .
by the way , wired &apos;s &quot; has taken it .
analyze the news , they talk about if something lacks something like that did the people in new york times .
this particular plant filters filters out and other volatile chemicals out of the air .
m most of the time i need in morning when i &apos;m going to try to figure out what will happen .
and then again -- remember when you had a <unk> rice on an event , and criticized for this ?
pm : are you paying attention to the <unk> of your foreign policy ?
when i was secretary of state , only 13 women were foreign state state .
thank you that they were today .
malaria : there are eight countries in sub-saharan africa that could reduce 75 percent .
for example , for <unk> like us , this is a <unk> zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i &apos;ve been sexually aroused from this <unk> .
in order to be precisely , in your capital , some of you want to cut the severe time that cut your treasury and cut your life-saving devices like global fund .
in the contrary , it could save lots of lives .
if we take this metaphor of a genome as a program seriously , you think that chris anderson is an amazing thing , as as well as jim watson craig venter , and all of us .
you design something like a mobile phone , and in a very abstract language , you describe this mobile phone .
this is normal dna , what you &apos;re doing for normal dna .
we heat them up , add some salt , you heat almost to heat down and cool them down , and during the <unk> , the short strands of cells , the long strand is the long and it creates a structure .
so this works really well , and you can build patterns and also form , okay ?
you zoom in , there are only four strands of dna , and you &apos;re sitting on them , you can have some other tiles that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do .
we have a very automated program where small changes -- tiny , individual mutations -- something that created a square of a size , and make something bigger .
and they used to do it , and they have to understand that and get better understanding how feynman said , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we saw it before we saw three main systems : a world-class world world-class , which has completely separate <unk> and universal accessible for everybody with medical emergency , regardless of his financial devices .
in modern time , where you have a important thing , and the fight for survival hard , there are ordinary people who are blind people and pays their bribe just to come on .
in my last 18 months as a lawyer , fighting a kid , the <unk> , the case of india &apos;s largest business <unk> .
sm : well , the cost of <unk> were less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all the last four years that are around the world , new york to new zealand in the corner .
so , in a lot of content , we &apos;re going to do some things to make it easier .
so we use these <unk> to find unique talks , these things that are creating many different fields together , which is that they &apos;re essential for their subject , and those who really are really creative between the fields of mechanical fields .
no wonder that it comes up my colleagues because the truth is hard to digest .
the work of the computer theory could be as well as a hospital in a hospital .
ted is brilliance ubiquitous .
how do things happen ?
secondly , the most known nature of modern american primary education , <unk> , step for step .
and said , &quot; would you ready to have a <unk> in your community ? &quot;
a way that they don &apos;t get to do this . teach more ethics .
why ? because they &apos;re happy to do something that &apos;s right .
bill gates talked about the importance of education and in particular particular thing that makes kipp is power . &quot;
barry schwartz : makes a passionate call for practical wisdom as antidote to a society that has lost in the <unk> , and he argues that rules often help have failed , incentives thinkers and practical wisdom , everyday wisdom will help our world new .
&quot; by the way , dean , the arm has to fit a 50th percentile a <unk> , so a half inches from the little fingers , and it has to weigh less than four pounds .
then then then it takes another nine to make it practical and useful . &quot;
he makes what asked me darpa .
boys and girls , you &apos;ve been given enough .
it was amazing how positive they were all .
he wants to help . he told me that he wants to go back to help his mates .
how do we get out ?
it can make war like a tragedy or an farce .
ford moved out . she &apos;s got a leg , and then the other .
in london i lived 44 days in a wedding room with nothing .
and i &apos;ve got a <unk> . i &apos;m going to keep my breath again for a minute .
there are <unk> , where people are as deep as possible .
it &apos;s a <unk> tall and it &apos;s falling .
because of movement i wasted oxygen .
then his <unk> came his record and broke his record .
and there was no possibility to slow my heart rate down .
after 14 minutes i had these <unk> <unk> like this need to breathe .
as magician , i try to show people things that seem impossible .
congratulations . they &apos;ve completed the facility .
tamara , do you get this ?
even now , perhaps human <unk> may change the <unk> by the <unk> of his civilization .
in africa , people have 600 million birds and two million pounds meat meat .
first , even if all co2 emissions would stopped today , global warming would continue to be .
and then we saw an case on the east coast of the united states and it moved to more <unk> every year .
today there is another movement . the movement , saving earth .
<unk> <unk> of the fifth , whose image we see here , died .
i want to give you a kind of <unk> idea of what this change is like to do , which means that this change means : i want to explain to you what follows this change for us and our biodiversity , but also how much of this change impacts our culture .
and if it was only about this , this was really interesting .
so this salmon comes out there is that there &apos;s an genetically modified strategy camp that was from the corner of this animal interface and another <unk> , and so it &apos;s growing much faster with much less food .
these are actually intersections and no real animals .
we took its autonomy its autonomy . &quot;
in other words : this was the first creatures in the history of this world that had a computer as parent -- no organic parents .
paul <unk> : it &apos;s time to ask more critical critical .
if darwin would have nasa .
melanin , in its different forms , probably exists on earth for billions of years . it was always been over again and over again , as we did it as often .
and only in the last 5,000 years , rising by frequency and distance .
evolution helps us .
let &apos;s keep it .
so old and he &apos;s also his own , so it &apos;s very complicated and very simple -- and that &apos;s at the same time .
then you measure ... and measure ... and measure ...
i sort of set up <unk> , sort of , to enrich the things that actually had no geometry .
she took up in the time of <unk> to <unk> , an extraordinary period where mathematics was briefly about to visit this world .
<unk> measurements , big <unk> movements , ...
and this little bit of weird is what &apos;s going to be .
because this was one of my favorite books , because these islands were the same ones like the most interesting ones -- or less or less .
should you remove the breast ? should you get them ?
right ? it needs to be focused focused , it &apos;s particularly good .
anyone ? it &apos;s much harder .
this can happen in a medical environment .
and why not ?
a few months later , they goes back to the market when prices are highest , where they &apos;re called <unk> -- if food is scarce -- because they have to feed your family and no choice .
this leads too high .
almost three years ago , i decided to leave my freelance job as senior economist at the world bank , to return to my 14 years , after almost 30 years abroad .
we build a system that serves all the <unk> , integrity , efficiency and transparency creates , and the small farmers helps to solve the risks that i described .
we think that this initiative requires great political will , and we need to adapt the financial sector , and even the underlying legal framework .
my answer to this is a very depressing wall from bacteria <unk> sand that stretches through desert desert .
it &apos;s really threatened by the millions of people , especially in africa and china .
a problem with the plants of trees is that people in this region are so poor that they &apos;re trees to use trees as firewood .
and , after the cost of 60 dollars for the bacteria you never pay back , a meter of oil costs about 11 dollars .
in one time unprecedented growth growth and save the way that would be a bit of a bit .
the world shows me possibilities , and i picked out .
our goal is a resource of <unk> designs , so <unk> and fully that a single <unk> dvd is practically a <unk> dvd .
all these eggs , <unk> , bacteria , viruses can travel in 1 grams of human travel .
it &apos;s an amazing instrument to do .
maybe you think it &apos;s just good karma if these guys hold shit , but it &apos;s also profitable because they save a billion dollars every year .
and they found out there , they found that the family had no toilet .
at the pace , we will get the goal to provide people with sanitation , not reaching .
these reef in discovery bay , jamaica , were 20 years that were most developed coral reefs in the world .
he ate the slaves who were brought on the <unk> , the song called jamaica , &quot; <unk> rice , salt salt , they are <unk> , &quot; -- is a canvas for the meaning of the <unk> in the <unk> canada .
and we &apos;ve gotten this over the last 100 to 150 years .
i &apos;ve talked about millions of times about it , but it &apos;s incredible .
the other species of climate change is the <unk> of coral . it &apos;s a beautiful picture , isn &apos;t it ?
it doesn &apos;t sell .
and yet we are , according to our best , alone .
what i saw ? stars , satellites , <unk> planes -- typical <unk> .
and what would be behind these <unk> when it were ?
all i was just reroute because i was &quot; dune &quot; &quot; &quot; dune &quot; at all .
and it was so successful that it was even more inclusive .
<unk> is a vibrant small city , and to come up to the beach , they said to get a bus and then take a boat .
one of them was called joseph and he asked me what i did , and i explained .
and so we put in the trap .
companies are making goods from households -- that &apos;s us -- and provide income , and that &apos;s better better so we can spend more goods for more goods and performance .
the <unk> , <unk> , was under zero middle 2008 , shortly before the crisis .
you can hear the thoughts of five .
and at the same time , the solution is clear because they don &apos;t need to change human nature .
we need to do , actually , in the idea of a meaningful wealth , which offer the opportunities that people develop .
first , it &apos;s supposed to be more economist , so it could be more likely to be able to be something that you have to be a little bit of .
i painted it right on the man .
it was about space and light .
this photograph was taken when i visited <unk> bay in alaska 2002 to try to get the <unk> management service service to test their imaging system to see <unk> in ice .
another aspect is that it turns out it &apos;s spreading when it hits water .
and this is actually really <unk> .
and then , of course , was john d.
she was also reason for the national <unk> act , the clean air , the clean water .
they have <unk> in <unk> , in economics . they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they don &apos;t want to do what they do .
if you look at people who are spending dollars in the years , the two kids have have three jobs or more , and then they have to commute .
we &apos;ve got to find all the things like the <unk> , and you can find more about these politics .
the first person is certainly familiar .
here you &apos;re sitting in a penguin sitting in an afghan star club in &quot; afghan star &quot; &quot; and they said they would leave your friends about democracy will .
last year i was here , i talked about my swim at the north pole .
it feels like somebody standing behind you and you with a hammer all over your head .
and there we put us up there , and we got out , which was wrong there on mt . everest .
so , <unk> about this , talking about it , talking about it , and give a hundred percent , because there are only very , very few things that can &apos;t get achieved when we use our whole force .
this is a <unk> . it &apos;s a very simple computer .
can we get a kind of <unk> ?
so what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can create a <unk> structure -- b -- <unk> from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes of uv .
and if you &apos;ve seen amy smith , she talks about how to get students at mit to work with communities .
and it may be that all of us are aware of all the sensations of today &apos;s reality , and so connected , also the amount of problems that we need to solve .
we &apos;re increasingly aware that we don &apos;t even need to get into the entire <unk> problem .
okay . i also got one .
can we connect us again with natural ecosystems around us by giving them more integrated and more integrated and these ?
as you can see , the death death death death death death death death rate per year in the 1950s , to 2,000 deaths per conflict per conflict per year , so terrible that .
because we did something right , and it would be really good to figure out what it is .
they want to do the <unk> .
if not , one of the two are going to be updated , isn &apos;t it ?
the developing world used soap and water , immunization .
and now i &apos;ve got this <unk> on this axis .
and you remember the beginning of the last century , it was very bad . until this so-called big leap forward .
see how it grows ? and how hundreds of millions and billions of people out poverty ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they &apos;re eating malaria .
and we need to take the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t all do africa . don &apos;t get a difference in it .
it &apos;s not durable . and it &apos;s not going to happen to a superpower superpower .
and many of you have heard the phrase &quot; memes &quot; : the evolution of technology is something i &apos;ve got lots of attention , so you know , one of the first objects you had had was a little bit of <unk> .
my argument is basically that , well , <unk> , <unk> , was always part of our life .
and this is quite new , and i think it &apos;s even worse than -- this possibility -- because of developments in information information , in <unk> that can be used as weapons , like biotechnology or nanotechnology .
i &apos;m doing my best , okay .
&quot; <unk> is our <unk> &quot; means &quot; he has saved the people , &quot; which was quite sophisticated <unk> .
we only have in six countries , which means that media report only about six countries .
so , we should put our money inside ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s greenest nation botswana , has ever used its ratio .
during this development we were , africans , the edge of development , orientation and implementing politics in our countries .
it &apos;s mostly inaccurate , it costs billions .
we would like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases of treatable , two of them even more .
so in the last 10 years , and as hope for the future we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what makes life worthwhile .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them different because they &apos;re in different interventions , it &apos;s possible that we have one instead of the other -- three different lives .
but it showed that there was no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t look like <unk> <unk> .
and what you find out is that if you do something funny , that &apos;s a <unk> .
when i was convicted , i thought if i was good enough to make somebody depressed , not afraid i would make him happy .
a polar polar bear that swims in the arctic , recorded by paul <unk> .
but these so-called dwarf &quot; emerges if all parts sit together and not just the event , but my emotional connection comes from .
nick -- again with a automatic camera -- has taken thousands of photographs of this .
sometimes you can tell a more violent history in focused .
we want to find solutions .
and then all of all go and jump .
thank you .
and what &apos;s more important , because this is a very selfish process that you can capture in only three seconds : we can capture emily in a period of less than one afternoon in several different kinds of disciplines and <unk> .
emily : image metrics is a <unk> , <unk> .
i was found in it .
there &apos;s also some beautiful primates .
but i was from the west and working in the east .
all all all all all the time were mined , animals were killed , forest forest , forest and so on .
here coltan is mined , and gold .
we came to the <unk> day .
the elephant just simply and they took the <unk> .
i don &apos;t think somebody can accuse google because google makes the right thing , even if people use google like al qaeda .
<unk> <unk> -- a hero of congo
we &apos;ve got almost without having noticed , from a economy to a market economy .
they don &apos;t need to pay it from your budget .
i should be told you what happened with these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need perfect equality , but it needs citizens who share a common lives .
stay in 1900 as foremost nation in 1900 , where the line moves into red .
we &apos;ve got this gift into the 70s and &apos; 80s , when women went into the school .
electricity was also helping the emancipation of women .
an amazing fact for the key is that in the first half of the 20th century , life expectancy has gone up three times as quickly as in the second half of the 19th century .
this was the article that i was writing at 11 years for 11 years .
i &apos;ve got some who had long : between five and 15 should be my <unk> and that led to a sense of failure .
so if i look at creativity , i think , it &apos;s also a sense or the <unk> of the interconnectedness that i see between virtually everything in life .
this is what buddhist fishermen say because they don &apos;t really kill living creatures .
and they &apos;ll find it more often .
and i had to find what was happening to history .
how are we going to do what the responsibility and the causes of the is beyond one court ?
and they need to be in all possibilities , including those who i never looked at before .
i hope you see me , if i &apos;m going to do these examples , because i &apos;m talking about anything you could spend time about it .
now there &apos;s newsprint magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have together is that they don &apos;t have together .
the edges of the focus on the middle , which is the big market .
these guys are putting the <unk> <unk> in the world .
but you don &apos;t need to be more inclusive -- you don &apos;t need to be fully <unk> .
so what you need to do is figure out who it &apos;s interested .
nine months later , i got messages on tahrir square , because it was a painting i saw in my favorite book .
thank you .
mostly , the cultural heritage tends to look look at and go back and to the past .
my first report for national geographic , i realized that you &apos;ve got environmental issues in a story about nature , i had devoted to <unk> .
these are the lions and tigers of ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m obsessed with you -- i wanted to do a different , more positive history of sharks to talk about the need for sharks .
after i had left out of the life , i found that this habitat is going to be able to create a new model .
they also caught in <unk> .
but when the fish came back and then back urchins and the population , they grew forest , grew forest in flat water .
it &apos;s now living in the jungle in the jungle &apos;s jungle , and this is <unk> , your second son , by the way , the son of the second existence i &apos;ve saved .
it was an biological desert .
then you see the returns and starts to measure what comes out .
so how did we break this circulation ?
and you need bacteria to bind your nitrogen , and without these microbes , there &apos;s no achievement .
humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can change climate change .
in <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the law to protect the own system .
the <unk> eddies that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to show you another .
early days , <unk> <unk> creates <unk> sculptures , beautiful works that are moving in the patterns of falling or moving down the blue , and in nine minutes , he &apos;s going to be inspired by his art company -- also inspired by math and nature .
every city has their own design .
23 years later , they asked us and this idea of <unk> .
this is the italian portal , the <unk> park , the <unk> park , the japanese park , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or anything , but no one , but no matter of science .
people always say that consciousness was hard to define .
you cannot doubt about your own conscious sense .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to make consciousness , we have to find just the right program .
we constantly bring the objectivity and subjectivity as nature of reality and as qualities of standards .
don &apos;t you find ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , love , and they couldn &apos;t imagine to make something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear a <unk> .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , don &apos;t it .
i couldn &apos;t get this thing to work , whatever i want or how much i &apos;m going to do .
but we need to change from an industrial model to a solar system where every single school can flourish .
so suppose and i wanted to find more about it .
and the reason this is that the historical report is digitized in interstellar pace .
there was a light on her . she said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s seriously .
she led a group of students in protest in the streets .
i was standing , i got a tea , sat around me and i &apos;m here -- still almost paralyzed , but here .
and peace directly adds up with you the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the dictatorship to democracy , &quot; with <unk> habit of resistance .
it &apos;s not such a thing that &apos;s not like this .
indeed , chris was worried , and said , &quot; look , show you this photograph , you will think you will think you &apos;re still one of these crazy modern artists that don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the spirit .
and the solution i &apos;m aiming at is to the biggest culprits in this massive <unk> of earth in this massive <unk> of earth and the following of the biosphere destruction of the biosphere .
so i asked , &quot; what would be called t from the counter -- let &apos;s call it out where they enhance the impacts , into the denominator -- let &apos;s do it where they &apos;re going to do the effects ? &quot;
and he was a strong <unk> of the marketplace that has increased our sales and profits .
we literally won the <unk> .
but five days later , back to atlanta , i received an email from photographed thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so frankly , a lot of us who are working on the industry , that the industry is threatened by technology and possibly more <unk> .
and truly , we need somebody to communicate with us so we have a experience with a mentally divine ?
the arts , whatever they do , hold every time they &apos;re going to take us to look at our relationship with a curiosity and curiosity .
three sisters ahn has a <unk> music with her passionate new life , at tedwomen , she starts with the happy and <unk> &quot; david <unk> , &quot; and then you play a <unk> , <unk> version of <unk> <unk> .
the manchester craftsmen is named after my quarter .
he makes a bunch of money through what &apos;s called special furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken over the curriculum of american <unk> , which is harvard in the harvard of the <unk> , and we &apos;ve got a <unk> for mothers in the middle of the inner city .
we &apos;ve noticed that you have to flowers and eat sunlight and expectations and herbie &apos;s music and so you can heal the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given up from the world , flying from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of doing , and affection and sunlight and good music and good music .
and it has worked quite well .
and i will allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and you should ever decide to sell you an agreement that was going to be used for school to support school . &quot;
this is a room for nancy wilson who was taken her album in our school last last christmas morning .
the brown building , is you &apos;ve looked at you and i &apos;ll tell you where i was doing my greatest mistake .
he came to me after it . he said , &quot; man , this is a marvelous story .
and so he has a group of people .
bill <unk> shares a quiet and amazing history of salvation through art , music and unusual alliance .
and then the transducer takes the <unk> to the brain to the brain , and the outcome is a <unk> that produced a normal diagnostic system .
but there was the <unk> factor , the problem with the code , and how you could make cells better answers to make normal reactions , and so that was our contribution .
it cover us with a invisible <unk> that &apos;s <unk> in the environment , so we stay healthy .
but if the bacteria grow and expand and all together and participate all together , then they &apos;re going to increase the numbers beyond the cell directly from the cell .
now we know that all bacteria can speak each other .
this is just a photograph -- a <unk> of your skin .
bacteria has become incredibly <unk> , which is beyond that we kill bacteria .
fact , there is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they meet tasks that they never could be able to be able to do if they were just a individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor for me to come to this conference .
or the first ones come into the room .
but if we think about justice , aristotle says that what we need to think is is the actual nature of the most fragile activity and qualities that are worth them , admire and recognizes them .
what for a reason you would ?
charlie , what do you say ?
here &apos;s how he &apos;s going to do it .
so aristotle has aristotle &apos;s , <unk> and the fierce question of same-sex marriage is right .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic arguments
many people said , &quot; well , you know , they don &apos;t have to say us , they don &apos;t have to say we &apos;re going to start to say , we should start with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity may be able to make a decision .
if that &apos;s what does this mean for us ?
i &apos;m saying that the speed of the good enough .
i &apos;m saying this is nonsense .
we know that there &apos;s this threshold because we don &apos;t get any vietnamese grievances before we get a old age , and even though the damage has been before our birth .
that means you have to make your homework to understand whether this is true .
audience : hi . i &apos;ve read somewhere that over the last 20 years , average lifespan has been its average lifespan of virtually every one on the planet .
not one of their media has gotten to .
we don &apos;t care how we do our gain .
they went into the center of <unk> and put on the agenda .
but i can &apos;t have a real time to the <unk> , the argument that i &apos;ve learned about economics , epidemiologists and <unk> .
the <unk> is slightly creepy , and probably you know a part of the <unk> .
fourteen americans die per day , three times as the 90s , and almost everything comes from <unk> .
he apparently had sense of humor .
politicians and <unk> are afraid to market <unk> as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
secondly , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; we &apos;re trying . &quot;
there you find some amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;re going to go . &quot; and paid people for all the time they saw .
he may think he would have ever born the baby baby , so he might need some help from the outside .
i asked peter kong had changed , and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
we want to talk about africa : the next chapter &quot; and this is : a healthy , <unk> , beautiful africans .
but most importantly , they need to be productive in their lives , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that things can be done .
we can we connect this all ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to crawl between my legs through my back to my sister &apos;s my back to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything good .
and often i don &apos;t see african collaborators .
the question is how we use them from all this good will that comes to us ?
you are <unk> . &quot;
we &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective in a product of a product , i took this proposition to so we can study them , just like we can study any other complex neurological process .
the method has been applied since the 90s to investigate extremely complex processes .
i want to try to show this for you briefly .
and then i &apos;m in the room control , here , games .
how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that has a massive brain activity that is involved in .
i want to say that we say that probabilities and statistics is the mathematics of games and <unk> .
this is very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not comfortable .
but keep the thoughts for the whole time of eight seconds .
and playing and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can be used and intuitively used to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they &apos;ve been running very quickly , and without a stable electric grid that doesn &apos;t happen , so children die .
another point of esther was that we react when it comes to a tragedy as haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s produced by the <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting thing that &apos;s called .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in your transportation system , a very cheap blue laser .
audience : yeah .
interesting is , although we &apos;ve got them all the time , we &apos;ve never managed to get the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant at thomas house .
this protocell sensor that you see here is actually growing in a <unk> which was constructed from outside and <unk> .
so , water is a critical issue .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; is still .
the idea is not yet sophisticated .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touched the water , you should hear how air comes out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked us : if this is the smallest genome of a self-replicating species , could it even be a smaller genome from this ?
we also realized that we were , once this worked , a real chance would have if we could bring the synthetic chromosome to the bacteria .
so care is <unk> .
finally finally , the final quote is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , i can &apos;t understand it . &quot;
but actually , we live here in northwest , very close to the actual idea of the koran from paradise that was called armrests times as &quot; garden , called <unk> by running jets . &quot;
but the more you add , the more seems to be lost .
and these numbers 72 has never happened .
this is a nest of a tire colony , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony that has been established by a queen in previous summer .
the <unk> -- this is what we &apos;re going to show a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group . they go back early morning before the first group goes up .
oddly , interestingly , interestingly , it looks like half the ant ant ant &apos;s ant ant &apos;s doing nothing .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the <unk> and bring them up to the <unk> side of the <unk> and put them there .
but the foragers choose to get out of it .
and we did experiments that show that the longer an ant emerges out , and the more easy to change on their surface , and so that ants smell different ways that they do different things that they do different work .
they cover all the earth except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all this is about 89 million barrels oil , and the annual costs are three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
so that has nothing to do with this .
i thought about thinking where we can use gas gas gas .
and when i got to the <unk> cost of oil gas gas .
why does it make you worry ?
so just 500 million has been wiped out .
it was never covered underneath groundwater or something like that .
tbp : i lost 150 million wind on the wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there were <unk> . and there were <unk> .
so , life &apos;s life is an event . they &apos;re happy it .
these are working in madurai manhattan , where you built with the first <unk> building .
there were in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing without the light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story : they didn &apos;t only have to wait and wait , but then the <unk> , when they were there , the third time , they had to call somebody .
so i &apos;m going to use a more clinical language , and maybe you &apos;re not going to use your heart as warm as about compassion .
and here &apos;s basic idea that <unk> has made good acts for people who are going to be able to be .
basically , it &apos;s about if you &apos;re my enemy or my favorite , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m going to do much less to apply the golden rule on them . okay .
so , the results are going on . this is a zero-sum game .
each form of interdependence , <unk> , force one , humanity &apos;s humanity .
and you &apos;ll explain you , other thinking that america don &apos;t respects them and even dominate it , and they hate america .
most diseases relate to poverty , but in the case of cancer , the children who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a kid died a kid , but nothing changed .
because you don &apos;t get this kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness isn &apos;t the end .
now , the dominant hadron collider would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell and that this is a <unk> .
what does this mean ?
we found some kind of material material that included the extracellular matrix , we put the cells inside and lo and behold , within about four days , they were going to have <unk> and right , you see what we &apos;ve created in a culture .
and of course we ask us where we go ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we &apos;ve got a <unk> journalists that caught in the <unk> , a young boy whose book has made so many <unk> quotes that you took it out of the shelves ; a <unk> about fake ultrasound in new york times .
it sounds like a weird book , but it &apos;s actually about new ways of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you made four good friends of a person whose personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lying ; they used to be talked and then they were on .
they told how big the bath was , or said , the <unk> were like that and so far from the hotel .
woman &apos;s 2 : right there . okay , glass , take a photograph !
and then you want to be able to get your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes as often i &apos;ve got away from life for emails , social networks and so on , although there was nothing really important or more .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful ligament .
and everybody who was going to go back , i was going .
at least for me , because if i always do the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring , i &apos;m very quickly . i &apos;m very quickly .
i look like -- i don &apos;t know when i see myself .
are you going nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry ? you look so cute .
anyway , i don &apos;t say that it &apos;s good , but just that it doesn &apos;t be <unk> , ok ?
if you have the speed of the treatment too long , it will be buttermilk .
i call it the era of citizenship -- what people are different different circles or ethnic circles , but yet as citizens can be equal to citizens .
in egypt , i was ultimately discovered by this .
this had studied in london , was trained in yemen and climbed an airplane to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are using democratic culture on the ground .
as anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , it &apos;s a good family of the richest families .
what happened there was a political coalition that was a political coalition for a political set , and this was to get the leaders .
these tools are only very interesting when they &apos;re going to be very technical .
he &apos;s <unk> the limitations of individual networks and then they put them .
and because of social communities abroad , chinese students were studying abroad , or companies from the rest of the world had given the offices in china , there were people around the world who were hearing these news .
and finally , the chinese attacked .
we are always more in a media media media media globally , socially , ubiquitous and cheap .
but everything in the <unk> , i &apos;m always going to vote on as i was looking at it .
so my fourth night , climb everest , khrushchev moved over the mountain .
this look is the <unk> line , the first 2,000 feet of the base of base camp .
and this is in camp fourth fourth twins .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck weathers , another climbers in this storm collapsed collapsed and died .
it &apos;s so focused on working on top , i sometimes syringes were able to get stuck through the clothing .
these climbers was <unk> .
and i can only get out of how he did this .
and so he &apos;s going to push back into action .
these are sherpas who light up the <unk> .
and the fourth thing that is extremely significant for me , &quot; ideas that we need to share . &quot;
but today , 60 years , through social ascent , entrepreneurs were also been models , and they &apos;re both very strong for society .
it was well-meaning people who wanted to introduce democracy because they &apos;re bringing ideas to the universal <unk> , parliament and constitution and so on .
the third thing is again .
the second is the most promising ones that we have that we have as difficult to create cooperative jobs in companies that 93 percent of indian jobs are in the state of civic jobs .
so if you &apos;re a young country , you &apos;ve got a chance to bring a modern engineering opportunity , so you don &apos;t have the <unk> , if you get older .
you have to say clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to let the government decides to vote .
although some people on the left didn &apos;t like to hear it was the revolution of the markets that are used to be , &quot; the government has no idea . &quot;
they don &apos;t fear the masses .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the <unk> and those they represent .
<unk> .
each of this vascular system would be statistically thrown away , two years after the <unk> .
david cameron invested 20 million pounds into a social clinical group fund to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : investment in social change
i &apos;m working . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the <unk> ?
even if i &apos;m my friend named jack there , i say , &quot; i &apos;m sleeping for you , jack . <unk> , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t found it , my name is tom thum , and i &apos;m a <unk> . that means i &apos;ve just heard anything you just heard , just and just with my voice just with my voice .
and finally , with this one thing here , i can make my sound , <unk> , repeat .
our people had had to try about 5,000 different types of research to find the right ones .
don &apos;t listen to those who say you can &apos;t do . everybody can do this .
on the right is a <unk> .
and i &apos;ll give you some examples .
you see the blue <unk> skull .
his wife said it was &quot; happiest day in her life . &quot;
many kinds of patients are looking at the <unk> .
the results are better than the surgical .
he can stop the surgery anytime and stop .
<unk> street , i know .
and that &apos;s where they really get much their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s an industry that runs both directions .
and so they want to move to the next trend and so quickly as possible .
and their jokes , like the <unk> of a <unk> , really work within this aesthetic .
you need many lawyers and lots of time in court , and the merchants decided that that was much too expensive .
these are both binary behaviors in the logic of the brain .
and i want to thank you about this point of <unk> <unk> , that she has made this very <unk> presentation .
once i took me to a crowded set , and i realized that the <unk> i should meet , not <unk> .
i think this is one of the most important and more powerful things on the planet .
there &apos;s lots of ancient <unk> in the u.k. everywhere , if you do , you &apos;ll note that the <unk> of the churches were there .
here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> years old .
i hope i think i think these organisms , i can help make attention on their remarkable sense , and make my part of their own longevity in the near future .
let &apos;s ask it on something else .
20 years later , criminals are using mobile phones , but they also create their own <unk> , like this that &apos;s used by the <unk> of mexico in all 31 states .
what did you do ?
what could terrorists do today , using now available technology ?
recently , the fbi has arrested a u.s. company in america that would be these <unk> drones to transport <unk> in america in america .
as we see here , we turn us into cyborgs .
now , there &apos;s six percent percent than you caught it , but it &apos;s hard .
there are so many people killed that the only single <unk> in the <unk> , not as much as this is possible in the outside of <unk> juarez .
but on the other hand , i hear people who talk about fear , some aversion of risk .
and tragically she was been in 1996 when they were working in colombia with the goal of teaching her culture and language , with two other colleagues of the farc who trafficked and killed and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more susceptible to this kind of manipulation than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people to look for simple solutions , mild categories because we don &apos;t look at profit as an instrument .
but all of the community , all different different bodies , also the <unk> and <unk> , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because the <unk> when she says full of juice , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , it &apos;s the world , it &apos;s enough to heaven . &quot;
but no faces ?
okay , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make a little joy of my wife .
why i don &apos;t know how to do my wife ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because one company does power from cotton and it works .
<unk> : i see this thing in my wife , &quot; why do you get such a awful rag rag candy ? &quot;
now there can 110 countries in this . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was there over the last seven years .
then i did a huge amount of training , i swam into the <unk> and forth .
it was actually happening that cells actually did in my fingers and <unk> it .
and my good friend david saw how i thought , and he came up and said , &quot; lewis , i know you for 18 years .
the prospect that they could die in 30 , 40 years , a very <unk> .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion liters of oil on earth today that can be inferred and nurtured .
now , this could be the end of the story -- okay , we just replace this with conventional , renewables , but i think that &apos;s even more on this story .
but special material that the abalone creates , millions of abalone , all day every day , every day .
and the idea behind it was basically that i &apos;m the brush in the hand of great personalities that come from and i would interview .
but i wanted interviews , who are different .
actually , my first was introduced george abbott who was 97 years old , and abbott was full force force -- i think you can define it .
we know the big <unk> , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to share , and the meaning of the thing is not ludicrous .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t this <unk> , but it was a <unk> for my interview .
he said , &quot; but i understand this . i can understand this . &quot;
half of the body was weakened , the other ones not .
this is a <unk> in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to make beautiful things .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s not the paintings that we had painted , but what we actually painted .
another example : again , stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million dollars on the swiss <unk> , on the <unk> of the president , the senior clerks of the president , the senior clerks of state .
they actually applaud that .
most of the big companies are convinced that they have to use very strict policies against bribery and so on .
if you want to go into a restaurant if you look at the menu menu , then you expect you to order all of you on the map ?
and this was the first time i thought that expression reflects on her face , what she &apos;s holding from him .
well , he shares his life .
this french painter painter painter painter was known for his life , but occasionally people did .
unfortunately , these are now spends all of the time with a bunch of other orphans in the archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i had dinner with a dinner party that gave us a father for us .
&quot; i congratulate you to your round wedding , james .
my father lived most of his <unk> in africa .
i would like to show you six minutes .
<unk> <unk> : but our films , they are stories that we can identify with .
so it really makes a young man out there to really what can bring it to think about certain negative things and all this or any <unk> behavior .
franco <unk> : so much to say , so little time .
i think this is really the subject of this event .
franco , you &apos;ve described this as an operational movie industry industry .
it &apos;s basically a cd . it &apos;s a cd .
now art art art : oh , this was fantastic .
this was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even if they &apos;re completely <unk> .
we show &quot; portal , &quot; because you &apos;re shooting on walls to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most important , behavior .
i had to drop some bridges behind me .
everything refers to the <unk> and students who were first meeting to say that they will denied a place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and gnarly things i normally drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i ever did .
this beautiful object , the swiss army army , for me to be a participation .
and one day i had one -- oh , vice versa .
i &apos;ve got the <unk> and the copper , so it &apos;s a very thin way to do it .
and this is my cafeteria .
and it remembered why i &apos;m doing this stuff like my house as well as my house .
she never had completed .
the dome was a wish of the <unk> .
it was an attempt , this narrow piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 at 76 feet -- in an splendor , moving these areas and separated that space and dining dining table in this pavilion .
they call the plan of <unk> .
here &apos;s it .
from the building in the background , it seems like a <unk> iceberg in the mountains .
our clients don &apos;t want to work , so -- and when we met our new acoustician , he said that this or that was the right form .
in barcelona i was asked to make a fish , we &apos;re working on it , at the base of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
can we not make clean burning <unk> ?
and one of the things they found was that they didn &apos;t get .
and these are our most sophisticated briquettes .
and he has the problem of the health effects of wood wood and coal .
it &apos;s a place where you would be when this was india , in this room just three of us had a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts as in the united states to move things .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after surgery , everything .
now , this isn &apos;t surprising . but we asked them to judge their honesty and intelligence , kindness and <unk> .
he had married . he had a son called <unk> .
is this business with our outward and our employment with this kind of selfish phenomenon ?
i want to tell a little bit of the surgery that we &apos;re doing , how far we are and where we want to do .
we can replace underneath underneath the structure of oil , but we &apos;re not very far with replacing by <unk> .
my theme is food in schools because here &apos;s social justice .
and the next thing is <unk> .
people are always talking about sustainability . but we should find out what that &apos;s at all .
you know that all you think you should always be more and more ?
and they then got <unk> , hey , we can sell this stuff to children .
and this is a typical <unk> system .
the things that we might do at home , and for so important , we need to teach children in schools .
we need to educate the staff .
these eight billion of these eight billion and 49 cents -- so much money is ready for lunch for lunch .
as a little girl sitting my grandfather out of a hot child with me outside the sun .
if i go to a party , and people ask me what i &apos;m doing , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor &quot; , &quot; i &apos;m a professor &apos; eyes .
i want to get your favorite to know everything about their most positive creatures , undermining -- that they are really a professional conscious conscious .
don &apos;t break the tension . i want to be more intentional .
it &apos;s a documentary in <unk> about consciousness .
when i came closer , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
how do you know that it was what they did ?
do you see it ? who of you don &apos;t see it ? that &apos;s helping .
we &apos;re starting to get a few examples .
today tomorrow morning jeff hawkins has described his efforts to bring a good to bring big theory into neuroscience .
and the <unk> in london said , &quot; what i &apos;m saying is &quot; who &apos;s charge in london -- &quot; i mean , no one is charge . &quot;
now , congestion congestion were introduced on the third january 2006 , and the first image , here &apos;s a painting of stockholm , a typical street on a second .
so we did this enormous survey with lots of <unk> and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went 20 years of <unk> -- from eastern europe -- through the mountains of the caucasus , central africa , east africa , russia .
what do we know from the <unk> of the taliban who are going to be <unk> to the kids of the people like in schools like in <unk> ?
the world changed .
i was my office , my desk was tidied up , i had the blue <unk> on the walls .
and there were even two of them .
there was really what .
how amazing is this ?
i want to talk about some other patients that all of you do in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized that the page of google earth remembered where we can fly to each address .
we are , they are most essential resource in health .
<unk> from sea is a <unk> .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , or ?
they don &apos;t take your environment with sound sound . i &apos;m talking about the <unk> .
in america alone in america alone , the annual costs would be to pay for 22 billion dollars , so we can get us in denial of wealth .
why should we care about aging ?
if you go out and look at the night sky and look at this beautiful , flying animal , i wish that they smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be tested in economic development .
the electricity booms don &apos;t supply up with electricity production , but many countries of the bottom billion .
so what does it go wrong ? why are it called &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
and so the countries of the bottom billion are a very enterprising politics .
some economists came back in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to reveal a auction ? it &apos;s going to reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , there are a billion people sitting in poor or low-income countries , how can we help them ? economist paul collier demonstrates a bold , compassionate plan that we can close to the gap between poor and rich .
we don &apos;t have boxes where they &apos;re produced .
here he gives a english hero in africa in africa that we need to do it for just possible treatment .
so we &apos;ve got this : imagine , imagine , they thought , and i could talk to the people in their native language .
&quot; basics of the <unk> surgery .
14 years ago , i found this ordinary material , <unk> , that was used for centuries .
he asks me whether i could build this as a <unk> piece for the city .
so we were experimenting with small <unk> tissue to create an water that &apos;s molded by wind , and when we test it turns out that it can be molded by people that interact with them and move through it , and move through .
they were in their homes in the grass , watching themselves modified patterns of the <unk> of the people who didn &apos;t know them , and shared the <unk> of miracles .
so i realized that this is an enormous risk for our society .
if peter moves his arm , this yellow spot is where you see there that &apos;s shown in the activity of the activity in the <unk> .
if you do this , what are you going to control ?
and to say that such changes are beyond death itself is an claim about a fact that can be true or wrong .
now let me ask me clear , i don &apos;t say that science is going to be this room or we can have scientific answers to every moral question .
now why would this undermine an objective morality ?
how high is the probability that this is a peak of human development ?
on the left-hand side you see edward <unk> .
we live in a world full of <unk> technologies and these technologies can &apos;t be able to be able to break it up as they &apos;re doing together .
but then we need to talk again about well-being in a wider context .
and what is his natural enemy , what is the tools of the good beetle that we talk about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , no <unk> it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> wasp &apos;s cap , two millimeter long , slim , a quick and <unk> .
and if we put these good <unk> for example in a village hall , they go to the flowers .
in israel , for example , where we &apos;re on 1,000 acres -- this is equivalent to 10,000 israeli <unk> -- biological <unk> in <unk> , 75 percent of the pesticides saved .
third , to raise awareness of the ability to improve this capability .
<unk> is one of my favorite books .
it &apos;s fun to make fun of the rich enough than about otherwise else . i do that often .
urban health -- -- that &apos;s what new yorkers needs .
her <unk> name was <unk> <unk> , and so this -- i was not enough enough to say &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or also , the soviet union only found some decades , maybe within a decade , after the time , the soviet union was most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent outside that really eat insects .
they are at the beginning of the <unk> .
why do we actually do these balls into the soup , it &apos;s still meat in anyway ?
it &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
so we &apos;re going to decide for one , or to five kilograms of revenue .
we can increase them a bit of the cost of rainforests , but it will be going to be a limitation of an limitation .
and you may think , well they &apos;re not available .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun , or ?
he said , &quot; ah , we have to put it on the table .
and i &apos;ve seen a sign .
even if canadians were doing the system , they do it in a wise nature of society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a <unk> . and on the back , there are some different ones , <unk> , and scales to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , this device is used .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and precision that &apos;s just amazing and remarkable .
so , the first robot i want to talk about is strider .
this is only being used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s 80 feet of the big , you can use out of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
for example : in this case , although the left and the right wheel is connected to one single axle and so quickly spinning , so quickly .
welcome to <unk> , the robot , <unk> technology lab . &quot;
but the cool thing is the <unk> .
once it does . this was our first trial , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but just not enough to talk about a spark of imagination .
so this kind of education is very important .
<unk> that are going to be <unk> .
there are basically no pools of good teachers , and only eight percent of the county , they have a <unk> or a degree degree .
there is a total empty empty about creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all cell cells sitting on tires , then they won this team .
but for last few decades , but much money that was meant for class class was completely gone .
and go outside and get neighbors who get them and where they buy and why , is a homework .
in this is not impossible , creating large barren surfaces .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of the <unk> and explore .
after four months of rainy season , it &apos;s a year , and now it &apos;s eight months dry season .
here &apos;s some results .
this global act is going on climate change in the same extent , as we do fossil fuels , maybe even more than these .
when i learned about these two things , i was very excited to get my personal reasons for some scientific reasons .
it has a very good <unk> <unk> , which was partly about the ronald artillery of all the imported africa .
after treatment , we let the child a row of simple <unk> to see how his vision fits .
and the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to argue long with my wife .
we &apos;re tracking these <unk> and hopefully hopefully more results .
and then i &apos;ve got from this <unk> for physically disabled stories of <unk> and i thought , oh i don &apos;t know , but before i conviction it , i &apos;m looking at how this is .
but this was in latin &apos; 95 and then when the winter was told , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then there &apos;s aimee made in 1996 , and she &apos;s excited . your family travel -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried everybody i could be told for whoever on against who , against who are i performing here ?
i &apos;ve always won all , and now i thought , what ?
you can be a big child . take it off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and designers are going to be 2 , and we &apos;re going to talk about design .
they got somebody who came over and the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to see the actual losses of economics , because we use copyright math .
or the 75,000 jobs .
and again , something about mathematics : math is sometimes like mathematics -- like this example -- and sometimes they don &apos;t do it -- how &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math math , we use about 80 percent of time to teach people how to take three of them .
if people ask me : true ?
but robots that we allowed to separate these things , so this is something else than building a car and learning its learning .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both these together .
and one of the reasons that is so important -- so , it &apos;s very important to take computers into the exams .
it was winters in 2009 , and i was blind for about one year .
i thought about my father , who passed away from complications of an surgical hospital .
similarly , as you &apos;re just through the grip of the ground , the changing texture of the ground , and over time , it makes a idea of where you are and what you &apos;re going to do .
but when i was <unk> and walking down broadway , i was blessed at every corner .
if you design a city in mind in mind , there are many , many jobs .
to give you a feeling for this experience , &quot; i think &quot; i think you &apos;re every every every time . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous ones i knew -- the 10 commandments , love your next , be fertile and <unk> ...
you give money for a good purpose and designed for emotional management for the purpose .
she &apos;s not book written by the sky .
so , this is actually the key thing to me , really happiness , remember that there &apos;s not a car that doesn &apos;t get away from the car , and i didn &apos;t go up on the direction on the stairs .
this was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to make any meaning of any meaning , we really need to do it on it and rings with it .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics who did this work thought was to <unk> , so we developed <unk> applications like this <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of a <unk> of a laser interface on a laser .
alex was working on a small , slightly obscure , independent <unk> called &quot; minority report &quot; for steven <unk> , and invited us to develop the interface that &apos;s supposed to be used in the film .
we &apos;re leading this <unk> surgery because we may like yellow and <unk> on green <unk> .
let &apos;s pull that apart : i &apos;m teaching it in <unk> .
we , as humans , are the ones that make things , and we should ensure that our machines are helping us and build on it .
john , thank you that this fiction fiction .
what okolloh did was couldn &apos;t have been possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are shown by this black line , said , &quot; we change this deal with this deal .
they are created by the members of the community .
and like all good <unk> , it makes a leap of 20 years when the interest &apos;s interest .
you &apos;ve got five days available , and so change came on change and we started playing <unk> .
but india didn &apos;t want to play with the <unk> game .
another was called cricket .
was that new india ? this was another world where you could get gamers from everywhere long as you get the best player for the best price .
we &apos;ve all seen games in calcutta , but something like we had never seen . <unk> khan brought the audience with a <unk> song for <unk> -- for biting , not for india , not for india , but for severe .
could you imagine that day would come ?
hopefully i i &apos;ve made any of them about a experience of richer and hopefully more expensive and hopefully , there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the most likely dogs is because they &apos;re very quickly in memory , how often they &apos;ve seen dogs and pigs on the leash .
why about anything in earth should anyone play dravidian ?
on the other side , if you visit a developing country , and you can buy 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend your $ 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i give them an example .
and if the path to the other end of the city &apos;s 100 mice , it &apos;s worth 100 mice , perfectly whatsoever , whatever you are saving . but people don &apos;t think that .
now , in large and all you &apos;re enormous impatient .
watch what happens when we skip out of the <unk> .
dan , i would like to hear more . you say that our answer is to terrorism , i mean that he &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no guns .
and so some people are looking at economists as stupid people .
subject and variation is one of these basic principles that require certain intellectual activity , because you always think about variation with the subject that you have in mind .
and &quot; in words and fashion , there &apos;s the same rule / well , and not the first thing that had been the old collusion for the last one of the old one has been . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said &quot; well , maybe it isn &apos;t that ? &quot;
first -- my willingness to be to be a critical audience without suggesting my thing to suggest .
it &apos;s my intention to go back to finish up , should you have not understood it .
so in large and all they &apos;re saving our survival .
jews often have an awkward smell .
if the room pump , we could see that people were more negative attitudes to more likely to be able to die .
it &apos;s like i was talking about talking about what i did in this 20 years .
it feeds my spirit and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what cinema means .
without eating food , i became sick .
we don &apos;t need any more trouble out of idiots .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the thought that we have all these kids , it &apos;s one generation , we have a whole generation of children that had to go through so much psychological trauma or damage to africa .
and through all the book , more than an hour of <unk> and interactive animations .
what is business doing ?
it had seemed to be the seem that you could be able to be very true to the most true .
so i thought , &quot; yeah , this is probably a good idea . &quot;
they still talk about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern southern southern california , and you &apos;re going to go back to the spanish <unk> on the roofs and things .
rsw : how does his schedule ?
the <unk> -- they &apos;ve sent me to interviewed and picked their technical <unk> to bilbao .
this has reminded me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you &apos;re three months of <unk> , the ideas will always be clear and more more living .
and one thing i wanted to mention about my favorite book , but somehow missed , was to thank all companies that helped me work on the prototype .
but meanwhile , they gain momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand .
you see the suits , the suits .
the cacophony of <unk> and things is remarkable , and this is what they should be the <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five landscapes and the sixth is built here .
on this level , they work around 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computer on the world are recycling in china .
it was fairly unusual , so stefan , so less than five percent of advertising had a picture of the subject issue .
and wish three is : <unk> . i was told to myself , and i always wanted to work on this thing .
and it becomes increasingly more important that we find out how we can gain these low complex <unk> .
the traditional ways of dividing material , don &apos;t work for the <unk> .
traditional way , making water production , is happening with oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have mixed with a mixed acid groups : many different kinds of qualities and many different qualities of plastics .
now i see lots of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , again and again .
maybe we should investigate how monkeys make choices and find out whether they make the same kinds of dopamine , like we .
here &apos;s mayday . it &apos;s going to take one token for food and wait for you , and you get your food .
they waits slightly impatient to the market opens .
imagine that i push each of you $ 1,000 dollars of dollars , you can take 10 dollars of notes .
you can either vote any loss of loss -- like , i throw a coin , you &apos;re going to get a lot of lose .
if we made the same scenarios , they would do the same things like people do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not only people on the last stage of development that make dumb mistakes .
and this is the catch .
but if we think about wood buildings , they are only four stories tall .
we need to build concrete and steel and we have to build higher , and we &apos;ve worked on <unk> <unk> .
this is just as much as we would have a year , 900 cars on the streets .
<unk> curtains : my windows .
maybe &quot; citizen &quot; because recently , she got up to fight against the deterioration of law , and citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
<unk> , the largest and oldest bank in russia , mostly in the possession of the russian government , now using crowdsourcing to use employees and citizens in developing innovation .
we &apos;ve heard talks about ted who are familiar with arduino with arduino , and working on this world , to motivate young people to make young people and make websites and spin videos .
and so i started thinking that mama eternal says , &quot; are all children there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to pass a message , and all read in their own language , a central version of the golden rule , which was a version of the golden rule , &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do you do not do any others . &quot;
one pastor is called to take care of these individual needs .
and we do this by some of the <unk> .
